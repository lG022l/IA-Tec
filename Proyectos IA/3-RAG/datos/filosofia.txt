---

**CONCEPTO:** Fin de los Metarrelatos (Lyotard)
**AUTOR:** Jürgen Habermas
**DEFINICION:** Habermas’s critique of the decline of the “public sphere” mirrors Lyotard’s assertion that the grand narratives (metarrelatos) of modernity – such as Marxism, Enlightenment rationalism – have lost their credibility, leaving a fragmented and uncertain landscape of knowledge and truth.

**RELACION CON GEN Z:** Gen Z’s intense focus on self-improvement, productivity, and the pursuit of “perfect” lives, often amplified through social media, reflects the “culture of performance” outlined by Byung-Chul Han. The constant need to present a successful and engaging self online contributes to feelings of anxiety and inadequacy.

---

**CONCEPTO:** Vigilancia y Biopoder (Foucault)
**AUTOR:** Jürgen Habermas (Raises questions about the expansion of power)
**DEFINICION:** Habermas's concerns about the public sphere and the potential for power to permeate all aspects of social life aligns with Foucault’s concept of “biopower,” where power operates not just through repression but through the management of populations (e.g., through surveillance, data collection, and social engineering).

**CONCEPTO:** Existential Void / “Nothingness”
**AUTOR:** Martin Heidegger
**DEFINICION:** Heidegger’s central idea is that human existence (Dasein) is fundamentally characterized by a lack of inherent meaning, a “nothingness” or “void” that we must confront and engage with. 
**RELACION CON GEN Z:** This concept resonates with Gen Z’s anxieties surrounding purpose and meaning in a hyper-connected, rapidly changing world. The feeling of being overwhelmed by choices and a lack of a clear, externally-defined purpose aligns with Heidegger's notion of confronting the void. Social media, with its curated realities and emphasis on self-promotion, can exacerbate this feeling.

---

**CONCEPTO:** Fin de los Metarrelatos
**AUTOR:** Jean-François Lyotard

---

**CONCEPTO:** Biopower & Surveillance
**AUTOR:** Foucault
**DEFINICION:** Foucault posits that power isn’t just repressive; it’s productive—it shapes and governs populations through techniques of “biopower,” focusing on managing life itself (health, reproduction, etc.), and increasingly through surveillance technologies.
**RELACION CON GEN Z:**  The constant data collection by social media platforms and the use of algorithms to target individuals with personalized content directly relate to Foucault’s concepts. Gen Z's awareness of being monitored and manipulated by algorithms fuels anxieties about privacy and control.

---

**CONCEPTO:** De-habilitaion / Technification of Being
**AUTOR:** Heidegger
**DEFINICION:** Heidegger critiques modernity's emphasis on technological rationality and its reduction of human beings to mere “standing-reserve” – beings manipulated and controlled by technology.

---

**CONCEPTO:** Erosion of the Public Sphere
**AUTOR:** Habermas
**DEFINICION:** Habermas argues that the rise of mass media and the privatization of life have eroded the public sphere – the space for rational debate and collective action – creating fragmented and polarized societies.

**CONCEPTO:** Liquid Modernity
**AUTOR:** Zygmunt Bauman
**DEFINICION:** The shift from stable, institutionally-defined modern societies (solid modernity) to transient, fluid networks and short-term arrangements, characterized by a lack of stable frameworks and increasing uncertainty.
**RELACION CON GEN Z:** Gen Z navigates a world shaped by this fluidity through social media, where performative identity and constant self-reinvention are normalized. The emphasis on “being seen” and chasing trends aligns with Bauman’s concept of a “hunter’s utopia”—a perpetual pursuit of validation within a constantly shifting symbolic marketplace. The constant need for validation through likes and followers reflects the pressure to maintain visibility and relevance within this liquid landscape.

---

**CONCEPTO:** Fin de los Metarrelatos
**AUTOR:** Zygmunt Bauman
**DEFINICION:** The decline of overarching, universal narratives—such as religion, Marxism, or grand historical narratives—that once provided meaning and stability to societies.
**RELACION CON GEN Z:** Gen Z is growing up in a world without these unifying narratives, leading to a sense of meaninglessness and a search for individual authenticity. This resonates with the fragmentation Bauman describes, as Gen Z individuals grapple with the absence of shared belief systems and construct their own identities in a decentralized way, often fueled by online communities and influencers.

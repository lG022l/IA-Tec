FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “Nobody wants to work anymore” coming from a retired Boomer could trigger my fight or flight like an activation phrase for a sleeper agent.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Applying for jobs is humiliation ritual at this point
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Me after getting ghosted by 2000 companies:  “You guys are getting rejection emails?”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “Gen Z is the least resilient generation.” Did this presumably millennial man forget they said the same thing about millennials a decade ago?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My friend got ghosted after completing her I-9. Literally hired but never given a start date.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ai rejecting my ai written resume is meta asf
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I know that everyone is saying it will be fine and we can fix this, but it is TERRIFYING when you have nowhere to go and no family to rely on. If I don't find a second job on top of my job and my gigs, I'll be homeless. And honestly, I have it easier than other people in those regards, too. This is terrifying. People will die.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Don't apply on indeed." Okay but when I go to the Canadian Job Board and click a job to apply for, it gives me a button to take me to their indeed post. It's like a terrible groundhog day cycle, you'll never escape it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen X here, when we started working they called us unprofessional and lazy, when millennials started working they called them unprofessional and lazy, now it’s Gen Z‘s turn to be called that. It’s tiresome. 🤨
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yup people are like maybe it’s you, when I said I have applied to over 1,000 jobs and never heard back or got like 5 rejections. Like people would say I applied wrong maybe or that I should redo my resume. Like it’s always it’s a YOU issue and not it’s a job market issue.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My 19 year old son has applied for hundreds of jobs over the past year. He was unable to find employment until this week. When he interviewed, the McDonalds (yep) manager said she has no clue wby he hadnt been hired yet, since McDs alone interviewed him a couple times before.  The job market for kids with no job history is insane. Not only that, the jobs theyre getting wont even be able to pay rent, much less other bills and life.  Im really worried about the future of our kids folks.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “Do you have any experience working as ___” No, but i have experience doing this very similar thing at previous jobs “we cant hire you because you dont have enough experience”  AND ITS EVERY. SINGLE. JOB.  “you dont have enough experience working retail”  HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GAIN EXPERIENCE WORKING IN RETAIL IF NOBODY WILL HIRE ME BECAUSE I DONT HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE WORKING RETAIL?  LIKE WHAT😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: you missed the big one. The cost of housing is completely out of control. It isn't even close to reality anymore how expensive a house costs and the people putting shit on the market are in denial, keeping their listings up for months instead of dropping the price.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "have a great day!" "...great day." "great day!" "great day?" "great day!!" i am now having a very not great day.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it's like a dead MMO where only ones left are veterans & they're not welcoming to newcomers
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The one at 8:56 broke my heart a little bit, it looks like she dressed up and everything even though it was a phone interview so she made an extra effort and then to be met by a machine, “hi-…” poor kid 😢
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I applied to a job in March 2020 and finally heard back in July 2021 lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s not that Gen Z doesn’t want to work, it’s that Gen Z doesn’t want to slave away for literally nothing. Boomers used to throw away every little bit of dignity they had, but at least it was worth it for them. They knew they’d get a promotion, can afford a nice home, go on a vacation and sustain a family just by one person in the household having a decent job.  It all seems so pointless, why put in any effort if you know it won’t amount to anything of value?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hate the feeling as if I’m failing as an adult for not having a proper corporate job. I don’t make enough to move out of my mom’s home. I can’t afford to be Independent. I feel so embarrassed to be struggling like this at 24.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: we're not heading to a recession; WE ARE CURRENTLY IN ONE!! WERE IN IT!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There are literally newspapers from like 100 years ago saying that. It’s so ridiculous. The truth is no one wants to hire or no one wants to train or no one wants to pay fairly.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @thedreammweaver6274  of course there are. The generation before the boomers were lazy and all the generations after the boomers are lazy. They’re the only ones who work /j
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​ @thedreammweaver6274 and thats mainly boomer/gen x fault! They dont take accountability for it too. They literally put robots OVER US AND LET ROBOTS TAKE OUR JOBS
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Retired boomers having ANY opinion about jobs rn make me feral
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @tallsockclown  my parents are constantly going “Look at Indeed! There are so many jobs out there!!” Like bro 😟🔫
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I usually do not let things like that online get to me but this phrase in particular BOILS MY BLOOD bc we’re literally WORKING OUR ASSES OFF AND WE GET NOTHING IN RETURN
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I quit my job after being told I was getting a raise then it was retracted. They pushed all of the best people out to make it a ghost town of what it was. They don’t listen to any criticism, management are all passive aggressive and love to brag. When I quit they were in disbelief, even though they were told it would happen. This is the shit we all have to put up with and I’m a bartender. So I can’t imagine doing 4 years at University and dealing with this stuff 🤬
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I asked my boomer parents to look for a part time job (but not interview if they get called) just to see how hard it is, and tell me how it goes.   They’ve been quiet.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​ @MilkByCow  I've gotta try this with my parents!!! But for a full time job. THIS!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In my country, they got multiple thousands of dollars in the early 00s to buy a house. Just because. From the government. Now, if you want to study and don't have money, you'll have to basically strip naked to get a few hundred euros a month that can barely cover your rent. And then the boomers complain that the young people are costing way too much with their laziness. Like... Huh?????
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Here’s the thing about boomers—half of them REFUSE to even retire in the first place!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @FatHedgie  i feel like boomers were the first ones to come up with ageism in the workplace for this exact reason. Wisdom or no, they are occupying young people's positions
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @FatHedgie Because (in the US at least) they got shafted too. They hold onto their jobs for dear life well past retirement because the SSA and even 401k and Medicare systems they've been convinced to buy into for their entire life were never all that they've been cracked up to be, and they're starting to realize that in order to survive with little functioning social support, they need to keep working. Of course that makes it harder for entry level folks to find work and receive appropriate training as a spillover effect. But try and resist the temptation to engage in generational blame (at most, only collective for not having the political will to push for a better system for everyone) and focus instead on efforts to make the system better not fixating on past failures.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Most of what boomers say to me triggers my fight or flight
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hear so many people say this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: or worse. a boomer who refuses to retire and is taking up space due to tenure so they cant be fired :))
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They complain about the children they didnt raise or prepare for the world, they also didnt pay attention to the world or country or anything and just had an easy care free life. "why dont boomers love their kids?" is a better question. Like we didnt decide to be born that was on you guys "wanting" families.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Omg my mom says this shit all the time even though she isn’t even 40 yet 😭 HELPPPPP pls 😔 When I was on a job hunt for months, applying non-stop for work she would say that over and over and over. Legit drove me nuts.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Unironically the line "nobody wants to work anymore" has been said since the time of king's and queens, people just want serfs again and thats how they say it lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “your generation just doesn’t want to work anymore” coming from my coworker while I’m at work actually covering a shift from the same middle aged person that keeps calling out.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Pisses me off because I’ve tried so fucking hard.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hope it activates your fight response if you know what i mean
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don’t think anybody ever wanted to work. The difference is being willing to work and I think everyone is willing to work because we need money to live or else.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: fkn this! they literally destroyed the economy then blame younger generations for its destruction
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I had one who’s parents are millionaires and who’s husband makes 22 million a year tell me I’m lazy for leaving on my scheduled time😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: OK BOOMER still works wonders, just use that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was in a waiting room in a clinic when I heard that. She was complaining about the nurses, when I knew they were understaffed. Nobody wants to do the job of 3 people for 1990 pay, more like.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Retired boomers have no place speaking on the shit we deal with as genz and millenials.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just mention social security is socialism
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i have a screenshot of multiple newspaper starting from the 19th or early 20th century about how no one wants to work anymore. meanwhile in some areas during medieval europe people worked only 150 days a year
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah lol there’s not much left to work for anyways.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That boomer rhetoric will have you in the ward for sure. Especially if you grew up with it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That quote starts to make me foam at the mouth because it’s so entitled and ignorant.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If someone said that to my face my response would be that I actually work 3 jobs and I am a single young adult who is self-sufficient and keeps a roof over her heard and food in her belly, then I would knock them out
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You all, are not deserving of the wisdom I wish to bestow upon thee. Where the wisdom I must share, must break your world view. Therefore I banish it to the back of my mind. It is up to you to see what you say and how you can look saying it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: lmao I’m a gm of a U-Haul at 26 years old my manager was 56 retired when I took over and literally I hire 4 people that work 3 days and quit all they have to do is sit at a computer and answer the phone every now n then no one wants to work period 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Either that or they judge you for working two jobs lmao, so out of touch.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Gen x or what the kids call Boomer.  The Gen X who say that are only aware of the stereotypes that social media puts out there. I respect y’all for not having blind loyalty to work over life balance.  My generation and the original boomers would work ourselves into oblivion neglecting our health and family.   Also there are plenty us 40 plus with the experience that are laid off with 20 plus years of experience, stuck in the same cycle figuring out how we are going to take care of our families, and you’re completely done if you’re laid off over 60.  If you’re young like I said in my other comment, the military is a viable option.  It’s my only regret not at least exploring that route when I couldn’t land a job out of college 25 years ago.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Many entry level positions have been lost to AI or automation as well.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Don't let it get under your skin. You can dismiss their comments automatically as delusional.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They could pay for their entire 2 semesters of college tuition with a summer job and they have the audacity to call gen z lazy 😂they literally live in a fantasy world where they’re so used to live benefiting from imperial super profits and got set up for life back when the economy was still good that they can’t even comprehend the world that gen z is living in cause they live in their pampered boomer world where they haven’t had to do a day of hard work in the better part of half a century
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yep, and that same boomer that now has to go back to work💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People fr don’t want to train like no job is really that hard to do any job can be taught unless you’re a doctor or scientist or something like that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its just fight that this point. No flight. I'm done running, I'm just throwing hands.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its honestly a winter soldier code at this point.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Tell them “old people don’t want to live anymore”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've had boomers tell me AT MY JOB tell me no one wants to work anymore.  WHY I'M WORKING!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: WHat? I know you all want to work. I know you want to work at what you’ve been trained for. I’m a boomer, and I know this thread sees me as some sort of enemy, but, I on your side. You are right. I see the problem as AI, it’s coming for everyone. Im a a nurse but who knows? I’ve seen what’s been happening, job loss to technology, housing loss to ‘investment’ portfolios. This is wrong. As only one person, I don’t know what to do. But….i have a small house, I need it to live in, but when I go, I promise you , it will never, ever be sold to a corporation. That’s what my family, sold it to an ACTUAL family,did when we sold my mother’s and that is what will happen when we sell my house….to a family, regardless  of how much money an *sshole investment offers.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I can assure you that the only people who don't want to work are the people with jobs
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m gonna start identifying as a fucking penguin
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Damn I’m sorry random peoples words weigh so heavy on you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: and then... will you just throw a tantrum and start crying in the floor while you wait for somebody to bring you a matcha latte and a rainbow flag?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Dude what is your problem. ​ @TheJamonLance
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: AI is coming for most jobs anyway. Meanwhile the blue collar still can't get gen z to work there.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @ChadsOfChristmasPasts because theres no point working a job that can even pay for basic needs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No, we're there we've just gotten sick of building peoples dreams for nothing in return
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ChadsOfChristmasPasts Even this isn’t true. The job search for blue collar jobs is rough. Will not contact back, require more and more qualifications for entry level every year. That and the unions are packed
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an employed Gen X tho in  on the floor retail,  I’ve got kids not smart enough to push a broom let alone do higher functioning stuff.  And they all think they’re up for manager in three weeks
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @JillPenton  ok, and? They’re apparently working with a condescending Gen Xer. As a former retail worker, middle management in retail isn’t exactly a bastion of intellect most of the time anyway.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I always chuckle when someone from the younger generations uses a disparaging term for older people, when at the same time the same young age group are known to be more sensitive about words and discrimination. Hypocrisy is funny
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @ozbelltemp  what? theyre literally the baby boomer generation.... we dont get mad at being called zoomers.... bc its just a faster way to say gen z. calling a literal label that existed before we were born discrimination is funny 😂😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ozbelltemp  back to bed now, peepaw
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ozbelltemp  This is so funny because Gen Z are just like "don't call minorities slurs you fucking freak", and then we say "Boomers" (Yknow??? Like Baby Boomers??? The Baby Boom after the war??? Baby Boomers???) and old people get offended. All that talk about thick skin, and y'all can't even handle objective based language. It's not like we're calling you a slur, you just ARE Boomers 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's even more humiliating when they actually call you in for an interview and after weeks of thinking you're finally gonna get a job, hours of perfecting resumes, making sure you're dressed up nice for the big day, they tell you to your face "You're not what we're looking for right now" 😭😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @kamii_kaizen I prefer that to being told, "oh you're great! We'll give you a call in a few days" and then ghosting you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @kamii_kaizen  frrrrr I applied to fleet farm for floor sales, and OMG I dressed up like I should, (I’m a boy btw) they brought me in for an interview with the general manager, and I promise you I’m more than qualified for the job, and they still did not hire me. 😢
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They do it on purpose to make people feel powerless so we don't try to change anything
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For sure. I had one interviewer pick apart my entire resume and basically berate me for an hour or 2 about why I shouldn’t have put basically anything onto it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just went for an interview, the HR literally told me after that they weren’t hiring but is just doing interview to hit the monthly fking quota for it as it’s required by his boss. JFC
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nah, I applied and got an interview and then was told to call back on Monday. I called on Monday and was told both of the managers went on a cruise. 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It always was. I started applying for work shortly after 2008. I filled out 100s of applications and was lucky if I got 1 or 2 interviews out of it, so I get what Gen Z is saying.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I did an interview for a small new company. They are not paying for lunch, an hour and a half drive from my home AND dont pay for extra hours. The HR lady started the interview by saying " im sorry but your resume is so so bad. Its plain, black and white, looks like you dont care about standing out." I ended up getting the position but quit before my first shift, because wtf is this even.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's the fact your parents can evict you from the house if your not making income but we're literally in a job crisis right now...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've raised my kids and now I need to start working and I don't even know how to apply anymore it's ridiculous. It really is humiliating trying to get a job at the grocery store at this point. I'm getting scared
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It was a humiliation thing 2019  I applied for so many jobs got interviews and never got the job.  I bought a business that was already successful a turnkey business and now I m begging God to sell it so i can stop working soo much
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Joke's on you. I'm into that stuff.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Literally like Literally literally
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wait until I tell you that people used to bring CV in person and had to talk to other humans every time. 😂 As a person who briefly worked in recruitment, HR doesn't giggle maniacally when they hit the automatic email response. Unless you write absolutely unhinged application, literally no one cares and you shouldn't, too.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @maewillow5680  Except that's exactly the issue. No one cares. So everybody ends up wasting everybody's time, which leads to it feeling like a humiliation ritual.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah y’all need to be humbled. An immigrant comes in and prosper while fools that got participation trophy whine and cry 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @romusa9204  sorry i don't want to work as food delivery biker on demand and live in poverty :0
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why? Because you have literally nothing to offer? Yeah... I guess that sucks
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Sagegabs 6/10 ragebait. Good and believable ragebait to provoke people in social media. Not so believable for more experienced users, however much better than average
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Sagegabs  you seem to be bad at understanding people
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Sagegabs You are not only blind to the problem, but part of it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fr. I called up at a place once after putting in an application and they gave me hella attitude saying “Oh we’ll call YOU if we wanted to interview you..” like bruh if you would give me an actual response I wouldn’t have to call up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Dude if you apply to 2,000 companies and don't hear back, it's you. You're either applying to fake positions or your resume is crap. Applying to jobs is hard but that's excessive.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah it's really disappointing seeing fellow millennials just slowly turning into the cursed boomer generation all over again.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @shinjite06 The eternal Boomer is in all of us. Just raise someone with instant succss and a lack of appreciation for the hard work and systems that set them into their place of success and they too can become an entitled narcissist Boomer. Its something we all need to watch as we get older and if the economy ever does pick back up. And remember that it can happen to your kids if you arent careful.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @shinjite06 we aren’t. We just think that maybe genz should step up and actually fight for change. Millenials turn out to vote at least.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@shinjite06 And I think Gen Z will turn into that too. It's sad.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly, these endless articles sh*tting on Gen Z is the same thing they did to millennials 10 years ago. They strum up hatred for profit.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I can at least say, most Millennials have sympathy. Most.  Most of use remember the post 2008 suffering. You guys are alright.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Canadish yeah most millennials are chill but i think a lot of them are mad about gen z clowning on them now too or were too hardened by gen y
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People who shit on the next generation coming up r always stupid I worked with gen z n they cool
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And Genxers and Boomers before...it's nothing new to shit on whoever is the youngest gen at any given time. I very much remember my gen being called the "me" generation when I was finishing high school.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am a millennial and I definitely don’t think this. I am jobless rn.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's insane to see some millennials do that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Complaining about "youths these days" is as old as humanity. I remember, like ten years ago, that a lot of people from my generation said that they will never become like that and work together and support gen z instead. Really disapointing to see so many not staying true to that now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: RESILIENT IVE ONLY BEEN ALIVE FOR 2 DECADES LEAVE ME ALONE IM NEWLY CONSCIOUS
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's misery loves company. Colorfully called the asshole system. You suffered, you assume others should have to too. Boomers are the epitome of this. They complained that Greatest held the power forever and made decisions on behalf of generations that would be around to deal with the consequences. In turn, they became that and more.  It's a historically accurate thing. The only part that breaks it down is education and people remembering the struggle and going "that absolutely wasn't fair, why the hell is this still happening? I should have had to go through it and neither should anyone else."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Did they forget that the youngest generations are always the least resilient, because that's how growing up works? As a general rule younger people with less experience dealing with problems are going to struggle more than someone older who has been through those kinds of problems before learned how to deal with them
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “Gen Z is the least resilient generation” says a man upset that Gen Z refuses to be a doormat  probably had one 16 year old tell him to (politely) fuck off when he tried to call them into work while they were at school
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennials weren't brain rotted and glued to their phones all day.  Millennials also didn't doom spend all their money on door dash and labubus
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The least resilient, or the least willing to put up with a system of cruelty?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They say this about anyone advocating for themselves or standing for worker rights n labor laws
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Our generation, Gen Z, will be lucky if there’s anything left for us here. I’m planning to GTFO by 2030.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Almost like gen z are young or something 🤯
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They were right over a decade ago, and we're right about this, haha. It just shows how embarrassing gen z really really is
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: its not a generational thing from my experience. put gen Z in the same scenario or toxic environments as prior generations, they'll do the same. you all are naive.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ve noticed that this is something that happens predominantly with republican millennials, they have no thoughts of their own and they just regurgitate everything they get told without questioning it so they take the stuff the boomers say and just puke it back up
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You think it’s bad now?  Wait until the boomers die and the millenials inherit all their wealth.  The Millenial arc will then be complete.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Johnrl21 the majority of millenials aren't going to inherit anything. We're in the middle of a massive wealth transfer of billionaires taking the money from the Boomers/Gen X.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennials have way more in common with boomers than gen x tbh so it tracks. Seems like generations alternate between being fucking embarrassing or not
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @trentn1127 nah, only rich millennials are like boomers. Most of us have more in common with gen z. I'm an elder millennial and me and my peers are way more in line with gen z colleagues, probably coz of Internet culture homogenenising our interests and culture and our attachment to 'childish' things as a way of coping with life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it's always this "time is a currency" mindset with them, but when it comes to interviews they be treating you like you got all the time in the world and your time ain't worth nothing since you live to serve them. We're just straight up npcs without any thoughts or needs to them
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nice. They hired someone and effectively gave them no hours.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ChadsOfChristmasPasts exactly what happened to me, never got called in after working ONE day and since then, still nothing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There is a lawsuit here, but the only juice you get from the squeeze is vengeance. If you can find an attorney who will take it on contingency, it’s worth knocking the company for a few grand. Just don’t take the force hire option.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i believe it! had something similar happen to me!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, I had to call to start at PetSmart. To be fair, they're severely understaffed. And with the restructuring from corporate, everyone is doing the work at least 2 positions, if not 3. I got hired at the end of August, & it's mid-late September, and some of my training feels like borderline hazing. I love my job, but the job market and corporate culture is messed up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got “hired” at taco bell but was never given an I-9, and when i called back they would tell me to call later.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i was dragged along for a dunkin donuts position for six months. was hired by the regional manager herself. signed paperwork. was supposed to be scheduled for training when the previous manager quit. the new manager continually hired new people and refused to train ANY of them. dozens of other people went through this.   when she was finally let go for being such a shit manager, i went in to speak to the new one to get trained.  by that point it had taken too long and i was no longer in the system. was told to apply for the 3am starter position.   I walked out and never looked back.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Tell her to check her credit and lock it down. Completing her I-9 has a lot of personal info.  Her identity has just been stolen by a corporation. Tell her to get a lawyer and press charges the SECOND that something happens with her identity
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That could be an identity theft scam
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That happened to me, too. Like I just gave you ny Social Security # and bank info and yall dont call me back???

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THAT HAPPENED TO ME AND THEN I SHOWED UP AND THEY FUCKING FIRED ME
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: that's exactly what happened to me. Filled out all the paperwork gave them my SSN and everything and then I showed up and they said they had no idea who I was despite going to the building for the interview.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @JG-jc6fx  damn, so what is going on? Are these companies just stealing people's SSN's??
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: my ex friend had a job at a sonic, completed training and everything and then they (sonic) never called them back. i told them to keep calling and be annoying about it and, to my knowledge, it didnt work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I mean, if I was hired and I never heard back from them, I would reach out to see what the hell is going on…..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: YEAH THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME MORE THAN ONCE

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Has happened to me 3 times this year!!!!!!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: that happened to me at literally fucking mcdonald’s. this economy is ridiculous
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I remember when filling out the W-4 and I-9 were done on your first day, and you actually got paid to spend the time to fill out all that paperwork. Sometime after 2020, every company decided that the onboarding process was something new hires need to do BEFORE they can start working.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This exact thing happened to me at forever 21, gave them my soc and everything 😭😭😭 they outta business now tho
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think this is literally happening to me rn. I'm tweaking because I haven't been making money for almost a full month, and I need to pay rent
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @jacksonbarstow995 may u rest in peace🙏
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: She should walk in and assert her dominance (I am only half joking)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 3 dealerships this year "hired" me, had me fill out intake paperwork, and then just... never scheduled my drug test or start date. atleast fuckin KIA had the decency to tell me "Yeah sorry we got downsized by corporate" after the 25th phone call
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this was literally almost me, they got back to me, but it took forever after they hired me to get me started that i literally started working on an rbt cert
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It has happened to me, but only after I took a picture that they cancelled on-site interviews the day they scheduled me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That’s fucking terrifying. Christ almighty.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 2nd interview youre going get hired  means you might be ghosted
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And she didn't ask, nor show up....wtf
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Jughead24 how do you know she didn’t? Were you there? 💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Jughead24 assume much? Name fits
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “Gen Z is so smart, everyone else are morons” lol this video is the exact reason why as a millennial I can’t be friends with Gen Z. No sense of awareness of your lack of lived experience.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @sharyna we weren’t begging to be friends with you to begin with.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @sharynaif that was your takeaway from this video it might be an intellect issue on your part.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@sharyna no ones the same even if your somewhat right your wrong
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: diabolical , looks like world has to take break from "AI breakthroughs" and started reversing back  to 80s
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I dont think you know what meta means
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Or how hard is it to make a resume on ur own? You literally just put ur work experience and ur skills and like ur info. It’s not hard???
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @existing196   That does not make a difference, I can assure you on that <3 And why should we feel obligated to hand-make a resume that'll never be seen by human eyes? No, it's not hard to make one. But that's not the point of this conversation (proving if it's hard to make a resume). Focusing on "ai written resumes" is detracting from the argument. We WANT to work, we're NOT LAZY, and yet everyone treats us AS IF WE ARE. Why does it even matter to you that the resume is/isn't written by ai? Its a f**king resume, not a Steven King novel or a YT script.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah and if you do become homeless, well instead of helping they would rather make being homeless illegal lol. I'm not sure if that's still something being talked about
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Actually though. I'm terrified of my parents dying
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @creepcraddle me too...and im in my 40s 😢
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @creepcraddle my parents passed away these past 2 years… hope you got grandparents
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And it's getting much more dangerous being homeless. You're completely vulnerable. To other random homeless and the psychos that have nothing better to do than drive around seeking homeless to harass or attack.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I would've already been homeless if it weren't for my family.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No, it is not fine and nothing is going to fix this short of a total meltdown of present day capitalism. We're speedrunning ourselves into another great depression while simultaneously burning the world's entire ecosystem to ashes in the pursuit of "artificial intelligence"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @TheRiverweasel09 we’re basically omega cooked… wanna play games or something
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeah and living alone also means paying for healthcare or out of pocket to doctors, bills, and groceries.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah having no support system makes it 200x worse. A lot of people CAN'T live with their parents. That's how people end up living in their car. But no one can even afford a car anymore.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I let people camp on my property. They chip in for utilities, I make sure they always get fed. Sometimes I find them work for cash.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yea I used to vote mixed until after 2016. We desperately need a shift in Congress and the Senate. No one has our interests in mind but is the worst self inflicted damage I've seen an administration do.  Votes really matter. These tariffs are killing us. And consumer and employee protections are quietly disappearing right now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Mr___f  Yup, We need real progressives, The ones they have in Norway, and Sweden, The ones that despite doing things that are "expensive", unlike america riches country in the WORLD still have a government SURPLUS.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I know it is. Take it one day at a time. Hang in there. Everything is temporary. Hoping opportunities come your way asap!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@caseyw.6550 I appreciate it, but I didn't mean this as a vent. More of a reminder that things that seem temporary or small to some could end lives for others.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “Land of the free” we’re becoming a prison priced out of happiness
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Only way to fix it is to crack down on offshoring.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @sonnywilson748 We have, hasn't fixed the issue.   The issue is monoplization of the market place. Just like it was in the 20s.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeah, indeed. So when it turns out you have to go to an unpaid 8am meeting and miss your gym sesh to get it done: The guy who doesn't want to 'die' is gonna be the guy who sucks it up and does that job. The thing about all the people going on about how "this aint fair, this aint right", yeah sure, maybe you have a point. i can empathize with that. But you also need to realize you're out there competing for jobs with people who don't care about any of that and want the work. They'll worry about finding a place that meets all their expectations after they are already working.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Usersunited That's true. The people who need to survive are also the most easily exploitable. I was direction my comment towards a specific thing he said in the video. I can't remember the time stamp now, but generally it was an idea a lot people have: that we'll be fine in the end and that eventually, it'll turn out okay. I wanted to point out that eventually is still going to kill people along the way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: True that sounds worse… I also live alone and things are worse . I am thinking of learning skills even without assurance I’ll be in work force
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im above minimum wage and still can't afford all the essentials  Its taking 3 family members working to pay for the house
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thats me 25 adopted no family homeless can't get ahead before I die I'm going out very loud
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How about this.. what if my sibling intentionally went into student loan debt for higher education but i suffer from her taking her anger out on me so.. lets just say she deserve no family member to help her we do not want her to rely on us because we are being verbally abused over my siblings complaint about bad economy and bad job market
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@S88S55 I mean, that is a separate situation to what I was taking about. If you're being abused, you can't financially support your abuser, and it's not healthy to live with them. I was speaking from the lens of people who don't have families, have been disowned, or had to run away or abandon family and have no one to rely on.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: !! I go in person, and they tell me to apply via Indeed. Fellow Canadian and it’s rough out here
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @bunnyfrosting1744 wait it’s bad in canada too?!! - asking for an american 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Dont forget pending lmia exception 😩
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh or the JobBank; it gives you their email and is like "good luck bro! Hope you can be professional enough to get them to respond to you!"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The government job bank doesn't actually have jobs posted. It's all LMIA scams (they have to have proof of a job posting being up for some amount of time) before they're allowed to apply for an LMIA
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is the scary part about indeed. In the western world its often the ONLY major job board. They have millions if not hundreds of millions of CVs going through there system every day
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I had job where I did a temp receptionist position for three days . They had a logistics position open that I had years of experience in interviewed didn’t hire me for that role and  “forgot” to pay me I had to email them. They reached out to me a year later to do another three day temp work .
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Then have indeed tell you you need to apply through the company site then have the company site tell you you need a resume then you type one up but it isnt the right file tipe jpg, pdf, ect. Or indeed sends you to another job app that you need to download to apply for the job cause the company only takes applications through that app.... Jump through 3 burning hoops to get a job jumping through burning hoops to do a job no one else wants....
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Indeed really wouldn't suck if employers actually checked... 😒
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wow I didn't realize it was bad in Canada too :(
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was told I should put an ad in the paper......hahahaha
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ive gotten all my jobs on indeed whats wrong with it?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @aliyahsakeena how actually how 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly. And I try to find local hiring and they never answer back whether I fill out my background or not. Some of the applicants sent me to Facebook?!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fellow Canadian. Blue collar is the only thing that is hiring with good pay.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: man i live 30+ mins away from everywhere, it costs too much to physically go in to 20 locations a day and fill out papers
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @omnilov3rr  you gotta go on an adventure buddy.  3 years ago I got kicked out of my dads house in the middle of nowhere in BC. I ended up in Alberta making good money. Dont let inhibitions stop you from moving and finding a place and job that makes you happy. No matter the cost you must succeed, ultimately you should never live to be close to your parents or your friends. Love finds ppl across the entire planet. But you can only find yourself.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You have to have a covering letter with the indeed applications even though it says optional. They do actually notice
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Facts! I dislike that it’s so inescapable
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That’s weird people say this, because all the jobs I’ve gotten were through indeed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My favourite is when you have to click through five different websites just to finally reach the original job post; only to find out it doesn’t even exist anymore.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If it's on indeed, it's usually a scam.  I found that applying on the company's website was much easier and safer than trying to apply on a third party site that allows any job post regardless of its legitimacy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Go in person and hand them a physical piece of paper. Or talk to friends and see if anyone is working someplace thats hiring.   Im not trying to be disrespectful and tell you you’re doing something wrong. Ideally what young people are doing should work. But in the world we live in you have to stand out and leave impressions and a bunch of words that gets reviewed by AI looking for key words is not how you stand out. Print off 10-20 copies of your resume after putting it through an AI resume creator, and hand it out to a bunch of places in town you would enjoy working at. Keep one or two in case you go to a cat cafe or something and they happen to be hiring and the rest is waiting sadly.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Juniorthepuppymaker  most places won’t acknowledge real paper now
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just go to the company website and apply there then
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Forcebewithyou594  the point is that most company websites redirect you to places like indeed
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s not indeed entirely - it’s just because it’s one of the biggest job search sites. You need to use some due diligence and look to see if it actually seems real.  Also gotta say to stop applying for remote jobs
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Boomers, especially the conservatives, have an unbreakable habit of projecting in every single accusation they make. 99% of them didn’t have to work nearly as hard as we do, they were born in the most economically prosperous period in America. I bet the silent generation absolutely despises the boomers, even more than the rest of us do 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @UncleEugene72   Boomers are out of touch and think money grows on trees. I’ve seen first hand their attitude towards money which to them is something abundant for them to throw around like it's nothing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I remember being a preteen in the mid 2010’s and seeing all the headlines about how “millennials are lazy” “millennials can’t find jobs” “millennials don’t want to work” and I’ve started wondering if this is just an endless cycle. Good to know my hunch was right. I vow to never buy into this narrative when they inevitably start talking about Gen Alpha like this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm not in the US, but we have a similar situation in my country too. You just send your job applications everywhere and you never hear back from them, like the CV goes to a void or idk.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: A lot of these comments prove my point 😂 yall are funny but yes over 1000 over a year. And they were all fast food or retail so idk what to tell you about quality in a resume for such a job. I’m sorry you guys are too funny 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's always easier to blame the individual rather then the broken system that's created the situation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sorry about all the random in the replies still saying it's you lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yep in the UK we have to do these weekly meetings where you have to prove youve applied for jobs to get your money to eat and the 'job coaches' just think you are lazy and are trying to sponge off the government and just keep highlighting how low the unemployment rate is and just try to blame you for everything.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Welcome to capitalism. Nothing is wrong with the system; it's all your fault.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yesterday i had a family member who knows im struggling look me in the eye and dedass ran my resume thru gemini
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @christiansnaturestudio6599  How does one quit adulthood?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it is always your fault somehow, this applies to other things in life too
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You applied to 1000 jobs.  How can you possibly know 1000 companies you wish to work for. That’s like DM ing 1000 people to find your true love.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Unemployment is the highest it’s ever been at what, 13% right?  So that means 87% of people are better than you and able to get a job?  For the record, I’m going through the work too with these applications. I just don’t see how you can blame the system alone. There is ALWAYS something I find I can do to keep myself busy, even if it is a mere personal project or self learning.   Jobs hire for expertise. If you’re unemployed or doing some boring job, find something you like, and just do it in your free time until anyone you talk with knows less than you about it.  Not enough time? Cut into gym. Cut into sleep. Cut into free time, family time. It’s not ideal, but know it’s temporary. Suffer now to make better later.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @SarcasticMonkeys  the system is vile especially corporations work hard and get nothing in the end it's just a grind hopefully things change in the next decade.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: lots of factors involved such as your resume, cover letter... applying doesn't guarantee your success or failure, only the quality of the application. and, since 1000 applications is clearly quantity over quality, you should re evaluate your choices instead of blaming outer circumstances like a child.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @patxo8521  Who are you who is so wise in the ways of the world?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Tell me, how many trades have you learned?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@jamess359 what trades can a 40 year old women go into? Im pretty weak, btw.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @jamess359 a certain level of anxiety is needed in the labor market for the economy to function l
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm sorry, a 1000? That's 100% you, statistics show that the average number of people don't even come close to this in their lifetime. Average is ~30 with multiple interviews, so... you are the problem.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Number1RichPianaFan  so millions are the issue not the job market wow victim blaming much.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Number1RichPianaFan  ok, boomer
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Number1RichPianaFan boomer take
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: and we’re still wondering why birth rates are dropping
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: thanks for not blaming him at least. sorry to be this kind of party pooper but i really wish, my parents understood, how fucked the job market is for us haha. you're a blessing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For real, my sister is only 21 and she's had 1 job at Burger King, and she hasnt been able to find a job at all. She is very hard working, its been so hard compared to when I was young with no expirence and im only started working like 8 years ago??
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The irony of the boomers is that their parents lived through the great depression and ww2. Do you think they learned so that there kids wouldn’t have to suffer what their parents did? Oh hell no they set up an economy that would have them set for life and doom the world when they’re gone. Even more there the only generation slimy enough to think it deserves a seat in politics for a world that last passed them by.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah I also worked at Walmart Homegoods all types of retail now all sudden I can’t even get a job In Retail lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: At the rate things are going, the children of Gen Z will be literally priced out of existing in America
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Don’t be, everything will end soon
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why even have kids in the first place??
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My friend had to close her tree service company because she couldn’t find anyone to work for $25 an hour, $65 for climbers.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @LilyGazou  that sounds like there was a problem with marketing the open positions, or someone was lying about job details
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Your generation was the problem, looking for ways to make a buck and ways to cut cost for YOUR pockets, why don’t you sell your homes for 40k and give this generation a chance, nope you want to be greedy until your very last breath
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @luiedoesstuff  yes because this random commenter is responsible for everything bad happening right now. /s
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @luiedoesstuff aint nobody giving up their houses 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You can literally do the old school thing and walk into these fabrication or metal shops and ask for a job. Thats the issue you guys keep trying to go to corporate jobs lol go to an area filled with blocks of factories and tell him to go ask in person. Its really not hard to think outside that box I have yet never not been able to find a ducking job you guys are pathetic
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SZJA Dude, please. If you try to walk up in person, they tell you to apply online. And if you take initiative to call them after to follow up, hiring managers have said they specifically don’t hire people who do that because they are “too needy”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @SZJA lol are you serious? If you try to do that these days you'll be laughed out of the building. Best case scenario they give you a coffee and calmly explain why they can't take you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m guessing you’re a boomer This is your fault
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fr if everyone needs experience in that field to perform in that field then how do you perform in that field-
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just lie about it. Say you worked at Bed Bath & Beyond or something
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Retail jobs require experience now? Okay, we're cooked. 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I totally agree with you, and Retail is supposed to be a Entry level job
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah but there’s someone that does have the experience so they don’t give af about you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Seriously. So many of these homes were bought during Covid and were way overvalued. The sellers are trying to recoup the money they overpaid, but it’s just not gonna work like that. If a house worth 250k was bought for 300K, the next person is not gonna pay 350K for it. The seller can either take the L or keep the house on the market for the next three years.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Still waiting for that big crash everyone's talking about smh.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @NI-ko5kt crashes aren’t all that common, housing generally just goes up unless there’s a really crazy issue like the housing crisis of 2007 which has largely been corrected. Locally it might rise and lower a bit, but it probably won’t full on crash. Again, there’s some rare wild exceptions, but housing is usually considered to be a safe investment for a reason.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @NI-ko5kt Housing crash is gonna feel like when my eardrum ruptured when I was 3. It's gonna suck, but it's only up from there
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: fr i was working fulltime plus overtime while i was homeless. Town clerk knew my family so she managed to get me a motel room before winter came so i wouldn't freeze to death in my car.  The motel room had no wifi and no hot water, located in a slum ass town. Never spoke to my neighbors bc all of them were on drugs and constantly infecting each other with bedbugs (which i thankfully never got).  If I'm ever homeless again I'm seriously just going to end it. Only reason I'm alive is bc someone rescued my stray dog ass off the streets the night i was gonna go through with it. Insanely lucky...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Here in Mexico city most good houses/apartments are becoming Airbnbs!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Deadass there is a smallish house on my road that has been for sale for a year now, way over valued even for the area (they have not lowered from the $480,000 they started at), when the house itself is arguably only worth around $120,000, probably less after they painted it entirely over with a shitty white thats slowly been getting ruined instead of the original colors it had.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fucking 1400-1500 for a one bedroom in FL. I’m stuck with my parents forever. I gotta get out of here the wages are so bad. Nurses here are literal shit to Florida

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: they're waiting to sell to Blackrock or some shit
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Saw a house that started at 300k... nearly two years ago. It stayed at 300k. Three different buyers started on it, and then stopped the process of buying it. By the time it went off the market, it had dropped to... 275k  Utterly insane that they kept it that high with... guess what? A cracked foundatioN!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: A lot of positions offer relocation assistance.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Shitty little suburban homes where I live are now around the million mark, can't have shit.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If rents dont go down first, housing will never follow.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same with apartments. They crunch numbers and decide it's more profitable to jack the rents up so high that half the units are empty. Profit is evil. Profit is destroying humanity. I'm sick of this horrible system that elevates greedy b*stards.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Ella-g2m tell me you dont understand supply and demand without telling me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Minimum wage would have to be $79/h in order to buy a house reasonably like when the $7/h was implemented. It’s genuinely insane.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Would you prefer a tarp tent shelter outside or an actual house as shelter to live in?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You know you dont have to buy a 400k starter home right?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @HouseHoldAdventures that’s what they cost now my guy. A cardboard box on the side of the road starts at a reasonable 200,000 now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: On the other hand, you don’t need to live anywhere in particular.  In the past, you couldn’t afford to live near work, so you had to drive a lot.  Now you can live where you can afford and work from there. Fair trade off.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @laurentiusXI  my man thinks all jobs are remote while im out here busting my A. Its not fair, get over yourself

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @marcinsco.  I got the lowest level misdemeanor, and it got stayed which means it will not be on my record as of this December. I cannot get a job at a big company because with even a parking ticket you will get denied. I had to work for my dad, and I make more an hour than most people right before retirement. I make 140 an hour and the job is hard but the money is good. You really just need your dad as the owner or CEO.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That happened to me like a decade ago. I applied for a job with the city of Los Angeles. I heard back the year later, but by then I was living abroad 🤣
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @CNHFTC2010 How did you get a job abroad?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It was worse for me. I got decline emails from companies I applied to 2 years ago and after I held 2 different jobs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I lost my job in November 2023, applied for tons of Jobs immediately, didn't hear back from any of them until March when I starter interviewing for the job I have now which i have now (hiring process took until June) in July and August I heard back from multiple jobs I applied for back in November asking if I wanted to interview. Biazzare times we live in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got a call back a year later for a job at a fast food place…like what?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You also probably only applied to 1 job.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just got a call back two weeks ago for an entry level minimum wage job I applied to at least 4 months ago
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I applied for an internship in October 2020 right after graduating. I received an answer in July 2024! Not only that but they had the audacity to request that I come in for an interview by the end of THAT WEEK. It was Wednesday.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That was pre AI when slow humans were still allowed to have jobs
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah with rent prices the way they are and food prices the way they are what job is even going to be able to afford a zoomer a good quality of life?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @savior_protector1721 not even closed based on everyone’s estimates. Their wage would literally only cover rent OR food. (With maybe a little to spare but def not enough for the other one)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 24 is so young. And it doesn't matter if you live with your mom forever because the ECONOMY is broken, not you. You're doing the best you can ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a bit younger than you, haven't found a job yet despite trying 😮‍💨 ik how you feel
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is normal now. Let the system get even more broken so that we literally just have to point at it and know who’s to blame. The answer is it’s the companies that did this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @dblackout1107 nah. It’s always going to be "the people don’t want to work more!" That’s gonna be blamed.   Those companies own the news, they have them say whatever benefits them. Don’t be fooled. There will always be enough idiots to believe it. Because "they" are the "only good ones" left. At least in their minds.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No shame. That's just how it is these days. Nothing wrong with living with family as long as you're putting in the effort to contribute and not taking advantage of them. In most societies it's the norm.   This fixation on moving out to get a house and a family on your own in your 20s are just boomer standards. Job market was good and expenses were cheaper back then. Not so much now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m in the exact same situation as you! About to be 24 and if I wasn’t living at my university I would be having a hard time moving out of my mother’s home too. Literally living on paycheck to paycheck to afford rent. I also feel so stressed out that I can’t be fully independent but at least we’re not going through this alone. Hope you find something in the near future! 🙏
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m in the exact same situation, same age as well, recent college graduate. We’re all in this together.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 29 and just moved back out. Have a finance degree, no college debt. Struggling immensely. There’s more like us
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ha.  I'm 36 with a mechanical engineering degree.  Literally working like 4 hours a week....  I feel your pain
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Are u srs. Get out of your brainwashed state. Independence in the way that you are thinking is not natural nor feasible (especially in todays economy oBviOuSLy). There's nothing wrong with staying with your family, society has convinced us to move out and be separate in another house hold, just giving them more money in the long run.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have a cooperate job and I still can’t afford to move out. Rent is ridiculous - thought it might be smarter to just wait and get enough money for a house. Boyfriend and I have been saving up to buy a condo, and they didn’t approved our combined salary for mortgage. We are both 24 yrs olds working as engineers😂 Toronto is just ridiculous, I don’t even see us getting married and have a kid at this point
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 24 and being at home is normal.  30 and being at home is now about to be normal too.  And guess what a large family home was how everyone USE to live
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: good corporate jobs are a unicorn.   find a decent blue collar job. yeah it might be hard but there's a lot of jobs that will pay like 30-35 an hour in basically entry level positions.   fiber splicers, equipment operators, specialized assembly jobs...  it can be scary going into new things like that but I promise it's a lot more accommodating than you think and you'll feel much better about yourself being able to get onto your feet.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey, I’m 23 and in the exact same situation. Believe me, you are NOT alone ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just turned 25 like 2 weeks ago, and I'm in the exact same position as you are. It's so embarrassing to struggle in finding a job istg..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: truck driving might be an option?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @JoshuaDiGiacoma hell no shoot me if I have to resort to being a truck driver. I can’t stand road-trips I couldn’t imagine doing that for my living no thank you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 26 and still struggling DESPITE being employed. Minimum wage and shortchanging of hours is killing us 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm in the same exact boat as you and I'm 31.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No such thing as being a failure, just keep pushing, i got lucky meeting the right person at the right time and got a good job in the oilfield, though i probably could have gotten a job in the oilfield anyway.   It seems unlikely or fruitless but if you just keep working hard and meeting new people eventually things will fall into place. Just trust yourself and what you want, and the biggest advice i can give you is find something to take up your time that makes you feel healthier mentally or physically, preferably something thats free if you’re looking for a job still. Do mot fall into the socially constructed trap of feeling like because you havent met some arbitrary goal or expectations that you are a failure. 2 steps forward 1 step back is still a win.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Juniorthepuppymaker you’re only truly failing if you quit
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: try being in the same position at 28!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Youre not alone, and some of us are 30+ and in the same boat. Don't be too hard on yourself esp if youre making an honest effort. What's meant to be will come. Hang in there ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im 28 and just moved back in 💀 there are literally no apartments or houses in my area i can afford.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey don't worry, I'm 26, moved out when I was 18, Bounced around careers not knowing what I wanted to do. I also have nothing! :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Focus more on what you enjoy and let the rest sort itself out. Your life is yours to make, disregard what others make you feel like you should do
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 24 - we're young. +10years that will be worst but STILL it depends on the situation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 21 and I feel the same honestlyyy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 23, exact same situation. I don’t even have money to buy anything, and I am nearing the end of my savings. I can’t find any job. 16K in debt with 2 degrees. I will be bankrupt before I can even get my first real job.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1. It's common for this to be the solution during recession 2. The expectations society has are completely outmoded since LLMs, maybe even social media. 3. Many cultures around the world have multi-generational homes. Inter-generational relationships are good support systems (highly dependent on how shitty your family members are). The amount of time I spent at grandma's house as a child is proof of concept: The single nuclear family model simply doesn't have enough hands to support a household.  Something's got to give.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Don’t worry you’ll be in this state for another 10 years
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 27 going 30 at this rate 😭😭 Need to save at least 2 years to just get an apartment 😵‍💫
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 24? Most people don’t start feeling comfortable and on their feet til they’re in their 30s. I should know. I’m 31. I’ve JUST started feeling some sense of security til I recently got laid-off due to “lack of demand”.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You are 24 years old. You choose to feel like a failure for not conforming to some artificial and strange societal pressures.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 25 and I have a corporate job with above minimal pay in my country and still can't really move out or I'd live from paycheck to paycheck lol.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: same boat :/ and it's also mental health vs saving money </3
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m in the exact same situation girl it sucks
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thaaaat's exactly my current situation, it's so tiring to keep fighting the blame i put upon myself. Just know it will be better
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We’re all in this together haha 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You have to know someone to get a good job these days. Thats literally it. Its basically nepotism but with friends. I was in the exact same situation as you earlier this year when I was 24 but I had a friend who was able to get me a reference to this entry level corporate job in finance and somehow I got the position and for the first time in my entire life I have a career opportunity at this massive company starting out making 50k a year. If you were to ask me 6 months ago id say the same thing as you. Ask your friends who have good jobs if they can hook you up with a reference to somewhere. It seems like thats the only way now, you NEED connections.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 99% of world gen z the same wuth your struglls - just to let you in that you are not alone and no matter where are you from - we are cursed gen
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 24 is still very young tho … y’all just go travel and live life as long as you still can, as long as you’re still young and not tied down by a corporate job and responsibilities  Btw in Europe it’s completely normal to still go to university at 24 or even older till like your 30‘s and most people in their 20’s I know live with roommates in an apartment or live with their parents / silbling, like I don’t know anyone at your age who lives completely alone and who pays rent for a home completely alone, so here in Europe you definitely wouldn’t be considered failing for living like this. I feel like especially the US has this schedule that everyone goes to college straight after high school (here in Europe many take a gap year/years and travel or something) and then you choose a major that you’re gonna study the next three years or so and that you cant change cause you can't pay the high tuition to go to College for more years (in Europe it’s completely normal to change you major after time or to study something different after you’ve finished your first degree since you don’t need to pay nearly as much as in the US for college, so you’ll find much older people in Universities than in the US) and then at like 21/22 y’all are finished with college and are supposed to now get a full time job and work towards that americam dream of a house with a white picket fence. Which is why at 24 you already feel old and behind in live with not having a job and not being able to afford a home by yourself even though you’re still very young. This is mostly the American mindset.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The country is failing you along with millions of other people. It’s not your fault twin 😀👍
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bruh I’m 22 live on my own with gf and still feel like I’m failing. One emergency away from pay check to pay check, savings is barely holding on, debt collectors keep calling. Career good but my schedule 8 hours a day turns into 12 hour day with commute. But I only get paid for 8. Have less energy for hobbies, things are not fun.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey, I don't mean to be rude or disrespectful, but have you ever thought of joining the military?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Think more about being self-employed. Side hustles.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Recession/Depression indicators are based on the stock market. Or in other words, how well those at the very tippy top are doing.  So, technically speaking we are "not in a recession" because the 1% is taking all of our fucking money.  And then using it to fund a genocide of fucking course!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @GanglyQueen  instead of writing all that just to be wrong you could've just fkn googled. have more copium
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly… we’ve been in one since 2020!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For the top 20% they are in boom times  Don't confuse differences between those who own assets and those who rent from them
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The video maker doesn't seem to understand that a section of the population are being put into permanent underclass.... They are surplus to requirements because automation and AI will take over. You don't need people when AI and automated bots become consumers themselves
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We've been in one for 4 years now
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You know this is all by design, right….
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We’ve been in a recession for 5 years now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We are not currently in one...we've been in one since 2020
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We are not in a recession. It happens when the market crashes. We're just peaking into one
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Good point. It's not like the Trump Regime would let them tell us if we're in a recession. It was bad enough under Biden without the insane chaos that hurts the economy, the tariffs, letting companies get away with anything as long as they bend the knee. It's gonna be bad until we join together and stop letting them control us
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We're in another great depression.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not trying to make people panic, but we've been in a recession since Covid 19 lockdowns started.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: God damn people are so confidently wrong in these comments. Recessions are based on gdp decline over two quarters, depressions are ambiguous but there has been no American depression since the 30s. God, how can you guys just speak out of your asses and not want to learn
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We've been in a depression since Covid occurred. This isn't new. Glad to see everyone finally coming around to it now that the administration is posting accurate and real data rather than the fake data the Demonrats were pumping out for four years.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @introspectivevelociraptor8274  it's frustrating hearing trump saying we're the hottest nation in the world and that we're getting incredibly rich. It won't trickle down to normal people for years if at all. But at least it's income for the federal government rather than squeezing taxpayers dry for every cent. Both administrations have their criticism. But Democrats did cause this and then lied at least Trump is just exaggerating
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Worse, we’re in a depression. Our money is literally worth less in the current economy than money was during the Great Depression. Look it up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “You couldn’t afford me anyway” is gonna be my new rejection response to every corporate email
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It is even worse if you are disabled. I have gone to interviews and they tell me to my face I can't handle the job in spite of them not being in the position to decide if I'm healthy enough. Everyone wants someone with an invisible disability, inclusivity is bullshit.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I love not getting hired and getting spam calls every damn day. Love the fact that I have no idea where my info ends up, but if I want to submit an application, I have to agree with their terms and conditions. My main email account has been targeted for phishing and there's people trying to break in every 5 minutes. I love it so much
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I applied for McDonald's twice, got an interview both times, and got rejected both times, and I also applied for and got rejected by Little Caesars, Firehouse Subs, Taco Bell, and every fast food place in the area. I applied to Walmart, waited a couple months, got an interview after inventory, got immediately hired part-time (which was a surprise), and now I'm lucky if I work 3 days a week and even more lucky if I work an 8 hour shift.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Great video. People in their 30s and 40s are struggling to find a job too, with some applying for entry level work making it even harder for gen Z to find a job. Makes me wonder if all the mid level stuff has been cut and now they just have entry level people do everything with no upward opportunities.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Applied to 600 internships (still in college) with tailored resumes. Got two interviews. No call backs. Ended up just taking summer classes. I dread the job search  EDIT: Not sure why people are telling me to “do more” or that my resume is lacking. I assure you it is not lacking and I am doing the best I can.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly, it irritates me that companies get to do everything with AI while we get to jump through fire hoops just to get an interview and then get dumped nonchalantly.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The job search has people feeling like complete failures when really we failed in one way…letting corporations do this to us. They forget we outnumber them, and soon the saturation of people living in cars with no family and no home is going to get scary for everyone.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The fact that people are now turning to magic to get a job says a lot about this job market
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was judgemental of OF but now that I hear this... I get it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It is CRIMINAL that I got an indeed ad right before indeed was mentioned
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The big question out of all of this is “what the fuck are we supposed to do and where does this lead?” Because I have absolutely no clue how to even plan for the future if this is life
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: BTW if an employer asks you to come in early or stay late, or do anything outside of your scheduled hours and you just don’t want to do it for any reason, just say “Sorry I have prior commitments during that time”. Don’t tell them you have a workout class or that you just don’t want to, you could be taking care of a sibling, parent, or grandparent, for all they know.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Worked at Exxon, the manager put everyone on salary, even after their paper says hourly. Then fired two for being related, and took hours from me, and fired me when I told her it’s illegal. She hired an older man at 8 an hour, and he had a heart attack at work because of her. She’s behind bars now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i think the main issue no one is talking about is that many workplaces are just straight up lying. they post jobs they have 0 intentions of ever filling and force their severely understaffed workforce to pick up the slack. like there is zero labour shortage, the labour shortage is a hoax that allows them to get away with dogshit service because well, no one wants to work anymore :(
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 10:16 “nooo you hung up first” aah conversation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ve definitely done the ‘Gen Z Stare’ but in my defense the customer had asked me why one of our menu items had condensed milk on it  Not why her food had condensed milk on it, mind you. She was reading off the menu. And wanted to know why a dessert had a sweet topping. A year later I still don’t know how to answer that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Most places don't even bother telling you that you're rejected.  So glad I'm no longer in the job market as I am retired. But, I may need a PT job in the near future if prices continue to rise.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a middle Millennial (1991), and I honestly really identify with Gen Z and their presentation when it comes to work culture. The type of bullshit the average modern worker is expected to put up with is significantly higher than past generations. This whole "fast paced, high-tension workplace" garbage is just code for "we want to exploit you and we expect you to smile and thank us for the opportunity" and we all know it. It's normal not to want to put yourself into a situation where you're treated like that, and all these influencers acting like Gen Z is lazy, entitled, and unmotivated are both correct and misguided in their sense that it's somehow morally wrong. If the system is set up to abuse you anyway, it's a perfectly reasonable reaction to be fed up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Every other generation: "I just don't want my kids to struggle the way I had to." Then the Boomers: "Kids today have it too easy!" Proceeds to slam to door shut on every cultural/economic advancement for the past 100 years on the way out.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nope they don’t actually want anyone with any type of disability unless they are externally audited.99% of jobs don’t want anyone disabled it’s not worth it to them
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@bladerubberexactly. The government tries to reimburse the employer for employing a disabled worker, but even with these benefits they would rather have a fully healthy worker
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @bladerubbermake no sense I got CP
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: lol jobs do NOT want someone with an invisible disability. People with autism or other neurodivergency have extremely high unemployment rates because if you seem even kind of awkward in an interview they'll instantly disregard you regardless of how experienced you are or your answers to the questions. Most employers just want robots who will do what they say with no questions or accommodations needed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @havenmashups5081  that’s what happened to me a couple months ago
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nah, im invisibly disabled and they just go "why cant you handle it idiot" then stop giving me hours even though I TELL THEM WHEN THEY HIRE ME
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @UnleashedRevolver disabled is disabled, in the EU or at least in germany you get a document with specific disability grades n thats all. But anyways here disabilities are not restricted, it does not have to be physical
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People treat disability like you are lazy, abusing the system. All I get is 960$ per month, they cut my food stamps to 100$. By the time I pay insurance, phone, rent, gas etc. I have 300 for 4 weeks. It’s insane.  I been on crutches almost 5 years and my leg has grown 4 inches shorter because of muscle contraction. It’s so fucked yall.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@dr.antonenewcombe9592  I'm sorry to hear that, it is tough. I completely agree that disability is treated as a choice, I've been told many times that I shouldn't give up (whatever that means).. that I need to try harder. I would love to see them fully recover with 6×6cm less brain matter
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As somone with an "invisible" disability... uh no, they don't want us either lmaoo
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Then better go to germany, here people are forced to have a specific amount of disabled and you will be preffered actually over non disabled people, to an extent that if you and a non disabled person are hired, the chance of them getting the position after the 6 month trial period is low bc you are there.  so yeah, germany is def ur place. Also after ur “probezeit” ur basically un-fireable. Literally.  PS i know bc my dad is considered as disabled bc he had cancer and now the company he works for has to keep him no matter if he even shows up or not bc due to the disability ID he is prioritized. And he does many questionable things. But they have to deal with it no matter what 🤣 and also he has a gov job so he is like so save he could commit arson at this point without consequences.  Thats so far how i have experience the job market here
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @sarapeyton4335  well who has money to move to Germany? Lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Even an invisible disability isn't better. People decide whether they like you or not within seconds of meeting you. For neurodivergent people, especially autistic people, that means they are f'ed from the beginning and nothing they can do or say after will change the mind of that pompous interviewer.   The federal govt used to hire a lot of disabled and ND people and now they all lost their jobs thanks to dumptruck.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Invisible disability is equally bad. They just assume you're equally capable as a non-disabled person, and when you don't live up to expectations you're treated like a living failure.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Shit, I’m 27 and was disabled at 23. I haven’t walked in almost 5 years. My right leg is stuck straight since 21’ because the hospital said I was fine when I actually had a hip fracture. Now I have NO HIP and cannot find a specialist to take me out of state bc NV doesn’t have one. I couldn’t even find legal help to take my case and now the time frame is past. It’s so fucked. Now I live w my folks (bad environment) and my mom has to put my socks and shoe on, help me get in the tub etc. I get 960 per month, my folks make me pay them even though they get caretaker $. Had to give them half my back pay. Backpay doesn’t come all at once, I got 2k three times and they make you wait six months per payment. So fucked, I had to get a 2k car that’s always costing $. Had I gotten my pay I could’ve gotten a more reliable vehicle.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah.. I’ve got one of those and I gotta tell you the invisible disability isn’t much better..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My boss literally told me im no longer allowed to go to the bathroom on clock. I told her why I can't because of my disabilities and gave her the paperwork too she was kind enough 😒 to allow me graciously to use the bathroom once per my 10 hour shifts while on clock
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Skoomasipper how dare you use the bathroom the audacity 👀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Skoomasipper Sounds highly illegal
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wrong I look completely healthy on the outside and they said "I dont need a diversity hire" directly to my face
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i had to stop marking my applications with "i am disabled" (i have a couple mental disabilities) because i was not getting any interviews. the second I stopped doing that I suddenly get five interviews, none of them went anywhere though :/
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @dreamofthe_wild I’ve been thinking of doing that too. Because on the one hand, I have nothing to hide, but on the other hand, if I DO disclose that I have a disability, I’ll get discriminated even though it’s literally illegal. It’s crazy how common and normalized this is.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @dreamofthe_wild yeah it’s wild, I started doing the same and started seeing more interviews, maybe all the equal chance employers are worried about getting sued so they feel the need to book the interview at least when someone has a disability
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THIS!!! I've been struggling to find a job for almost two years now due to my health, but also due to the fact that it's SO HARD to get a job when you're disabled. I'm very limited to what I can do now, and the jobs that I CAN do require a degree. Disability doesn't even pay enough to get by. I've been in poverty for as long as I can remember. I'm so sick of living like this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes happened to me because they don’t want disabled people.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: where i live, a lot of companies actually try to get a percentage of employees to be either native/disabled/or veterans
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Weird it’s completely the opposite where I’m at, I was even noticing that some heavily social jobs I applied for like cashier, grocery bagger, McDonald’s, all hired autistic employees. I didn’t even get an interview until I marked I was disabled which I hadn’t been before fearing it would affect my chances of being hired.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If ur disabled y would u want to work?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @jayaCatLvr-ys5ix  what do you mean? Are we meant to stay home and do nothing for the rest of our lives so we don't get in the way of the abled people? How can you feel fulfilled then? What if what we get for disability isn't enough to live off of? I don't have a husband to take care of me, I am the one taking care of everyone. If my only job was to be a parent I wouldn't last long, I need more purpose, we have the same needs as everyone else in life
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m autistic and my inability to make eye contact or speak properly ruined my chance immediately even though I’m probably better at the job than anyone else there
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s gonna be even worse with DEI getting ripped apart, thanks to epsteins best friend.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It hard I started job hunting at 19 after finishing school didn't get a job till 28 almost 29 and even then just 2 days . 8 have autism and just got lucky I suppose that they want to take on a disability person. There is still some hope out there for you .I been in job for just over 2 years and everything great
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Absolutely real, it's awful. I'm in Australia and I'm permanently disabled, however I have to apply to jobs and work 25hrs a week to be paid for "disability", even though I struggle to walk and stand. Trying to apply is awful (even through disability providers, they don't care either), I've only gotten 1 interview in over 100+ applications. If I somehow get more interviews, I know they won't want me as soon as I say I'm disabled lmao, it's a never-ending loop.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Everytime I've showed symptoms of my mental illnesses, ive gotten fired lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fuck bro literally this, getting spam calls just because you did an obligatory  application XD
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ve been targeted by spam texts trying to kidnap me with a modeling job that will “pay $250-300 an hour”. Likely trying to harvest my organs or sell me as a slave. I love America! 😊
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The land of freedom, freedom for criminals I guess😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: oh lord its wonderful , good luck be honest
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I applied to Walmart, it took them a long time to respond to me they called me and asked if I could do a 10hr shift 7 days a week!! I have a life as well!!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Brayden-h6h  well it aint that bad.. i'll take that if its near my home
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The people who started their 30s (when the outbreak happened 24-26) recently have been trying to find those entry level jobs when the outbreak started (and even before that). Some might have been lucky getting jobs from other fields or low paying places, but there’s a lot of people who never got them and are still searching.   A lot from this age group were still studying or just gradueted when the orona happened. Some needed to study longer because they could not graduate because classes were in hold or did not get their intern/traineer jobs to fill their studies. And then it was impossible to get a job right after getting the papers.   And this was hard even before the outbreak. We were just blamed to be lazy and we did not have statistics and gen z calling this out. 😂 The whole last 10 years has been the same for the people in their early 30s and late 20s.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is me. I have 15 yrs of experience in my field. I’m 33. I just started a job this week after being laid off from my last one, and it pays minimum wage and is entry level. I want to move up, and I have in the past, but then I get laid off or the company goes under and I have to start over again. It’s horrible.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @roxycocksey  YUP! I worked for nine months at a small dry cleaners and laundromat. Got two raises totaling $3/hr (from 14 to 17, whoopdiedoo!) and was in junior level management, only to be laid off so they could replace me with a 17 year old they were paying $13/hr too. It's not even worth the risk to try and get paid what you're worth these days, cuz suddenly they'll just go "oops, can't 'afford' you anymore".
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @roxycocksey  I feel that. I've been "entry level" for almost a decade. Ooooh but I don't have the qualifications for the next step up so I'm just trapped here forever. Even though that next step up used to hire fresh out of college. Then new hires can't get these jobs because I'm applying to them with 5+ years experience because I can't get anything better. And they tell us we have a "birth rate crisis" when we can't provide a decent life for the people who are already here.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Which is even more demoralising since 30-40 is the ideal age group for employers to hire. If the most desired people in the market can only get entry level positions then what about us 💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am my job right now looking for ways to trim middle management 💀  I gotta map the whole department to determine which of the big honchos aren't needed
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm getting a job in healthcare and my instructor lost her job in the pandemic (a job she spent years getting a bachelor's to be able to do) shes at least in her early sixties and had to restart her career 5 years ago and go into a completely new industry.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: why would they promote anyone when they could just hire the ceo’s dipshit kid to be the next upper manager? peasants have been getting too confident with their ability to make a life for themselves smh. know your place, money only belongs to a select group of people and you only get just enough to give everything back to the richies /s
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bro they're gonna hire 50 zoomers before hiring ONE Gen x or older millennial
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm unsure whether this reflects generational differences or the current job market conditions. As an older job seeker, I sent out hundreds of CVs and received only two interview invitations.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: that’s not it, it’s that nobody is retiring anymore, everything’s too expensive, so even the ppl who are retired need to keep working, which trickles down
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is in-fact what they’re doing by requiring entry level jobs to have an mba or a Bach with x cert and 5+ years of experience, they cut out the middle bridging gap, seniors and execs get hired from different pools and by different recruiting agencies while entry level is more of a mill to grind work out of people until they reach the 8 month mark. It’s also why people are sometimes labelled as independent contractors for a period of months.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I had to drop down, as a 33 year old at the time, to working as a 3/4 full time closing pizza delivery driver. Turns out it makes good money, but any notion of there being a career to work your way into nowadays is completely dead. Capitalism is dying and we're absolutely free falling into this century's great depression. It's a fucking crisis out here but the government keeps trying to tell us that the economy has "never been greater" cuz the nonsensical DOW Jones lives in an entirely different dimension.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was making 93k this time last year. No I make $16.50 and don't have insurance. I had to move to another state after losing my apartment. I got laid off a few months prior. Anywho, I've been looking for a job in my field by have found anything. I apply everywhere. Even the shitty companies: CVS Walgreens Walmart aldis lidl.... nothing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: they are definitely making entry level people do higher level work. my boyfriend is an unpaid intern for an investment bank and they’re making him work 40+ hours a week while he’s a full time university student. he’s telling me he’s doing the same work and higher than the actual hired people on his team.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Depends on where you are, my city has a bunch of older people cause it’s Florida :/ taking over the jobs so when I was younger there were no jobs for teens/young adults. They were all older people. Except the fast food restaurants
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Mianna. I think I’m probably speaking from a perspective of privilege regarding corporate jobs in big cities, my bad, but yea each region and industry has their own context
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That’s irrelevant.  There’s no age limit for most jobs. Who cares.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How come Gen Z is too lazy to learn a trade?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @jamess359  Ah yes we went from "learn to code" to "learn a trade."  Boomers wanting cheap labor to maximize profit? Shocker
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jamess359  34% of gen z with a bachelors degree are currently working blue collar jobs, while up to 72% of gen z college graduates are considering a skilled trade career. We are being referred to as the ‘tool-belt generation.’ You’re throwing around hateful speech and perpetuating the idea that this generation is lazy without looking at the statistics right under your nose.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, you guys are taking the jobs that’s supposed to be there for us. Because yall didn’t save or put away for a real retirement. You had opportunities to change policies and laws and instead you didnt. Left the burden on us yet you had a head start.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Astr0nWilllowWxrld  people don't retire in their 30s and 40s genius. Gaining literacy and critical thinking will help you a lot.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Astr0nWilllowWxrld  Are you talking about 30-40 somethings? They couldn't save shit my dude the jobs pay poverty wages and rent is $2000 a month. They got f'ed just like you, they've just been getting f'ed longer. 2008 wiped them out then the economy has been hell ever since, they never had a chance.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @Astr0nWilllowWxrld  Most of these people never got these entry jobs when they started searching them and never got the job or change to save up. Escpecially the people in their early 30s since the outbreak happened right when they were finishing their studies or just started to try to get their first big boy/girls jobs. They have been in the line way longer than you have been. The economy was bad even before the outbreak and people have been on that line wayy longer the outbreak happened. It really did not change anything except people have recently started to understand that maybe it’s not these people’s fault that they don’t get jobs. In some places unemployment rates were even worse 10 years ago.   They don’t have retirements or any money saved up because they did not get the jobs or have been working as part-timer with a bad mininum wage from what you’re not going to save anything.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The easy answer is to blame the person suffering. We do this a lot in society because we don't want collective responsibility when things are unfair and crappy.  People also don't want to admit that it is luck when they win the game that they didn't even know the rules of. They have to assume others were smart enough or worked hard enough or both to justify it not being luck.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Clanker is basically what people are calling AI. Because they suck so it is hate. It’s a slur in starwars because they called droids clankers as a hate term. You are right there are a bunch of ghost jobs out there. Many are in hiring freeze and laying off this year. Trying to downsize even as projects ramp up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @spaghettisauce445 I hope it isn’t CS…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This was me for 3 years of my finance degree. I just started working for myself in property management this summer.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Keep going! My boyfriend applied to hundreds and eventually got some. Don’t give up <3
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got turned down for some many UNPAID internships like what
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 600 internship applications and only two interviews (no call backs) is crazy. i'm so sorry. it's such a stupid cycle and i hope that we can all get out. i'm sure you're doing all you can, the hiring process is just an extra ring of hell
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m majoring in engineering but I’m also an apprentice for local 7 sheet metal in Michigan. Might be worth looking into some trade jobs sometimes they will hire helpers in the summer. It’s not like ideal if you aren’t doing a mechanical type degree but it’s work experience?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @connerSphotography  The problem with this is that the Job market for trades is now OVERSATURATED Trades are incredibly competitve rn, so no garentee you will get a job in even that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Not sure why people are telling me..." It's really quite simple. You're too polite. It's because blaming the people who are hurt by the system means they can live in denial about it being broken.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Oceanwaves-d8l You’re right about the second half. Easier to blame people and not the system.   As for the first part I’m not going to attack people in a yt comment section lmao, that’s so useless. Also, I don’t get how I’m “too polite” when all I did was make a comment that people were suddenly responding to telling me I’m not doing enough. That’s not the definition of “too polite” lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: why did you even waste time responding to them? they clearly did not read your comment, they clearly didn't read "Applied to 600 internships" before they wrote "do more" and they clearly didn't read "tailored resumes" when they wrote "resume is lacking". the only thing these people deserve is what I am not able to say on here.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Brother, this is something that should change but may never. But you gotta talk to your professors and your friends in class and go in person to engineering firms or whatever your major is. The job search in my industry has always been meeting the right guy. But more and more it’s becoming the reality that every field is becoming more about who you know than what you know. If all else fails the marines in America or the oilfield in canada can never take enough bodies.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hate to say it but it won’t be much better after graduation. I graduated May of 2024  with a bachelor’s in mechanical engineering and spent the summer putting out 600+ applications. I got 3 interviews and 2 job offers out of it. All I can say is good luck.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just finished my internship at an HRBP office of a retail operator..😭 about to do 798 more to get minimum wage after graduation, wish me luck
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I applied with tailored resumes and cover letters that were looked over by my college's career counselor to thousands of jobs over the course of a year and a half, all while being unemployed. I got maybe a dozen responses for interviews and got no replies afterwards. I did all the right things and were applying to simple jobs like medical record sorter and janitor despite having a bachelor's degree.  After being the most dangerously depressed I've ever been in my life, I gave up and went back to an entry-level part time job at the library, went back to food service. I now have 4 different part time jobs because that's all I can get. It's hell out here, and I know some people are saying you aren't doing enough, but as someone who was in your shoes, don't let it get to you. It's not you that isn't good enough, it's the system.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah but the 600 internships might be looking for something you dont have. Did you read what the 600 internships require? A good strategy that worked for me was to go for quality over quantity. I research a very specific internship and cater my resume for it, it might take time but I have better chances of getting the internship. And then I carer my resume for the next. I Applied to 23 internships and got 1!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Stilipluth  How long ago did this solution work for you?  I also find it hilarious that out of SIX HUNDRED different applications NONE of them came back, and you're so convinced it's somehow an issue on the person making the application. Do you know how large SIX HUNDRED is??? The average human can't even imagine ONE hundred different things. Try six. Insane.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Stilipluth  carefully curating my resume for mcdonalds only to get rejected by a clanker.  The issue is these companies aren't hiring they just have the position open on paper , all the applications go to ai which is instructed to auto reject everything. Job is a lottery now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its hard for me to believe this, I work as a College and Career counselor and I see my students get internships all the time. Make sure you visit your school career center to make sure your resume and application is up to par. 600 applications and only 2 interviews makes me think your resume needs help
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @JJ-me4yu  you live in a out of touch bubble

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Don’t forget u need to pay for job searching programs
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We need to wake up fr.  The fact that these small cooperations are hoarding wealth and dictating who they give Pennies too. Yet we are worried about race and gender pronouns. Ugh
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey don’t worry, they are at least working on the "no family" part having banned any right to terminate and coming for birthcontrol next.   So it’s just going to get a whole lot more miserable! Yeahhhhiii.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I used a subliminal to get hired. It’s pretty bad out here 😂

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @NinjaEnigmanot all magic is evil
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No it just says a lot about the smoothbrains doing it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Makes it much more evil on their end. Raising us up like livestock watching us grow up from afar then buying backstage access from people when they’re 18 just turned.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: All the jobs I’ve gotten in the past and even now, has been through indeed, so….
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nothing and nowhere better. The companies did this and until the country enforces a new world of employment culture, these companies will be vermin.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have no idea what I want in the future, at all.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Save up long enough to live off grid and have a little farm
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @self_as_illusion me too. I just want to be self sustaining and away. I wish I lived in the tribal era.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this bc i dont even want to live this life. not that im sewerslidal, but i literally dont want to give up the majority of my one shot at living on earth being exploited so that one person at the top can experience the things that I wanted to experience in my life. i dont really plan for the future or have goals. most of my goals that make me feel excited and engaged with my life are directly tied to what i can accomplish in video games
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Theres nothing you can do outside of doing the best you can. Most of us dont have the power, money or influence to facilitate actual change. Focus on the the aspects of life you have some control in.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't think it matters tbh. If it's not in my contract, I'm not doing it, and I don't have to give a reason. Not in the business of doing favors for the company.  (This is from a UK perspective though, I don't know if you can get fired for that in the States)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Was she ever on the cover of Forbes lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In Croatia,EU, bosses like this ....one on every 4 😢
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am so sorry for their loss... Job is like honeypot
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And also with handouts from the government, because they, "can't find anyone UwU".
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: idk about the US but over here in the UK, companies get compensation from the govt if they can "prove" that they're searching for new employees. so we end up with hundreds of thousands of these things called 'ghost listings' which is essentially a job application that they never intend to hire for. and will get paid to leave up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Riverr_6 i spelled it llabour twice and you accuse me of being american 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No one talks about rampant cronyism/nepotism. Most companies that do that aren’t even family-run
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: lol a few weeks ago I was buying ice cream and as i was about to pay an older dude just walked up to the counter - not behind me and waiting for his turn, he just walks there and starts talking - asking the girls if the cone costs extra and sh like that because HE DOESN'T EAT ICE CREAM OR ANY SWEETS BUT HE HEARD ON THE RADIO THAT THE COST OF IC CREAM WENT UP AND HE CAME HERE TO ASK...like dude??? im 30 and dont even work there but i defo did the gen z stare
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @bglr564 that is UNREAL oh lordy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Once I had a customer ask if there was dairy in her butter cake dessert. The gen z stare wasn’t even a thing yet and I swear I did it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have customers get mad at me for asking questions that prevent them from doing something not allowed, then ask me "you think I didn't know that??" like ma'am I don't know you, for all I know you could be dumb as rocks. I HAVE to assume they're stupid because 30 percent of the customers I meet do things even dumber than I assume they could.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The gen z stare is made up, its just freezing up because we are new to the market and thinking on how to resolve.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @thelunewinters  as a gen z, it's not only that. some people genuinely have a fried brain because it can take over 15 seconds for them to even emote. at least stutter or something or give me a "let me think about that" before going silent and staring blankly at me. again, I too am gen z, and this IS a problem in some capacity. not saying you're wrong, but there genuinely are people that genuinely don't know how to use their face.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've done the stare as well. I work at a farm and a customer came and said, "wow, there is a whole farm here".
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: someone looked at their order ticket and it was like 40 or something. they look at the ticket and ask “is this number 40?” i had to stare for a second and just blow up
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think I would have just said that it’s sweetened condensed milk and it’s more like a creamy syrup or thick coffee creamer
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "because it adds a certain je ne sais quois mouthfeel, ma'am"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jamess359 don’t you have something better to be doing?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jamess359  No way, I hate using tools!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Most places can't, speaking from being on the other side of it.  They cheap out on HR staff numbers or cheap out on an ATS system to send out rejection emails for them. Also there is no KPI on replying to unsuccessful candidates.  Its impossible when you have other objectives and 200 applicants per position.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Canadish  Some places don't even have auto-reject systems though and will just have applications sit in their system. I once tried re-applying to a location I tried to apply to in the past with a better built resume and was told I couldn't apply due to my old application being in review.....
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'll be honest here.  Whenever I replied to someone saying they're not a fit for the job I posted, they would desperately keep trying to follow up with me and beg for another chance.  I get it,, but it's heartbreaking and I don't want to go through that 30 times a week
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: '85 Millenial here. I feel the same. I got out of the military in 2013 and recognized instantly exactly what he is talking about in this video. So weird how it's normalized and people will act like there is something wrong with you if you're not willing to lick corporate boot for crumbs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: literally, boomers had everything handed to them and with all their wealth and power they continue to want more and more. The worst people have it all.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @bad-pumpkins  boomers got a reason to get out in the market after graduating ..finding job was easy as overall living cost was easy so was  low penetration of profit seeking perspective of companies in every field.. there was no AI type shit  Computer came in place but still computers gave way more jobs than what AI is possibly giving
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Boomers must all retired in old ppls places now maybe worlds will move on. they keep talking about 90s and im tired.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The only way to get a job now is nepotism. Either get hired by your dad's rich friend, or your friend's rich dad.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 6:42 did this for a few places and once I submitted the applications via their websites I went in person to the exact store I applied for and they straight up told me they only kept the listings up to make it look like they were hiring and not ACTUALLY hiring
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: All but one of these jobs I’ve held is because a temp or employment agency hunted it down for me. The fake postings and job ghostings are absolutely abominable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The problem is, people don't see people as "people". There's no empathy. Everyone is a resource, a number, a product. And they're constantly trying to invest the least amount they can while extracting as much profit as possible, and if there's a "better option", ooop you're out the window. Let's bring back viewing your employees as humans again.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's not "Nobody wants to work" it's "Nobody wants to hire"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Elder millennial here, and I support GEN Z fully. They inherited an irreversible mess.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a millennial, i really think the diminishing return is a big part of the problem. Its easier to accept that life is just going to be hard work when you get a comfortable home out of it, and can rely on having healthcare and a comfortable future. When you see all of that stripping away in the matter of a decade, it can really change your work ethic. My first job paid me $8 an hour (this was just in 2013!), so we are in this middle ground of now being paid more than we ever have, but it just isnt even close to enough to keep up. I imagine now it can feel like "whats the point," because thats how my $8 an hour paycheck felt.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here and it is CRAZY to me how we have forgotten how it used to be us. Ten years ago we were calling the job market on its bs and being written off as lazy. Now we are doing the same to Gen z. What is wrong with us?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 17 year old here. After 1 year on the job hunt, over 100 applications sent, 50 rejection e-mails (the others i still haven't received a response for) and a total of 3 interviews, i finally got my first job 4 months ago, which I'm fairly confident I only got because i mentioned in the interview that my mum works for the same supermarket chain and my boss just to happened to be my mums old boss as well
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If I have a job interview and it's an AI, I'm signing out and will email the company to tell them to f*ck off. I didn't get a science PhD to be interviewed by some piece of software. Luckily I'm in the position to just stop taking part in this kind of abuse.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'd to remind everyone that gen z is the first generation to be born directly into the internet and social media heavy world. Gen z are the guinea pigs that will be studied to see the effects of all these modern things on someone's development.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: From a thirty-something: if you can land even the simplest entry-level job, hang onto that shit for dear life while you look for something better. The best time to look for a job is when you already have one, even if your current job is making you miserable. It is better to have some income and be miserable than broke and suicidal. Do not think yourself "above" any work or you will get literally nowhere. Any experience is more to add to your currently blank resume that, presently, will never be considered by any job you deem worth a damn. You have to start somewhere, sometime. Blue collar work is still work. And if you have a job, any job, be proud of it. You're better off than a lot of desperate people right now. Don't take it for granted.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My first job ever I was 15. My friend told me about a job she got as a busser, wanted me to work with her, and I was tired of being broke lol.  I literally walked off at her bus stop with her and went in the restaurant and immediately got to the owner. We talked, and I was working that Friday. I had that job till I graduated high school and went off to college and it was because of my experience there that it was easy for me to get a better paying job in my undergrad school cafeteria.   I have a job now, but that's only because I've had time to continuously build upon experiences gradually because I had a chance to learn to navigate opportunity and networking in a sane time when people were reasonable and personable, and willing to help you grow.  Now people barely want people anymore, let alone if they're qualified. And now they don't even bother to speak to you at all to say you aren't qualified so you can find ways to better yourself with intention.   I remember learning about it when I was in undergrad, but to this day the idea of being "overqualified" for a job baffles me. That's purely a scam lol.  Edit: For context I'm nearly 26 now, so I'm older gen Z

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here: We got a new Gen-Z hire and he absolutely shreds. Works harder than me cause he's not dead inside yet.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh my god, I remember applying to over 10 places a day, sometimes REPEATEDLY for the same ones. My mother assumed I was lazy and not actually trying to get a job which added onto the pressure.   Once I got one, we started getting lower pay (forgot what it’s called) and she suddenly said to “start applying to somewhere else” LIKE HELLO?? Hell no I will NOT after the bullshit you put me through for a whole year of finding ONE job.   I lost that job after 7 months, suicide attempted after so much happened the last month and also fear of my mother finding out how much of a failure I became. Safe to say I live alone now, trying to get a job even with my experience is STILL the same as before, pure nothing and rejection. Also I have shame seeing my old work after the attempt, like pure fear of them seeing me after all that so I won’t be getting references anytime soon until we work on that in my counseling. I just want to help my lover financially even while dealing with so much again, as he picked me up from rock bottom once I was kicked out. Yet I can’t even do that with how shit the job market is. It genuinely mentally ruins you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I applied for a job in December 2024. Went for 2 interviews, the first in January 2025, and the second in February 2025, and finally got the rejection email in June 2025 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I met an old professor at a friend’s wedding who I had NO IDEA was even related to my friend. This was a God-given opportunity to reconnect and network. She asked what Id been up to and I said I had not pursued a job related to my degree (because there were none that would take me in 2021), but said that I was actively looking in related fields. Right before I was about to ask to keep in touch with her about potential networking, she interjected, “well you can always go for your PhD! I have classes starting at [university] this fall! Maybe I’ll see you there!”   Ma’am I get paid $45k a year work 50 hours a week and have a wife and child
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a millennial, I’ll say that millennials that are coming down hard on GenZ about prioritizing work over wellbeing are class traitors. Never put a corporation over your quality of life!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you’re trying to go a corporate route, sure. You youngins need to realize that there are different ways of making money OTHER than working for some bs corpo. I’d say go to your local college campus and find resources for you to earn real skills in life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thats the only reason i have a job right now. I got fired from McDonalds after they schedueled me on days that i asked off because they "lost" my request form
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How the hell did those dads get jobs in the first place? If most jobs are acquired via nepotism, how did the networking chain begin? Someone had to drop a resume so they could work and befriend people to use them.  Edit: fixed grammar
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @nucleartaco04  Do you know what the word "now" means?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @nucleartaco04 bros just figuring  out now that the rich get richer and the poor can only hope to get lucky
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @nucleartaco04  go back far enough, and someone started the company and brought all their friends along.  ...startups aren't ALL VC funding scams
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So how did I just get hired doing armed security? I got a call back after a few days and applied on Indeed. Most of you people are just applying to jobd that are over saturated with your useless degree
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @heyirock lol what are you 14? “I got a job, that means everyone else who doesn’t have a job is dumb and lazy.”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've been working for the same company for 8 years and I got the job through a temp agency (it was a temp-to-hire job). I wonder why more people don't use them
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @badvamp666  in my case it's because I looked at the postings outside and saw either a job a literal mole rat could do (like data entry or stocking shelves) for a miserable pay (and they STILL asked for prior experience)  or the most hyper-specific blue collar job imaginable (like aerospace welder). As such I never bothered to go inside and ask if they have anything that suits me. 💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @badvamp666  That's because the temp agency is taking 50% of the pay the company is putting out for you, not giving you holiday pay or benefits, and only offers the worst jobs. No job that people want to work needs to use a recruiting firm. These jobs churn and burn people. It's a body market.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How do you find a reputable employment company?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Will not happen because being an "adult" means only thinking within the capitalist system which functions like a cancer
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @DioBrando-n1i   I think it’s funny you blame capitalism like the poor being exploited by the rich is some new concept that only exists because of the free market 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: AI does not view humans as humans ... 🙂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's a lot more of "noboy wants to hire when they can understaff and pay for less workers that have insane workloads they haven't laid off in favour of the LLM bubble" They will sooner hire 1 person to do the work of 4 people while paying them jack shit as long as they can get away with it. There SHOULD be enough jobs on the market with how much society has grown and the amount of resources we churn through daily, yet wages and position openings are stagnant.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @calamity6942 I said that in my head before I opened the replies lmao (thanks for the support Foscel)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly, this is the problem with almost everything today, no incentive, with jobs relationships, college. People wouldn’t have an issue if the results were worth the effort. People keep saying “just try harder “ “just give more” more for what?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is my problem. When I had 2 jobs, a car, and multiple vacations a year, I didnt mind krilling myself at work. Now to know that I physically can not make enough money to ever do that again, I dont care. Im not obligated to be verbally abused at a job for 13/hr just because it sounds cute or the void needs filled, when it was for my survival, I cared so much more. Now I'm just bitter 😔
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My first job in 2019 paid $7.25. My second job was waitressing so I got paid off tips and barely made anything. My third job in 2021 I made $7.25. Fourth job (which took all of my sanity, never work for fast food) was paid $13. Then I got a better job but was paid $10. My current job I get paid $10. My brother’s last (full-time) job paid $11. The amount we’re getting paid isn’t going up but the cost of everything has tripled, at least….The average income for my area for a full-time job is $30,000 a year before taxes, which is not enough to live on for $1200 rent minimum after taxes.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I appreciate and respect you noticing history repeating itself
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My (millennial) parents (boomers) told me to literally walk into places to apply in person. No fucking clue or interest in understanding
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @BraneWyrms this! I can’t work a job due to my schedules stuff happening but my grandparents were like just go get a part time job. Just take a bunch of your resumes with you and apply in person. I tried explaining they refuse physical applications automatically and it can actually get you blacklisted because we “can’t listen to directions” and they just don’t want to see reality
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So ironic that in such a digitally connected age, only in-person connection seems to hold any weight anymore. Because those are the kinds of connections people aren't making anymore.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not that you didn't do a good job.. Getting a job at all is impressive and I'm proud of you. It just sucks that the job market seems to ONLY rely on luck and connections now, even for low level jobs. I wish you the best of luck at your job. You deserve it, mate. Keep up the good work <3
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @RannitheCat Shouldn’t low levels jobs be where connections are made? It’s weird and frustrating you need connections just to get a soul-draining minimum wage job catered towards high schoolers who need to have new-found work experience
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @RannitheCat  I just got my first job and my mother had a hand in it working out for me. She’s childhood friends with an HR lady in the government agency I applied for.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's basically connection, you it's never been your effort.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeh this is just sad that this state of affairs right now in america
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @spino1i people were giving away their children to farms in the Great Depression just so that they knew they’d get some meals every day. The worst part about how bad it is today, is that it has been even worse in the very recent past, and that it could reach that same point very very easily
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not fully true - i had this mindset and injured myself in a job with no safety standards, making my chances of finding jobs slimmer.  When the job is unsafe, minimal wage is not worth the hospital bills
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also young people entering factory/blue collar/ industrial work, don't break your body over doing it. Don't listen to supervisors telling you to ignore safety for more production. Especially if you use your hands. Tendonitis, carpal tunnel, shoulder issues suck
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: From a guy in his mid twenties, I agree. From my experience though a lot of people think themselves above a lot of different types of employment. I've seen it in many colleagues in student jobs, I worked in services (front of house in an opera) and a lot of younger guys and girls didn't even bother to pretend to be a good host in front of guests. Not looking out for elderly people that have trouble getting to their seat, not knowing where the toilets are, being downright rude. The works. These were all university students.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hard disagree. I didn't get job offers until AFTER I quit the job that was making miserable. I stopped looking for things that were below my paygrade and my education level. Granted, I have a master's so even if I made it to the interview round in retail, they would write me off as 'overqualified'. Granted, I got super lucky but narrowing my job search and learning to negotiate starting salaries was super helpful. I started getting results when I started focusing on what my skillset worked for. Again, this isn't for EVERYONE but if you have certain qualifications or degrees, stop applying for everything. It will only waste time and make you feel super frustrated.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "if you can land an entry level job" and what sucks is so many people can't
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Adding to your point as another 30: never quit without having another income lined up. That’s how people end up settling with exhausting, toxic and low-paid jobs (if they find any) and then it gets increasingly more difficult to apply elsewhere because they simply don’t have the time and energy to do so. Also be mindful of the ongoing job market, you might have a year worth of savings to live on but maybe you won’t find a job in the next year…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a 29yr old with substantial job experience, I second this persons comment. Do NOT leave your job then look for work. It’s the worst decision you’ll make
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah I've worked at my shitty fast food job for 2 years now but the job market is actually killing all of us
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This but also in my job search, I couldn’t even get Walmart or Amazon warehouses to answer me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeah this is a really prevalent problem that is not addressed enough. People vehemently resent the mcdonalds job but don't understand that it is still money while you're trying to get a better one. Not everybody can start at no experience 25+ hr nowadays, which sucks, but in the meantime money is better than no money.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hate my job rn it’s retail and pays 12 an hour but I have like 17-25 hours. I also go to school though. But I have a second job that’s 13 an hour but less hours like maybe 3 shifts a week. Do u think I should quit the one I hate or stick with it?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @pde8444 what are you going to school for?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For real when I was unemployed I could apply for the worst jobs and still not get anything. But with looming redundancies at my last job I was able to get hired at the first place I applied to.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: thank you I will take this as everyday remainder.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: sadly a lot of gen z really do believe certain jobs are below them, I hear about it and see it all the time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Got accepted and hired for 5 high end tech jobs in the last year. It’s the constant grind and commoditization of the things I love that are making me suicidal.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: From a 19 year old currently working a warehouse job, thank you, I needed to hear this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: maybe I worry too much as a little hatchling of an 18 year old. thank you still worrying a little though
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a 19 year old who started working as a busboy at the age of 16, I agree with this. It’s a miserable job, the minimum wage and tip is barely enough to keep up with today’s economy, but I’m still holding onto it. Not to mention, not only will you build up experience, you’ll eventually get connections that will help you move forward in life once you leave your entry-job. So this advice is very much true.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this is why im starting night shifts soon at a rat infested store as a stock assistant 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's the problem. People think blue collar work is beneath them. They don't realize that the SKILLED trades pay well everywhere except the south.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ChadsOfChristmasPasts  Skilled trades have their own certification standards which means more debt & willingness of others to train them. It is not the solution. The moment we flood the skilled trades with millions upon millions at once, the pay rates will drop will fast due to the competition & sheer numbers.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ChadsOfChristmasPasts Idk where this misconception is coming from. Where I am it’s very difficult to get an entry level apprenticeship position.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have computer science degree and my current job is being an Amazon delivery driver. I absolutely do think I am above my job because I shouldn't even be in this role in thie first place after college. The economy is truly in shambles and there really ins't jobs outside of healthcare and various service based jobs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @_nimrod92 no job isnt beneath you. Whatever you gotta do to get by  My brother in law used to be an amazon delivery driver. He doesnt have a college degree yet he got a job working at a tech start up, then got laid off. He then got a job at a company that did flight simulators, but left that to go back to his tech start up. All without a degree.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 34 and have had all kinds of different jobs in my life. If you have a sufficient amount of savings it's better to stay jobless for a few months for the sake of your sanity. Of course I'm talking from the perspective of a European
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: spoken like a true westerner lol. all of this was predicted almost 150 years ago and none of you decided to crack open capital and just take a read??
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @alexanderredhorse1297  this is a direct consequence of followers of Das Kapital getting control of our culture, opening our borders and destroying our families and societies
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​ @alexanderredhorse1297  exactly lol I'm from a third world country and "minimum wage" jobs are 48 hours per week for 150 dollars per month. That wouldn't even cover rent alone here let alone things like food transport ect
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @alexanderredhorse1297  lol chill, they’re going off their own experiences and just giving people advice. What would you rather have them do? say “idc if others screw themselves over even tho I could’ve given them advice & prevented that” and move on with their day? You’re really reprimanding a human for wanting to help others? A lot of the internet is filled with ppl like you always looking to start something.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We gotta invest our way out here system!!!!!! These JOBS PAY LIKE $HIT
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They want young uneducated people they can boss around and over work. If you are "overqualified", it probably means they think your standards are too high and are not willing to pay you what you deserve. When applying to lower level jobs be sure to omit your overqualifications
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @creepcraddle also to add more this is I don’t get why bosses or corporations can accept people wont work forever in your company   If they change jobs for better pay that means the economy is working and growing. But hey what do I know right
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​​ @creepcraddle I actually out of spite never did that 😂 If I paid for a degree that got me an internship or I had a great job I'm going to put on that piece of paper lol. Also, I absolutely hate updating my resume. I do it but I don't enjoy the process lol and I update my LinkedIn like once a year. I'm in grad school currently so I have the benefit of having a lot of professional connections around me too.   But I was still able to work at CVS and Walgreens and Burger King during the summers while I was in undergrad no issue. Easy low effort stocking/cashier/customer rep jobs. And I left after with my employers having nothing against me. They were happy I was in school and going back to college and encouraging me. I think that's the big difference now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Grew up being told by my parents about how there are a good amount of companies who would train their new employees or even paid for their training/education, bc that's how my mom got her lifetime career, and it was one of my main goal in grinding that school life. Let's just say we was not economics, and didn't see ish coming. Plus those stories my parents told me was from the 90s, so yea..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got my first job at 16, too. No prior experience, just school clubs on my resume-and I got hired. Now I'm in college and have spent the last two years bouncing from jobs that were either running a skeleton crew or didn't have "enough hours." I'm literally in food service, this is ridiculous.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 24 and i wish i had done it like you. I regret not getting a job in high school 😭😭 it makes me wonder if I would’ve had better luck with my searches during/after college. But i was so depressed for most of hs idk if I would’ve been able to handle a job :((( then most of college was covid times. Riiippp
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Would have been ace rage bait though

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @katyaevza6419  bro I seen it go out after their first check 😂😂😂😂😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @katyaevza6419 eventually your value becomes about what you can do while you’re dead inside too. Reality will eventually hit this person that hard work matters about 60% and the other 40% is just the right people knowing what you do and valuing it. And then the question is what they do in that case. I’ve worked hard my first 7 years in the workforce, but I’ve also come to learn recently as I’m sure this kid will that the work will never end and it will never be appreciated fully. Work hard, but don’t enslave yourself. Because everyone will let you if it makes life easier for them.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We had phones from work at IBM in the 90s. My husband was sick with pneumonia and was a scheduled service planning manager and American Express went down. Do you think IBM cared that he had a 102° fever? But when his dad worked for IBM and his brother was dying of cancer, IBM drove him and his wife and sick son to Sloan Kettering for his treatment and gave him as much time as he wanted to deal with his 2 year old dying. These companies changed. When I was in high school and worked for an attorney (I was so lucky to work there) and my father died the attorney paid me for a full week of work, came to my father’s funeral and gave me extra hours to work — like sitting at a desk answering phones on Christmas Eve and being paid $200 for the day. He was basically giving me money because he knew we didn’t have any. I was a HIGH SCHOOL kid who worked for him sophomore through senior year and then he had me work full-time in summers. I would still walk through hot coals for him.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Working the job is the easy part, getting it seems borderline impossible as of late. Took me like 2 months to land a stocking job bro shit was ass, good luck to y'all out there.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Man....it took me 6 years to find a job after losing my last one. 33,000 applications, half being one click apply, and the other half basically being done by hand, and tailored for each position i applied to.   Applying to jobs became a full time job itself, finally landing a job in January this year (2025). Went from being an architectural engineer to just being on a dishwashing team with nearly a hundred people. This job market is truly hell.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've been living on my own since I went to university at 19. I rented a place just a few minutes away and stayed there even after earning my degree and starting my first office job. But shit hits the fan came the pandemic, and I had to return to my parents house, to my old room which they graciously kept tidy. Been doing odd jobs and some freelance work since, but I get by. So, I just wanna say that I hope you all have a place to return to, a family, and people who'll welcome you back in times of crisis.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I remember being younger being judged by adults. I mess with gen Z heavy. My condolences y'all have to go through this .
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If yall are looking for jobs, apply with the USPS. Always hiring, and the more gen z mailmen we have demanding more money, the better.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We have two Gen Z on our project management team and they are honestly my favorite guys.  They both really get into the work, want to learn how to work smarter so they have less stress (which is how I like to work), and always deliver.  We do have flexible work hours (as long as it's 40 hours a week) and schedule meetings a week in advance at minimum, and there has never been a problem with them showing up to meetings.  However, both of them did need to be coached on "soft skills" and (because this is project management) how to keep things on track when people don't want to meet deadlines.  It's hard for them to be assertive and they don't yet have enough life experience to know how to do it well.  Guess what?  This is something we all had to go through, and the real problem is the lack of mentorship in workplaces now.  You can't just print workers at college and expect them to do everything perfectly for your particular industry and company - you have to develop talent.   I always tell people to ask "how do you develop talent in your employees?" when they interview for a job, and to remember that the interview is as much for you to see if you like the company values as for the company to evaluate you.  Really listen for the answer, and if you get a bunch of marketing speak and buzz words, take that as a sign.  Some jobs are just jobs until you can find your career.  Oh, and by that same token, if you do take a temporary/contract job, always conduct yourself with the same professionalism you would in a full-time job because you never know how that might pay off.  One of the guys I mentioned came to us because he took a temp contract with one of our customers during their implementation, and when we found out they weren't keeping him, we asked if he would consider working with us.   He was professional, chill, and a quick learner who adapted well - all things we look for.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: On the soft skills training. I was pushing for a well deserved promotion (I managed an intern, lead multiple projects, did most of my bosses job) they ran out of excuses, so they sent me a soft skills list I needed to work on. I looked my boss and just said "you know this isn't real right?" And he was like "yeah". I quit
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is comforting in a cruel way to me right now. I’m not alone in this which feels so reliving.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've applied to over 300 jobs and i can say the very best way to confirm a job opening is through calling or sending a mail to HR. I've called about even older openings and just asks if this is still available and sometimes they even forget that they have it open, when they don't even want to find new people. Tell them your name and what you do and that you would love to send them an application, if they are interested. It's very direct and i know social anxiety is high but this is probably the best way to have direct contact with them make yourself seen and known before you apply. Then when you send an application, they will remember you quicker and look at your application for a few minutes longer than others who just applied without any prior contact. It gives you a bigger chance at getting into the next round of interviews. Hope that helps. Also if you have friends looking for the same thing, make sure to keep in contact and update each other. Gatekeeping Jobs is kind of lame imo

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You got the nerve to be happy? You will be depressed by Friday. Congrats on getting income that’s it. Sht will be miserable though
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hope you had a great first week!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @IntoTheSkyy it’s been going great so far! I love my coworkers and the work
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Good luck. Don't let it drag you down! 😁
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Start looking for your next job now. You’ll be laid off within the next two years.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Good luck i hope it works out well for you!! :D
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How is that even allowed, gosh.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @fraxism.8637  It isn't, it's illegal, but the law only exists for poors. We haven't been living in a real, functioning country since before I was born.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's because American Business owners are wannabe dictators/tyrants in their own little business kingdom. If you won't immediately and unconditionally lick their boot you are marked.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @spencerschultz I think that’s being known as petty bourgeois
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: and so they can do some weird tax scam, because they can call themselves "growing" and that gives you benefits
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Then boomers and our oligarch overlords wonder why people do not want kids. Why the fuck would we want to bring kids into this hellhole when we cant even live!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nah I smell bs. I'm in the construction industry myself and there's always SOMETHING open for a guy of your qualifications. And how exactly did you survive 6 years with no job?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @therealsapdad1942 Because its architecture bro, not exactly blue collar work. I have a friend who graduated from architecture last year, and the only places willing to hire her were either tiny startups or tyrannical + understaffed design firms that pinched every worker for pennies. That was 2 out of the hundreds of applications she sent out, and we don't even live in the US. I imagine things are a hundred times worse in your country.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If it takes you 6 years to get a job, your the problem.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I love your energy, even if its not everyone's reality. Going to be going permanently NC with my mother after being threatened with eviciton from an apartment I pay for. This would be the 3rd time I'd be homeless. No other family. Being disabled and autistic is trying with these circumstances.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Living with your family as a young adult and helping out any way you can (even if your income is low) has been completely normal throughout a vast majority of human history. All this pressure to spend the first 22 years of your life sitting in school, then the next 40 years selling your soul for someone else’s gain is completely artificial and straight up unhealthy.   We evolved to help each other out to survive, and in the modern era it’s all about individuality, how much money you make as an individual, how many qualifications you have as an individual. But that’s not actually normal at all.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m so sorry you’re going through it!!! Please keep your head up and take care of yourself. This world is better with you in it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Me rn I just wanna scream sometimes
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's not  you, it's the world we live in. Keep working on yourself,  and pray to God for help. Goodluck.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Do you work there, I heard it is always hiring because the hours are long, management sucks, and you are basically working 6 days a week.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @hellothere4765 when you start out as a CCA yes, the first 2 years are like that. But its far better than what it used to be like, and the unions are pushing to end the CCA starting position. Once you've become a regular after 2 years you can join the "8 hour list" which means no OT. Government pension, military time buyout, the usps aint bad at all, and its easy as fuck
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The bully victim part is a joke, i only get bullied by my friends at work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a professional junior and bully victim at work. I completely agree, the guys that like me would kill for me to be on their crew and I always try to do better than last time. But when im working with people i dont know(or my exs dad) they expect me to know how they want things done before they tell me and im not assertive enough to tell them their expectations are unreasonable. And when i do assert myself i work in the oilfield so it always turns into a fist fight.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Spacing. PLEASE learn how to use it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That’s all too common. Every freaking entry level position requires experience… so where tf is that supposed to come from???
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @LilyGazou that’s not paper work experience
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a British person living in France... Don't worry, the British live to work too. We're much closer to the US way of living than we'd like to admit. The french however? 1 hour lunch breaks, 35 hour work week, 30 days paid holidays (+ about 14 bank holidays some years although our prime minister is an idiot and did say he wanted to delete two). Not sure how things will progress considering our current economy but yeah
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The US ruling class never felt fear and Americans are kept ignorant on purpose to keep it that way. You want European level work life balance? Do as they do. That mario brother had the right idea. You cant vote your way out of this. You need to make your ruling class fear you. Not protesting, not a vote. In the US it will require the children of politicians to fear for their lives. They need to fear you more than they fear their donors. If you are unwilling or think its immoral, than you will never have this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Maybe you should take the first shot then, dawg. I think you are right in that they should fear the power of the masses, but I don't think bloodthirst is a good way to make a positive change. That's just fighting cruelty with more cruelty.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Europe is literally no different
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Job boards really need to crack down on “ghost” job descriptions. TOS should define a valid posting strictly as a role a company is actively hiring for and ban companies with multiple ghost posting offenses. Fake postings hurt applicants and give us a wildly unrealistic view of economic conditions.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "nobody wants to work" as we age faster because we're being worked 60 hours a week and not even being given a raise.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z, please keep doing whatever you're doing... please break them. Bankrupt then. Annoy them. I can never get enough of enterpreneurial tears.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you for being a source of comfort  in these dark times ❤❤ To everyone out there just know the feeling is shared.    I graduated in the summer and have been struggling so hard especially with the amount of stages that are in recruitment these days. It’s really affected my will to live I didn’t think I could ever be so depressed but these days I am really struggling to leave my room
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have a literal degree from an Ivy & Oxford. Have a letter of recommendation from the Dean after graduating in the top 10%. Had an internship at a major American company. Speak 6 languages.  After 3 years and over 2,000 job applications, I have managed to get a job at a lumber mill for $13 an hour.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i appreciate a worker that can be themselves more instead of forcefully be made to smile
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hi, 32-year-old millennial here. Um, it's not great out here for us either. We are all in hell. This is one of those times where the generation war is non-existent. We are all not having a good time. Even minimum wage jobs are hard to get! I HATE my job but I can't leave because the market is a hellscape. Yes, it's harder to get a job these days but it's harder for everyone. No hate to our bi king, I'm just frustrated.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nothing worse than doing great in an interview, You and the interviewer are bantering than getting an email saying “ your not the correct fit for the environment “ 💔please just be cold to me in the interview so I don’t get my hopes up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: lmao i just got an ad for indeed on this video 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Everything either a ghost job or a job that pays you so little you need to stay living at home or with 3 roommates just to have a few bucks in your bank account
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I remember when the "Gen Z stare" was just the retailer stare back when I grew up as a kid and all the Gen Xers were in those jobs. What's old is new again. I think we need to throw away these petty, generational divides and come together to create a new societal contract where 95% of us aren't getting screwed so 1% of us can have unparalleled levels of power over society.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My friday meetings being so for real XD
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1:57 I FEEL SO SEEN RIGHT NOW! I was feeling so depressed abt myself and failing job hunt. This video makes me feel like I'm not a failure 🥹 🙏🏿 / not alone.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 5:52 that is the cutest a ceiling fan ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 12:38 I see the problem is rather that he shared his personal and private agenda. Do not elaborate, do not give out your phone number, or at least only answer during work hours. NEVER ever see HR and the company as your friends and family. So don‘t explain yourself. It‘ll only give you more points for attacks.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Those villains are generalising a whole generation😠 My gen Z coworkers are intelligent, skilled and hard working. They are also lovely people. I’m gen X btw. And I don’t understand what businesses that don’t hire younger people are going to do in the future with an ageing workforce retiring all at once. Go full AI?😨Elderly people also need care and I doubt AI can fully substitute human hands and interactions. But who knows? Looks like we’re all cooked. Well, most of us not on the top are😵‍💫
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's infuriating how we (gen z) get shit for being the generation to finally have enough self-respect and a spine to not be doing work for free or to the detriment of our health, while also being able to deliver quality work. People are mad at us for fighting for the things they either never had to fight for or never dared to fight for but we bring real change. I work with a lot of millenial people and it astonishes me how they either don't care or just silently agree with the whims of boomers in charge just because "he's the boss". Yes, basic respect is a given but so is not being a raging sexist/racist/homophobe/etc in the office while contributing nothing as the person on top. Can't wait for some of them to get retired.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We are literally living through the great depression x2 and no one can convince me otherwise
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The amount of cashier jobs i found that required like 3 years of experience was insane.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bankrupt them?? They're just getting richer
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m so sorry :/ that is a really shitty situation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i mean tbf you'e way above me, but i know 8 languages fairly well and I've landed three interviews this year, all of which rejected me of course. I can't anymore man. return monke.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: $13 hr as of now? How are you even surviving?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​ @xRetroZone English - Writing & Journalism. I have a substitute teaching license, a certificate for ancient text care and restoration, and formal training in Latin.   My internship was in video game design and Narrative Design. I'm certified to work in Unity and UE5.   And I have 3 years of experience working as a journalist for a wellknown name, trained additionally in SEO.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s time for you to move to a different city or even country.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @RUGrimm-fv5if I’m sure you have a lot on your plate, but if you actually speak 6 languages, have you ever thought of using Preply or something similar as a side hustle?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: But yeah.. I'm sorry for your situation. 😢
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh my god.. I have a learning disorder but still graduated on time and only got my high school diploma, got hired as a janitor for 16 an hour part time and can move to full time if wanted in only 5 months. Maybe that’s because I had experience cleaning an amusement park from a summer job but still. How did this happen to you😭 it really depends on where you live as well. I moved to the city where there was a higher need for people to work
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Genuine advice, go into translation for the county or courts. Almost always hiring and the pay is insane for the limited workload
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I speak 27 languages and have a PhD in Underwater Backflip Numerology and am forced to work at McDonald's
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @ChubakaSteven Unrealistic. I applied to McDonald's twice and got rejected for being overqualified. Try at KFC next time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @ChubakaSteven yeah me too, it's like they don't even care that I'm the world champion in sponge eating
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You’re a perfect example of everything wrong with a job candidate
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i can tell why you havent been hired
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well you took a risk. Could've made it big time, but not all risks pan out. I just jumped through the hoops and played the game. Got a normal, salt of the earth degree in secondary education. Got a teaching job immediately following college. They paid for most of my master's degree. Not everyone gets to make video games homie. Always time to learn a valuable skill or trade
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @SpineOfGod1304 10/10 ragebait
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thats crazy because I only have s bachelors degree and make 30$ in Cali working for a college. I only put in like 5 applications too and got the 3rd job I interviewed for🎉
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @JJ-me4yu  Doesnt reflect the reality of everyone. Good for you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @JJ-me4yu  Good for you? This is a weird ass thing to comment after what op said
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Girl Im 40 with 2 degrees and sling around dirty, heavy boxes all day. And have 2 side jobs teaching fitness and yoga classes. I see you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: A few years older than you and I agree. Another problem I think no one talks about enough is that when positions do open up, they get passed to people already in the company. Training new people takes time and it's another risk most companies don't want to take. Can speak from personal experience on that front, as all my managers want new blood and fresh perspectives and the executives in charge utterly refuse to entertain the idea.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wdym "32 year old millennial" I'm 29, I thought I was a zoomer ;w;
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @ZZSFAN Nope. Youngest millennials are 28 or 29 now. Youngest Gen Z are, I think, 9 or 10. Every generation is about 20 years, but there IS some overlap that you could argue.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No one said it wasn't. But it's frustrating when millenials and boomers keep opening their filthy mouths to tell young people that they aren't working hard enough.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @abdulhakeemabdulwahab8229  This was a completely unnecessary response in all honesty.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@abdulhakeemabdulwahab8229  Most millennials wouldn't say that because they're stuck in the same or worse situation than Gen z. Now, if the Gen z genuinely doesn't do a thing, then someone should speak up about it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​​ @abdulhakeemabdulwahab8229 I don't think the VAST majority of millennials say that. Cause we are in the same damn boat. We heard and still hear that same shit directed at us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: omfg yes. that's hat completely killed my drive lol.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s just another invented way to separate the masses to keep us powerless and bickering amongst each other rather than look at who the real problem is.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same bro it’s real, let’s hope it gets better for all of us 🙏🏾
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z will give their all for a good job . Those are just vanishingly rare.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Most people on top are gen x though not boomers. While I disagree with some of what you are saying, I agree that a lot of millennials stay longer unpaid. If you pay me for 7.5 hours I’ll work for that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It also astonishes me how they forget that they will rely on US when they’re no longer able to use basic motor functions or form coherent thoughts. Gen z isn’t the baby generation anymore. Its oldest is 28 and majority of us will hold positions in office that determine our economic standards and those that came before us. So they should treat us nicely or face the consequences from what they stole from us, which is the opportunity to live our 20’s and 30’s successfully.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Treating boomers like one entity that stole from you is childish. I wouldn’t look at someone’s grandpa and be like “man he stole my 20s”. Realize that the people in power make change, not random old people
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think Rise Against put it best, "We are the orphans of the American Dream"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I accidentally stumbled into my dream job at the Post Office after being laid off during the pandemic.  Alone on the street, cruising around the neighborhood all day, listening to tunes, getting fresh air and exercise… it can’t be beat.  I’ll never willingly go back to the hamster wheel of soul-sucking corporate nonsense.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We get 2 choices: work a miserable job or be unemployed and miserable
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: After graduating earlier this year I’ve been going through some of the most severe depression of my life trying to secure a job. I really appreciate your video 🙂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen z here. for any gen z looking for jobs i highly recommend looking into manufacturing. Pays well for the work you do surprisingly. figured i would point this out because i wouldn't have thought i would be doing this and making more money than if i used my associates degree.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wow you weren't kidding you literally ran this channel up in 6 months 🔥🔥🔥 incredibly fire
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The janitor job hit hard. I've applied for 4 janitor jobs cleaning toilets and was rejected by all 4. The reason for rejection was no experience. The default reason
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a film graduate, this whole video is so validating. I live in London and for the longest time I believed it's a UK job market problem, not global. Here it's not only the fact that you can't find jobs to save your life. When you find one, they only want you on a freelancing contract, especially in the creative industry and sometimes even in hospitality.  I have been forced to work in hospitality to have a roof over my head and even then, oh well they can only give 0h contracts which means no pension scheme or benefits for 9h or 10h per day slaving away in a cafe. No cleaning or prep payment in most cases also.  So yeah, can confirm it's a shit show for the zoomers no matter the continent and job market/industry. Took me a long time to get over it, but your content brough me a bit of hope for our generation. Keep up with the good videos! ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 18:13 that lady is in the same market as the company that sells Kevlar backpacks to school kids. During the gold rush it was more lucrative to sell shovels than it was to mine the gold.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a new grad desperately looking for a job in my field and even a part time job to supplement income in the meantime but having no luck, it’s oddly relieving to see I’m not alone and that it’s not just a me thing, even though none of us should be struggling like this. My confidence has been shot so much in this job market and the financial stress from having no income certainly doesn’t help. It’s a nightmare out there and I’m honestly not sure where we are heading right now, it’s scary.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: gen Z laziness is just normal laziness/giving up in the face of the current economy. anyone else would do the same in their shoes, so they're actually not that unique in that regard. its tough to blame them especially when nobody explains to them how company rep directly influences their job security. thats just a failing on the employer (read: toxic positivity)  gen z stare is absolutely a thing though lol and its not 'customer service stare', they didn't invent that it's been around forever. instead they'll just seize up and stare at the floor when you say "so howsit going" while you two wait on something.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The ONLY reason I am doing okay right now is because I did what my dad and a long line of paternal ancestors did, who were all dirt poor and had no where to go in life: joined the Navy. It was hard, it sucked, and I was fortunate to be with a group of really good people that were all in the same lot as me (poor, directionless, and in need of stability). Thankfully we spent 4 years floating around the Pacific, minding our own business and not involved in any harmful action - not everyone is as lucky. I got out with a job and my moral compass in tact, which not everyone gets.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Let’s all just go into a time machine back to when we were 16-17 working our first Burger King job those were the only happy times I can remember working a job 😭😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 34 years old master automotive tech, and the company I worked for went out of business 3 months ago due to the economy being shit.  Was making $50/hr @ 30hrs a week, and now the best wage I can find is about $20-25, but nobody is hiring… All this BS about getting a blue collar career goes out the window when the rest of the economy tanks to the point that people can’t even afford groceries, let alone vehicle repairs…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The perk of living in a small town is that I applied for a job a day later I had an interview and two days later I had my first shift. This was my first job
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Christ Jesus, life is going to shit so bad that while I'm looking for a new job, I'm also holding onto my current job with my dear life 😭😭 before I'd only apply to a few jobs because I'd always get interviews, but now I'm getting rejected with no feedback from almost every job application or just straight up ghosted 😩 like wtf I have more qualifications than I had before!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The two AI’s having a chat during an interview, reminded of when you use to put to multiple furbys together & they would talk gibberish forever lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: OUR BI KING HAS ONCE AGAIN UPLOADED 🎉
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sent this video to both of my Gen Z sons (I’m Gen X).  The oldest’s response (soon-to-be college junior)…”Well, f*ck”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: off topic but i love your steve wonder pfp. my favorite album of his.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: wish they did walking post office roles near me. all of 'em require a driving license
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @zakohat365  it’s structured so that you get 40 hrs/wk but depends on the office, your route, time of year, number of vacant route, etc.   There’s also an overtime desired list if you’re into that kinda stuff.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You must be at a good office. Starting where I am after a few weeks it’s straight to 60 hours a week or more.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @cryptRobert  mine was 60+ a week for a few years until management got off their asses and started hiring. There’s light at the end of the tunnel! Best of luck, friend 🙂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: To each their own…sounds terrible to me.  I prefer the cubicle lol.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Similar experience to you my friend, listening to podcasts daily, no one bossing me around, I get my own route and retire by 56!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Machines will soon take this job from you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Corporate in the US 😂😂😂 that's just your mockery of a country, lmao.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well, I hate to say the contrary but I have sent out multiple upon multiple job applications to machine shops and I got nothing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Can i ask what kind of jobs you’re applying for as a film graduate? It sounds interesting to me but I always wondered.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Taylor_mamaof3 yes, of course. Usually depends what your department is, for example I am a camera operator, but I can also assist and be a director of photography depending on the project, so I would apply to camera department roles. It's mostly a freelance industry where it matters a lot what people you know and how flexible you are with times and location. Also luck plays a big role, to run tinto someone that might need an operator or a videographer.  The majority of new entrants like myself start as runners and work their way up into their desired role, but often everyone is doing short films, music videos or social media on the side. The goal is always to work for major studios, but it's rare if you're still young. Hope this answers your question ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: At least you're not in debt, so the only way you're going is up 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No offense but it's film, you're going to have a hard time finding a job regardless of the market
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You make less money than people working at Walmart 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @jamess359  how do you know? What a weird, rude assumption to make.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @jamess359 thank you for your reply also! Very kind of you to let me know and be supportive! I appreciate it.  Mind sharing some insight about Walmart salaries btw? Seems like you've had a few.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m an older gen z and while I can be awkward most people I interact with interpret me as friendly and extroverted while internally I am socially anxious. My younger brother who is also Gen Z but from 2010 grew up as an iPad baby and I can definitely see him pulling the Gen z stare or straight up ignoring people 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That was my plan too until the recruiters told me I have mental illnesses that make me a liability and need to be unmedicated for several years before I can enlist
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ultimately, I dont think Canadian gen z can complain right now. Im 20 and Im definitely struggling, but im so proud to be Canadian, alberta has one of the lowest costs of living on planet earth and has one of the highest standard of living. We’re holding strong through these hard times. And i encourage any young person to get a Canadian permanent residency visa before carneys bill starts lowering temporary visas and making it harder to get a permanent. Canada is making our march onto the world stage nows the time to move.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well, I’ll pay you to get a Chevy van and an f150 back on the road. I had to park them during the pandemic.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Really good point! I hope you find something!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is why I think this is a uniquely American issue. Im blue collar in canada, not a single worry in the world for my job. My stepdad got laid off from his light duty mechanic job in the mine 10 years ago because the town burned to the ground. But barring natural disasters, canada has never had an issue employing its people and mark carney is making strides to ease job market conditions. Such as lowering the cap on work visas.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @elise2892 yeah he mentioned it in few videos
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am and I think he could be Ngl.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Calm down, just means he’s bi-corporate curious.  Applies for corporate jobs while trashing them on the internet.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How dare his hinge matches have no decorum
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So when’s the other shoe gonna drop lmao. I used to be “bi” in highschool too. Until I grew a pair just admitted I was gay lmao. Bffr.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I once got rejected for a job because I wanted to work too many hours...  I asked for the middle ground of what they offered in the job listing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a younger millenial, and when I was in university and after that started to work I've read a lot of shit on the internet or in newspapers, that we are shit workers, because we don't have the same loyality than our parents and that our quality of work is trash too. There is nothing new under the sun.  At least we didn't face recession (even though it took me half a year to get a job with an IT degree and everybody said it will be easy)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And they wonder why we're all depressed.. "must be them phones!" Smh.  A good option for young people is to go into healthcare, as the pay is livable and there's always a need for healthcare workers, so it's a very stable career. It's definitely a very difficult job (especially if you live in a state that doesn't have good healthcare worker protection and unions), but even if you later decide you want to quit nursing, it won't be a "waste" of time/money because the skills and knowledge are applicable to daily life (imo as a nurse, schools should be teaching basic nursing to kids), and there's also many different jobs within nursing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Man even getting a job at a minimum wage fast food job is impossible
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I agree, "Easy Apply" means "Easily Ignore"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I applied to a job and they reach out 2 years later 😂😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not me hopping on YouTube at 4am and seeing this in my recommended after literally spending an hour and a half on indeed because my job anxiety won’t let me sleep 🥲.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Currently in a job which is obliterating my mental health. I feel like I'm trapped though as it took me a year of job searching to just get this job by pure chance
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hate my corporate job. We used to work hybrid which helped me cope but we are office full time and I do not have enough education or experience to job hop to a hybrid or remote role. Even when you are in the work force it also sucks ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: got a youtube ad for indeed while watching this😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im a millenial and i figured out early that this country was a scam lmao  its like you expect me to bend over backwards for a fast food job that pays peanuts and cut my hours to shit anyway because i had a mental breakdown due to being expected to run the entire front line BY MY FUCKING SELF because they didn't want to hire more people??? haha no thanks, minimum wage minimum effort   job shit/job culture is diabolical
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What each generation completely forgets repeatedly (without fail) is that each generation has its flaws and weaknesses, but also strengths and insights. Like, blaming each other won’t get us anywhere.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 3:40 is so accurate. I remember seeing people get hired on the spot without paying attention to what was asked. People that gave thought to what they were asked were told “we’ll call”. I guess the only thing that changed is everyone is getting no interview.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Everything they say about gen z is the same thing they said about milenials, and so in an so forth.  Couple of years you'll see gen z teasing the next gen for the same exact reasons...  Back in the early 20th century they claimed the new generations were lazy because of radio and television. Then the great depression hit and they sent those generations to two different horrific wars... Now we call them the "greatest generation" but their elders used to trash them sooo much is the point I'm making
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a graphic designer, who just graduated with BA, and I’ve been looking for a job for over a month now.  Not a single reply or interview.  I have job experience, I worked for two years as a social media manager for a Russian celebrity, and I worked for a year in a design agency. I designed ads for magazines like Vogue and Vanity Fair. I have more than 9 years of experience in photoshop.   What I’m trying to tell — I have more than enough technical skills and experience. There’s just no way I’m under qualified for all jobs.  I recently just moved to US, and I’m telling you, I’m starting to think the only way to get a job, is thru connections…  I’m just really giving up at this point a little bit
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got laid off my job about a month ago and have been trying to find literally anything. While talking to my brother, I complained about how I hate feeling like the only way to get anywhere is to be a complete sellout brown-noser. He mentioned how everyone at the office he works at hates the "rat race", but still acknowledge that its just part of work culture.  My response: "Why are we okay with it being that way? Why don't we all do something to just get rid of it? If everybody hates it so much, why is it still around???" I think it says a lot about those who are in these higher up positions.  I'm so exhausted with the world...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think it’s time we all sign the general strike card
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: A job emailed me today a rejection later, mind you I applied to that in October 2024, ITS SEPTEMBER 19, 2025!!! I BEEN KNEW 😭😭😭😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As someone on the late end of millennial, it’s confusing to me when older millennials get mad at things like that and don’t seem to remember what we went through and are still going through. For me, I felt like I knew that wouldn’t go over well but there is another way around that. Do not give your employers that much info about your day to day. In her position she could have said it was an appointment, standing appointment (if this is a repeating meeting) or even just a health related commitment. These employers do not care about their employees and being honest about what you have going on can often be more hurtful than helpful. If you stopped being profitable for them you would be gone tomorrow, so you do need to treat them the same. It’s really the only way to not feel like your soul is getting eaten away at.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: we did face recession lol. the 2008 recession lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @lgfuad4lyf  Yeah but it bounced back fast and everything was still dirt cheap.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennials and gen z dont have loyalty because these companies give us 0 reasons to like them, let alone be loyal to them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: funny how boomers keep talking shit to every generation after them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: These companies’ management teams of people with a house in Boca and a chalet in Aspen will gaslight our generations until they’re in the dirt. They know full well that our generation is more effective than any boomer that ever worked for them. We learned from young ages as the digital world evolved how to actually harness computer technology to be more effective at a fraction of the effort. We learned to be smarter rather than work harder. They go “they’re lazy.” And we stand there like “actually we’re better than you.” My 70 year old uncle has straight up admitted at this point that people like me an his kids work harder for shittier pay than he or anyone he knows ever did.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I dont know like I dont remember IT degree people working in McDonalds like right now
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "There's always a need for [job x]" I've heard that too many times. Yeah, we need them but it always becomes oversaturated by the time you finish your education
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @MegaFooby based on the data, we are soon going to have an aging population, plus after covid a ton of nurses quit due to burnout, so we need more healthcare workers and that won't change anytime soon. And there will always be a need for nurses, because everyone needs healthcare at some point in their life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nursing is NOT going to help anyone's mental state, you'll always work long shifts and always be on call.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@Adventeuanon call is only for nurses who work in surgery. I'm not suggesting this for people's mental state, I'm suggesting it as a stable and livable wage job. Currently there is no dream jobs that pay well and don't work you to death, but at least healthcare is stable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: healthcare is depressing as hell. I've watched parents panic because they couldn't afford their kid's chemo. I've watched insurance charge $292 for ONE session of physical therapy. Healthcare is the land of burnout. The amount of research that goes into burnout, depression, and suicide in healthcare is insane.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @omgitschristina0 true, but you get used to it for the most part... like I definitely wouldn't recommend pediatric nursing to any soft hearted people (depending on the specialty within pediatric), and some specialties are more depressing than others, like hospice nursing, trauma, and psychiatric. But there's also more happy nursing jobs, I did a rotation at a dialysis center for kids and it was a very positive atmosphere, and many say that rehab is great because you're helping people on their path to recovery. Surgery is great for those who find that stuff interesting (I loved seeing all the different surgeries, it was fascinating). And if a desk job is more your speed, you can work at a day clinic, or at a med spa.  Obviously insurance/healthcare cost in the US is extremely depressing, I know this from being both a nurse and a patient,  but you're there to help patients through it and advocate for them to get them the care they need. We do what we can, and we can either ignore the problem by avoiding jobs that remind us of it, or we can at the very least help people going through it and comfort them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Lol what? Still way better than being jobless on the verge of homelessness. Everyone has a hard time, but this comment is a little bit tone deaf
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @angelwut469 lol I can’t afford affordable housing 😅 I am one emergency away from being homeless. Your comment is tone death. Assuming people with corporate jobs can afford to live comfortably.. I am pay check to paycheck
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​ @angelwut469 Your comment isn't helpful. 60% of the US lives paycheck to paycheck and will work themselves to death without retirement. How is that any better? Your struggle is one struggle. The working class struggle.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's reactive abuse. The jobs abuse the crap out of employees. When the employee understandably suffers mental breakdowns or even just cries a bit at work, they get fired. That pattern is identical to what abusers do. It's designed to ruin your mental health.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Isn't there a saying that goes "every generation thinks it's smarter than the one that came before and wiser than the one that comes after." I could be misremembering.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nah one keeps on calling the others lazy and not understanding what the actual issue is.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Very well said, I suspect that we will learn unity though tough times ahead. Make necessary preparations for an potential recession my friend
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Criticizing late stage capitalism is not "playing the blame game", it IS a broken system keeping people miserable while billionaires get richer
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, man. Gen X completely abdicated their social responsibilities to future generations and are actively fighting back against addressing the issues, but Nirvana was a cool band, so it's kind of a wash.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: But blaming and shaming is much much easier than talking with each other about current problems and worries... Its humiliating.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Actually, it does. What doesn't do anything usefull is making a blind-eye to what causes the problem or who causes the harm
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't think any strenght or insight can come from a generation who was exposed to lead in everything lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have three STEM degrees, my PhD is from the best uni in the world at that time. It took me over six MONTHS to find a job, and it paid terribly. And it was a terrible job. This was 8 years ago. And I had relevant extracurricular experiences for the jobs I applied to and didn't need a visa sponsor.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @billiemunchen They might need you in Silicon Valley, you never know.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Connections should help, not be the only ticket to get your foot in the door. It’s weird since with connections, you can’t tell what job that person will hook you up for upfront, you just have to hope you connect with the right person or else your connections will be meaningless. Plus, how did everyone else get hired? Someone needed to drop a resume before people could network.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This 100 %. I refuse to continue struggling in a system that is built to make us all suffer. We need to threaten the corporate wallets, the banks. They can't jail us all if we all stop paying the system at the same time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am so shocked by how little of this sentiment I've seen in the comments
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @tinaodekunle8163  I’m saying. Idk what it is. Too deeply embedded anti-union propaganda??
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: literally, people need to get a lot angrier before things will change
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @endlessBP247 yeah pedagogy of the oppressed opened my eyes that people are being sheltered from consequences and won’t defend themselves until they stop blaming other oppressed people instead of their oppressors
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Nobody wants to work anymore," while basically every single Gen Z is actively trying to find work and/or further their career. These people live in delulu land where any complaint from younger generations is just due to laziness or something.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: All I could think of at the start was The Room. "OH hi Mark"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What a serendipitous time to open YouTube and see this video. As Ive just gotten home from driving Lyft— the work I pick up after I get off the two other jobs I have during the day. Spoiler, all three of these jobs have nothing to do with my undergrad or graduate level degree ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a substitute teacher and I just finished my masters degree. Now that I’m having to look for work over the summer I’m considering hiding the fact that I have a graduate degree to get hired at a “lower level” job over the summer
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: genuinely feeling like the “this is fine.🙂🔥” meme rn in this country
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Had got laid off and thankfully it only took me 5 months to get a job (I've seen people going a year plus so I'm grateful it only took 5 months). It feels like a humilation process going through the interview process where these people are asking for manual labour of projects, presentations, multiple round of interviews, written assignments, case studies, etc for some of these companies to have the AUDACITY to not even get back to you. Very grateful to have finally got a job in an industry I've always wanted to pivot into and a wage that is fairly high. I'm consistently praying for everyone else in my generation for this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I had one day of 9-7 and i felt so depreesed, the next day i apologise to my boss and came back to my home
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im 16 and I got a job at dunkin. the job is pretty good honestly, but the application process was BULLSHIT. I had to do it online and there was only an ai to look over my resume. if I didnt have the correct trigger words I wouldn't have gotten an interview. im unbelievably lucky to have a job and im so sorry to the people who cant get one in this stupid system.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 8:44 I just had to do this the other day. It definitely tripped me out and I already knew that I wasn’t going to get hired because I wasn’t speaking to a human being. I got an email 30 minutes later saying that they were going to move on with another candidate.😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The key is to always have a backup! Even if you are employed, be on the lookout for new opportunities! I am employed but I am looking elsewhere for better opportunities!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think both gen z and the workplace need to change, just mostly the workplace
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a millennial, every millennial who says that office politics decorum comes naturally is a liar and a hack. Goes for every generation but still. Employers are dumb as rocks 90% of the time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What's horrifying is that people's side hustle is basically prostitution. Like people may make it in a comedic manner, but i find this very disturbing. People are so desperate that they go as far as to sell their body to survive. Like are you sure america is a first world country and not a third world country?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: From Canada, new teacher. Applied to different school boards and waited a YEAR for interviews to get on the supply list. And even now there are MORE hoops to jump to even work a day. It’s a fucking mess.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as someone who actually suffers from mental illnesses badly enough for them to cause physical pain, I am just fucked, but at least I am learning painting model kits, I'll try comissions once the recession is over, maybe I'll be able to keep my factory job if I stop being in pain
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have applied for jobs EVERY SINGLE WAY POSSIBLE! The job market is just so tough that even if you are 100% qualified and 200% overqualified, you still most likely wont get accepted. Which is what’s happened with me. I am stuck doing minimum wage and EVEN THOSE are hard to get because they hire referred people over others. I use indeed to find companies and then go to companies to apply to jobs. For minimum wage i tailor 1 resume for a category of jobs, cashiers and just crazy apply. NO NEED FOR COVER LETTERS. BUT for career jobs, always have job tailored ATS friendly resume, lots of key words, and a cover letter thats short but ATS friendly as well. I have been doing everything right, but it’s just really hard right now. You are not the problem, the job market is the problem. I am kinda depressed cause i have been looking for career job since July last year and nothing still (i have gotten 2 interviews, both failed), but i have to keep pushing myself cause i have no other choice.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i sometimes feel a bit of regret for using escapism too often then i actually lock in and try in life and i'm like ah yea.... no wonder I don't do this. It is endless frustration, challenges and just having to accept a pile of sh*t
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My friend got her Doctorate a couple years ago. She tried applying to another job in her field that paid a 63% higher wage than her current job, only required a Bachelor's Degree, and they rejected her application because she was overqualified and could make a legal case that she should be paid more. She was devastated about it, and then her boss gave her a hefty pay raise to keep her with them and cited her Doctorate to her own superior as to why she should be making more at their facility.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not me clicking on this video without noticing it was posted like A MINUTE AGO oh my gosh 😂

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When they say "the recession is near" it means we are already in a recession
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am very blessed to have a job rn. But before this, one of the places I applied to that actually got back to me scheduled an interview (over the phone). Day of I was so nervous and prepared and excited (mind you this was minimum wage retail, but I was so happy to have heard back from anyone) and I am awaiting the call. After 10-15 minutes I get nothing. I call the number they had given me previously and no one had a clue that there was meant to be an interview that day, the person who was meant to was not there. I got an email like a whole ass 2 weeks later asking to reschedule. Thankfully I had gotten an in person interview else where that same day. Place I am now. That was 2 years ago, almost exactly and it seems things have only gotten worse. Bless everyone going through this nonsense rn.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When I was in school, I worked in hotels. I started at a 3 star hotel tending to the free breakfast buffet and by the time I graduated college, I was a concierge at a 5 star resort and often interacted with celebs like Emma Stone, Demi Moore, and even Obama. It was fun, we got paid well and had opportunities for extra cash + tips, and were given 50% off at all the hotels and hotel restaurants (still expensive for most employees but for a birthday or special celebration, it was awesome). I got my first internship as a graphic designer 3 years ago and although I hated my time at the company, I couldn't say no when they offered me a job. I've been working there since but I hate it. I have 3 years of industry experience and 3 degrees (1 bachelors, 2 associates) and have been miserable working my dream job. I have gotten my portfolio and resume reviewed, gotten help with my cover letters from old professors, and NOTHING. Returning to hospitality is so tempting but I don't want to give up on my dream just because I've had a terrible experience working at 1 company????? 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i just had a breakdown over an application, and my algorithm suggested this to me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: in russia where i live i regularly get that “gen Z stare” only from gen-X and boomers working in service  like i recently got into a med centre for a check up, first time there, 3 old people employees yelled at me for looking lost
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's not just a gen z problem either, it's gotten to the point that it affects everyone. My mom's job had to closed due to the tariffs, and she's been looking for good work for the last 6 months. She's only been able to get a job at Walmart. I've been having to keep us in the house with my $11 an hour job, while the COO is making half a million a year.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Lmfao. A workout class at 8am is wild 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Millennial, I was laid off 5 times before reaching 30. I feel for you gen Z. It SUCKS! Even more so, the closest time it was this bad was the crash of '08.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got called lazy for not having house and I work the same job
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The gen z stare is a wonderful generational legacy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't care if people use AI to look for jobs and do interviews because these companies are selling their info and using it to improve AI. I feel like sht knowing I did an AI interview and now I have no idea what they've done with my image and voice.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Pro tip: Don’t burn bridges. Most job apps require you to have a minimum of 3 mandatory references. Good luck! Get that job!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im this close to sending suicide notes in response to rejection letters in hopes they feel bad enough to reconsider
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In my 30s with some mild physical and mental disabilities, just gave up on trying to find a job. Had an idea for a side-gig, but the government made some changes that damaged the part of the economy I needed to do well for this gig.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is a great point more people should consider. We should be able to decline interviews like this or be able to ask for our recordings to be destroyed or taken out of the review process after a certain amount of time, 30 to 60 days, for example.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why would you do an AI interview?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Vote with your dollars. Don't buy from mass corps, go to that mom and pop coffee place or restaurant. Get your clothes mended by a local seamstress, don't buy more crap from mega corps.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i like how gen x, millennials, and gen z get along cuz boomers have some superiority complex and they can’t help themselves to degrade and talk bad about the generations after them WHILE living on half a lung.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That’s crazy that you had to remind some people to check the careers page on the companies website as if that isn’t step 1 of basic job applying 101
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I had a hard time finding my first job as an adult and it was the worst experience of my life, so I feel for the kids trying to find their first job. Ask your friends to recommend you for the job! Thats how I got mine after 3 years of futile applications. And dont listen to the older people who own their own homes, they had life handed to them, theyre not like us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Even in career fields where they are more than likely not using AI to screen or interview candidates (i.e. public libraries), the job market is still so oversaturated. Not to mention people who had previously retired re-entering the workforce.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bros using clanker like he fought in the clone wars
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Omg the video at the end and 4:40 took me out 😭😭😭 Also the interviewer AI's starting to interview each other??? What is actually wrong this the US
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hard labor is the most honest and best paying work out there right now. And a lot of the jobs are pretty understanding. Being a retail worker was the hardest job I’ve had, but moving around 50-200 pound boxes for hours has been one of the easiest and best paying.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Orang man bad" wow truly insightful
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 13:03   Millennials don’t generally feel gen Z is lazy. At least I don’t. A lot of millennials knew the whole 9-5 thing and society in general is a scam, but we had no idea what to do about it. Add on the mountains of student loan debt we had to pay back, and salaries rising little by little in the 2010s, and we were just scraping by enough to not make too many waves.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "We only like working with the best or the best, and today.....  That's just not you"  throw's computer out window
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The "i have 3 phds" is so real cause I have 3 4 year degrees and my rejection letters say both overqualified and underqualified. I cant find entry level jobs but anything above entry level wont accept me cause I just finished college and have no working experience 😭😭😭😭😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I work with people receiving county benefits and I manage their work requirements, mostly helping them find a job and get them back on their feet. The amount of jobs that advertise "urgently hiring" and require "open availability" but only give you 10 - 15 hours a week, if that, is outrageous! At first glance, yes, most places are hiring but nothing above maybe two shifts a week. It's impossible to get ahead, let alone stable enough to do more than just survive in today's world
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don’t understand why unions aren’t mandatory for every company if all companies have to be registered with the government 🤔
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I haven't even heard back from fast food restaurants 💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Guy at 14:58 mentioned genz scaring their superiors into accepting mediocre work. To that i say, not even. Gen z is the least unionized generation in history.  This guy is using anti-union talking points.  Thing is, the youth must unionize to human working conditions and salaries that keep up with inflation. When workers are unionized, it keeps CEOs in check!!!

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeah. i've been looking for a job for 3 months now. if my parents weren't looking out for me still (and i'm 28!) i would be homeless.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I applied for a clothes hanging position at a company. I’ve been working at a thrift store for 3 years, so hanging clothes is all I do, pretty much. So the company who wanted someone to hang clothes all day rejected me. They made me do 3 interviews with them, and they still didn’t want me. I give up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hahahaha I applied to an IKEA engineering job, with a cv and I got a rejection email 13 months after I applied. Granted the rejection was directly from the hiring engineer himself, so that did make me feel special.   I applied 2 over 200 jobs when I was freshly graduated and got 2 interviews. I took the first job I was offered because I couldn’t afford to be unemployed any longer which that job sucked so much making me wish I had interviewed for the other company and rejected the first offer I got.   (Still stung cuz I had 2 co-op’s which are 9months long internships where you’re actually doing the job an engineer, and I have 2 degrees with a minor.)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 4:14 so as an elder millennial who graduated just before the recession- I feel this in my heart lol. It was definitely different then dynamics wise, but I absolutely remember (and still feel anxiety from) the slog of over a year when I was looking for entry level corporate jobs and they all seemed to want mad experience. This seems to just be snowballing over time and it blows. 🫠

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What kind of engineering if you don’t mind me asking? Also, was the co-ops a degree requirement or something optional you pursued on your own?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @lustejon   Mechanical Engineering, the co-op's are expected but not required to graduate. My university strongly recommends you take a co-op so they offer a 12 credit course for the semester during your internship for you to stay full-time eligible for financial aid.  Both my co-ops were doing Design Engineering, but other Mechanical Engineering internships could be roles in Manufacturing/Operations, Quality, Test, Sourcing, ect.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hello fellow gen x/millennial or xillennial😂! Graduated in 2008 and got a whole 9 months in a job post grad before getting laid off. Haven't used my degree in a job since
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Marc-y! Tine for another binge (both audio and liquid courage, lol). Is this video gonna make me laugh or cry? Both? Aw, you spoil us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Without any college degree  3:10
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I applied at my job 4 different times over the course of multiple months before I got the interview. And then I got hired on the spot and am apparently one of best employees they have so damn. Should’ve taken my application sooner 💀💀💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Never catch me networking in my entire life 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 14:00 Hey, it’s the who said water is bad!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Loved this video!! I really like ur humor too ^^ gained a new subscriber
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: its kind of nice to know youre not the only one. After a while you start questioning your value, worth and competence
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So I got incredibly lucky to have my job, I graduated highschool in 2019, o was in jr college during the start of COVID. I had to drop out to help the family. I got a job at a local bike shop. Now years later I am working for a big mountain bike company as the head mechanic at our California location. They told me they picked me over others that had college degrees since I  had 5 years of experience. Again I am so lucky to have found a job that I love to do already and now I have lots of connections in the industry.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Man this is so true I graduated from uni with honors in December 2024. Had a fellowship for six months and now haven’t been able to find a full time entry role. I’m doing some volunteer work in my skill sets to not have such a gap (plus hoping it can lead to more networking). I’m going on month 2 now though 😅. Been rejected from coffee shops and retail as well💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i just got my rejection email while watching this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an 18yo who finishes school next spring and wants to study law, despite knowing my family can support me, I am terrified of where this is going.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have this great idea: Trade amongst each other, learn to support each other, shun the ideas that have been shoved down your throats, and let these types of organizations fall.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was in the job market a few years ago with no luck for the longest time. Fast forward to a year ago when I was changing jobs, left everything I had to start my new job, only to get laid off after less than a year. Now it’s back to this purgatory space of job searching. I’m trying all the recommendations that recruiters are giving me, which also slows down my application rate with not even call backs. This shit sucks so bad I hate it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 20:56 hearing someone else go through this is a little reassuring cuz at least I'm not alone. 5 years of management experience in marketing, I was making nearly 6 figures and got laid off with no warning. The company that laid me off is barely hanging by a thread, laying people off constantly.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was recently in the boat for almost a year and I start my first corporate job in a week. I had just about given up, but they contacted me a couple of months after I applied. My advice is just keep spamming with your applications and cast a broad net. Don’t be afraid to sell yourself in an interview. That is the worst time to be modest. Don’t give up you guys! The job market is shitty but don’t doubt yourselves!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Club Penguin Coffee Shop music in the background 😭😭😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: same w/ millennials, I was working retail w/ people with multiple degrees. Feels like 25% of millennials got stuck not working a "real" job. I worked retail at the same place for nearly a decade, trained managers for less than what they were making, and got disabled because I was working May 2020 and got covid twice (I'm disabled now! My t-cells are fucked, MASK UP) and they were giving us .25 cent raises :| It's really fucked up nothing has changed since 2008
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 24:40 I'm a millennial, I did exactly what this guy did and it worked out, and i came into the workforce in full in the last recession. Times are so bad it's actually sound to take risks, I hope things get better, the younger generation doesn't deserve all this BS
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im 32 and faced a slew of layoffs throughout my career, with my most recent one being 16 months of applying to over 1500 jobs. It’s wrecked my finances so bad and I had to move back home because of it. I’m terrified of ever moving out because jobs are so damn unstable. Even the richest companies are laying off in droves.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Starbucks now requires an interview with the local hiring manager, and if you pass, you then have a follow-up interview with the District Manager. If you pass that interview, you may be hired by the local hiring manager. Ummm, excuse me sir……..you are Starbucks! You don’t need all that!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That is a wild statistic. The whole point of getting a degree is to make yourself more marketable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's the only thing I don't feel bad about at this point. Dropped out after my sophomore year, but I have extensive work experience. All of that time I didn't spend wasting on covid online classes, were spent building my resume. And yet--I STILL CAN'T FIND A JOB AFTER ALMOST A YEAR. over ten years of work experience cumulative in office, admin, food, retail, and customer service roles. Apparently it's still not good enough.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ai is cutting into law business. Research deeply. Don’t take on tuition debt.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s impossible for us now we’re so fucked it’s unbelievable
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @JAjaSlippy  it really is, it really really is, you're going to make it though believe that dude
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: whenever I'm feeling particularly burned out from my 3 jobs (1 FT 2 PT because rent and student loans) I read/watch about the job market and feel grateful again. social work is exhausting but the field is always hiring and your bosses are all mental health professionals. I hiiiighly encourage gen z to find a specialized field like sonogram tech or some other random shit, because office jobs are just not it in this economy. yes you may need to incur some debt but I find that preferable to staring down indeed on the daily
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Currently watching this video at work
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 11:43 The trick to this is don’t tell them it’s a workout class. Tell them it’s a personal finance class, GMAT Prep, Bible study, Spanish lesson, etc. Not anything remotely fun or hobby-ish. People respect that more.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am a 40 year old millennial, and I honestly think there is no excuse for how brainwashed so many millennials out here are with their criticisms of Gen Z wanting to have basic work-life balance standards like simply not having to work on Saturday or having to suddenly skip their workout class for an 8am meeting outside of office hours. Sometimes I wonder if other millennials and I even grew up in the same economy. I couldn't get a job out of university for 3 years after applying to hundreds of companies while working shitty restaurant jobs. I had to go back to school and go even further in debt. Finally, when I did get a job 5 YEARS and over $100K of debt later I was able to continue moving forward but even then there was a year when I was unemployed AGAIN. And I have never, EVER, in my life gotten a job by applying through HR. Literally every job I have ever had in my 13 year career has come from an introduction. This has only exacerbated and it is so brutal for Gen Z right now (of course Millennials too). It blows my mind how much other generations have completely lost the plot.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Got a call for an interview watching this😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i'm a 22 year old microbiologist with no degree and i started this job when i was 18 fresh out of high school. it's been 4.5 years of working 10 hour shifts and working every saturday. i recognize that not a lot of people get to have this privilege, and i genuinely think people think gen z is "lazy" because we are so fucking tired of this capitalism bullshit. does that mean i refuse to work? absolutely not. does that mean i would rather be working a job that i actually care about? despite my position, yes. i never liked microbiology and i know it's someone else's passion who could be in this position instead of me. someone who is probably in a lot of debt from going to school in order to get this job in the first place. i shouldn't be working this job, i should be doing something im passionate about. it's hard to care about anything in this cruel world where we are fed brainrot & news every second of everyday. and that is the true cause of the gen z stare. we're all jaded.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: since working hard to do the system right is failing. can we work as hard to cheat the system. and work together please. it shouldn't be an issue if you're all actually experiencing this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the way that asking to not have to have a closing shift on a sunday, because i have physically no way of getting home without the bus, is seen as a personal flaw is fucking crazy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Last thursday, I just heard back from a job I applied for last december. It's been NINE MONTHS.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Interesting the the trades like HVAC electrical automotive plumbing are hiring gen zs from trade schools.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is why I started training to be a carpenter at 17, I don't like it but I'll always be able to be hired.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It took me a year of sending resumés and building my skills to get a job in my career field. The only reason i got my job was luck. Right place, right time, right quals. My old coworkers are still drowning in their positions, barely making enough to stay afloat. I don't feel like I earned it & I hate seeing them struggle
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 26 and am thankful to have a job right now. But…the company I work for is showing signs of layoffs in at least one of the departments that I’ve been hearing about. There is a reorg going on, they’re implementing Copilot, and making the staff take a survey that essentially asks how many hours they’re spending on each task. Basically trying to see if majority of your job can be automated and if they can get rid of you. All that combined is a red flag. The only thing I’ve heard for my department is getting Copilot. I’m doing a presentation on it to introduce to my team and learning it on my own. I don’t want to be left behind. AI is interesting to learn. There just has to be boundaries; just like with anything else. We’ve seen this in the past where tasks get automated and people have to re-skill. This can actually lead to a good opportunity for people. My concern is how companies are handling AI. While they’re saying, “hey, it just frees up people’s time on repetitive tasks and allows for them to do meaningful projects”…they’re still going to be laying off people or pulling tactics to get people to leave. So it’s a mixed bag. I know I can’t control being laid off, but I can control how I adapt to increase my chances of success. Overall, I’m just sorry that younger gen z is getting started during a terrible job market.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z stare😂 you know your generation is hated when literally just DOING NOTHING is still wrong
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bro you look exactly like my friend 😂😂😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Remember that whole "learn to code" slogan? Funny enough, the programmers are replacing themselves and I'm a person who did actually learn to code. It's easy to blame everyone but yourself, but you're the one who went 100k in debt for a useless college major. No one forced you to do that.  You're the one that didn't consider future job growth/relevance, AI and recession resistance when choosing a job.  I'm Gen Z, I'd say learn a trade or join the military if you're stuck.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 13:50 I only put effort into my job because I actually like it and it pays well. They gave me raises with 2 months and I didn't even notice at first. No education and im getting 15 an hour already in a small town. Best job for teens.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Me watching this while having a job I love
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I used to be in school for human services but I am very critical of the industry so let’s just say they didn’t like me and I didn’t make it. The director was an ABA practitioner and heavily endorsed it. Sometimes I feel like I expect people in that industry to be understanding and accommodating, so it hurts more when they are not.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Agree! I’m a young millennial (not from usa) and I got my first job 5 months after graduating from university during pandemic years. And to be honest it also was really harsh. And to get it from the beginning, to keep up, the salary was really low. And I honestly think it shouldn’t be that way. But it is. After 5 years in the sphere now it is getting easier. You know the job and what you’re good at. The salary is ok and 9-5 doesn’t seem thaaaat bad 😂 So I understand these guys
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My dad makes like 100k a year and he never even finished college. I have 2 degrees and I couldn't even get a job in my field. He ket saying I'm not trying hard enough and I have to say no, you guys hardly had to do anything and were set for life. Even when we try hard we barely get a piece. The best job I found was basically being a manager with minimum wage pay and a boss who gaslighted me for saying you can't change our schedules at 3 am for the FOLLOWING DAY OF WORK.  😭😭😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Maybe it isn't brainwashing. Maybe it's ptsd as millennials don't know what work-life balance is. All they know is the fear of not being able to pay bills.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Better to borrow $100k and buy land. It can provide an income.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yep and I have a job and my own place at 25 and no debt, just knee and back pain
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It sounds like we work for the same company.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: you work on what btw if is not bothering you to answer
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a 30-year old millenial, please don’t put us in the same bag as the older generations! We are struggling as much as you, the job and house markets are absolute fucking hell for us too! I live in Poland and here the situation is as bad.   If it wasn’t for my parents, I would be homeless now or even dead. And even though I have a roof over my head, I still feel like a fucking failure.   Even more now, because after over two years, my supervisor told me they won’t extend my contract and I’ll be jobless in about a month. I’m scared absolutely shitless, my family let me live with them and they share food with me but they’re not rich and won’t support a useless freeloader, especially with two cats.  I am in huge debt and I have loans to pay off, I really doubt that I can land a job soon enough with my crippling mental and physical health, I barely function every day, but still, I’ve worked as much as I could.   I seriously have thought about killing myself after getting the news… I feel like an utter failure, I wasted the years when I was still kinda healthy and now I’m trapped. If I learnt to play this rigged game much earlier and made better decision, maybe I could have won this… The only reason that has kept me from committing suicide is my cats. They are very attached to me and I know that my family would give them away, they wouldn’t keep them… I hope this is enough to keep me going but I am afraid that eventually I’ll become so hopeless and desolated that even my cats won’t save me and I’ll kill myself.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Gen Z bro that’s not a Gen Z stare. A Gen Z stare is the stare people do when their brain isn’t processing, when they lack social skills. My sister does this when she’s been her phone for too long, take it away for a week and she stops doing it. As a childcare worker and child development coach, the stare is just synonymous with stunted social growth and it’s mainly down to the parents for raising their children on devices.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here. Welcome to the workforce guys, its going to suck. Just a word of warning. You werent the first generation to see through the scam, we also saw it, or at least some of us. And then it evolved, adapted for us, they made us desperate. They will try to force the same despair onto you, if it will not work, they will adapt it. "Your" overlords are raised/brought up by "our" overlords.   All the good luck to you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sucks because no matter how you vote, billions of our tax payer dollars will still go over seas and these corporations will grow richer than ever while the people fall deeper into despair. This country and the world needs restructuring
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Tbh I dont think these grindset millennials online represent how millennials feel about work culture. Everyone I know around my age thinks gen z workers are badass
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got an Ad for Indeed while watching this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “People just don’t want to work” people on tiktok constantly complain that they’re bored and done with their tasks after maybe 2-3 hours
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I see so much hate on boomers, but you know many of them are out there working to supplement their meager social security.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just turned 20, and have been stuck in my first job for the last 2.5 years, which is in the fast food industry and only pays $13 AN HOUR, and have been misled by my family members into thinking that there are tons of IT jobs around where I live, and that they pay tremendously. Now it's either continue through college and have a useless degree since I don't have the money to move, and I don't want to leave my home state, or switch degrees for a second time, and start over from scratch, and ultimately have to figure out how to move out while in college and sustain myself. I'm fucked.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It sucks because I feel the trauma from all this corpo bullshit is also affecting a group that also tends to be hit badly during economic downturns: small businesses. Here in Canada, my mother has two pharmacies that she has spent years working tirelessly and building from the ground up. She doesn't use AI to assess job applications (not that she would even know how) and has taken on many students and fresh pharmacists. While many of her hires were and are very good she has had some bad apples (especially in the gen z crowd) that has soured her perspective on them (not completely because she has just hired me lol).  She has encountered workers who try to game the system like it were a big name corpo business but the thing is she cannot afford to lose her assistants taking off multiple days of work unannounced and with little context, especially in healthcare. One of her recent hires even started talking about moving to a new job openly, after being hired just a month ago, in which my mom matched the salary she would've been given at the other place. Thsi girl still was not coming into work and not alerting people, even after a week of vacation.  This isn't me trying to place blame on gen z (I'm a gen z too lol and a recent grad) but I have noticed that due to this more harsh work culture, the way gen z is starting to carry the same tactics used in more big corporate venues into small businesses hurts more than helps. I have a friend who works in hospice and shes has told me about absolutely horrific behaviour from new, similarly aged hires who then get surprised that they are laid off. The lack of respect from these bigger companies just creates a cycle where no one respects each other or their jobs anymore, even if they do encounter jobs where they are given some of that respect back.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well make laws to end outsourcing bring factories back to amerca companies dont want to hire americans trying to make a decent wage they would rather build warrhouses and factories in 3rd world countries where they pay them like .25 cents an hour
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 25:25 its adorable that you have hope. They don't have to do anything. They can sit by until there are none of us left to complain.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm sorry but the "squeeze" on the job market is a lie. The whole issue with the younger generation not having children is because they can't support the "Labor market". Our generation was supposed to be able to counteract the job market and increase wages, and now all the sudden every there are no jobs. It's a lie and they want customers to blame the employees. Just tell customers about how corporate won't give you more labor. It's all a LIE  They want you to believe your job isn't safe and you can easily be replaced but that's not actually true. Statistically this is not how this works.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I love how modern retail jobs expect you to be on call without on call pay.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bad news, folks: I’m pretty sure Gen Z is going to work a lot and get paid very little.  - Even now, there are fewer jobs than people desperately looking for them. - I don’t see things magically improving globalization basically threw us into a race against countries willing to work harder and cheaper. - Gen Z will probably end up living at work just to make ends meet, while also covering the needs of an aging population.  And if you’re watching this in five years, please drop a comment and tell me how naïve this sounds to you.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You're not seeing it the big picture on tariffs.. our entire production has been sold out to other countries. America's jobs have been shipped overseas en masse for decades and this is a root cause of the current situation. If you want more jobs, America has to start making stuff again. In order to reset, a lot of the current system has to fall apart because it has been built to maximise shareholder value. By selling your labor to the third world.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My generation not having kids is a little more nuanced than that. Yes, it being expensive is a big factor - but we also just aren’t getting into relationships at the same rate as previous generations. A lot of the women just don’t like the men.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @stephengrant4841  it's a multi-factor problem. We have a cultur war, a wage war, a class war, an ecological disaster going on and the worst political climate ever witnessed going on at the same. Why on earth people would make kids in a climate like that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Side hustles. We are on our own.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bro I was 16 when I realized the best way to get a job is to go there in person, ask to see the manager, shake their hand and introduce yourself, then ask for a job. I’m so serious all they really want is someone who is motivated and has people skills. Do this and you may not get your dream job but you’ll get something. And my advice is to get a sales job. Something like a dealership or high end retail store. You’ll learn valuable skills and make fat commission money
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When in doubt, take the sales route - results define your worth, so prove your value through what you deliver.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "The least resilient generation." Litereally the generation that went through multiple global financial crisis and a pandemic, studied for twice as many years than their parents, and are facing the worst salary-to-cost-of-living ratio in decades. Millennials and GenZ have to be some of the MOST resilient generations to face all of that and keep on fighting!

It's been 2 months now and I can't even find a job or get the run around before being told they're not hiring. I'm literally losing hope because if I don't find a job soon my dad is gonna file for bankruptcy and we will lose everything. SOMEONE PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i’ve applied for close to a hundred jobs in the past four weeks and have had a grand total of two very short very awkward interviews.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I say this every time the topic of jobs comes up; employees need to wake up and realize we hold all the power, if the CEO gets fired another one takes their place, but if every employee stands up and walks out the company goes into panic mode.   start having each other's backs in the work place, 'cus upper management sure don't.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey, Gen Z here. Finally got a job after over a year of searching and basically handing out my resume to the owner of the place in my area. I spent hours every day, filling out applications for pretty much anywhere just to see if I could even LAND an interview. Out of the over 90 places I applied to (probably more since I lost count after a few weeks) I only got one interview, and then they ghosted me even after SAYING they would call me back. One rejection two months after I posted my resume, and then after handing out resumes printed out on paper in bulk in 15 + stores in person, I only got one response back, and it’s where I work now. And I worked almost 3 years in retail before this, so it’s not like I don’t have experience. I can’t imagine what it’s like for kids just getting into all of this with no prior experience. It’s literally hell.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Way less people applying and also there are far more ai generated applications and ats trackers that kick you out the door despite being overqualified. Job hunting is INCREDIBLY frustrating. Incredibly incredibly demoralizing. It is fucking bad bro. And I hate cussing, but this deserves to be.   I have a decent remote job but the worst part is that I had to have a recruiter reach out to me else I'd never have known. To imagine without that recruiter I'd be unemployed rn? Don't wanna think about it man.... and I know people are going thru that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have two degrees in education and was trying to find a remote learning teaching position. I did eventually. But I had to slog through hundreds of applications before I did. It took 4 months to get an interview at my current school and I work in a field that is desperate to hire. There were so many jobs that required a bachelor's but paid fast food wages- or less. Sad state for anyone trying to find a job
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im on my 7th semester of comp science and being told to search for an intern by my university.  I finally found a company that sells wooden floorings and other household needs that needed an IT team. And the very first project i got in my intern is to literally make an ai chatbot to replace their marketing team and my job position 💀

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm still in high school and I want to get a doctorate in marine biology. Partially so I can get a good marine bio job, but also so I can avoid the anxiety of job searching for as long as possible. Unfortunately, the only reason I don't have a part-time job is that I'm volunteering for Key Club and NHS (national honors society, for those unfamiliar).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I literally have a PTSD fight/flight/freeze response whenever I have to sit down and apply for jobs. I’m great at interviews, but the applications are literally traumatizing, and I’m working through it with my therapist (only can afford because my state has universal healthcare). I’m a millennial with a Masters in Business Administration.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Anyone complaining about having to go into work to early aren't realizing the life hack working an early shift is. Or maybe I'm just an introvert.   5am-2pm is the best shift ever. No traffic on the way to work, no traffic on the way back home, if you need to grocery shop the store is empty, doctors and dentists appointments become a breeze, you can still have a social life (especially when your Friday afternoons are completely free), and best of all, the office is quiet for half your shift because normal people don't come in until 8 or 9.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've had multiple cases of job denials and 2 stood out the most was time i applied at subway and the way we talked seemed like id get hired and they even took copies of my personal info like employers have during orientation process just to keep me hanging as i called every week seeing if there was news for some random woman i didnt even know worked there to answer at one point and say im not needed for the position??? Another was just depressing cause i had alot of experience in all fields of work and applied to ever job position in the store...they denied them all and said keep me in mind if they need workers later in the year....I LOST TO CHILDREN AND ROBOTS!!! they seem to mostly hire random teens and replaced half the lines with self checkout! Guy that said he applied to 200 jobs with nothing from it isnt a joke number.....i applied to every job in a 2+ mile radius out of frustration, and got zero job confirmations....some never even contacted me at all, this point might as well act like some families and live life shared household till economy crashes and heals which could end up being 10 years from now like the other depression...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The only job I got that actually paid somewhat well, had me working 12h night shifts so intense I got no time to eat, and literally no time to even get a sip of water. The boss constantly told me I was underperforming. I did my best for 2 years, got hospitalised for heart related issues (duh) and then got fired. If you don’t die at the desk, you’re underperforming.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Damn I get interviews but idk why I fumble so hard. I had a IT job position very simple questions on the interview but I choked up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This has always been the case. I have only ever gotten a job because a friend already worked there, and it’s the same for all my friends, I’ve gotten a ton of them jobs. When I was handing out paper applications back in the day, I never got a call back. Not even from Taco Bell. I have been in charge of hiring and interviewing in years now. The current biggest barrier is HR and recruitment teams gatekeeping for jobs they don’t understand and trying to keep labor hours low for the company. Keep in mind that all these HR and recruitment people earn 3 times what an employee that actually works does. HR has been the problem for decades.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Welcome to Hell" is a massive understatement
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i am 17 last summer i had been working at a supermart store(wont say which on for legal reasons) i had had multiple converations with my squedualling manager abou my squedual and me only being able to work weekends due to school i had been fired for not showing up to a 3 shifts i didnt even know about when i was sick said 3 shifts where on tuesday,wensday, and thursday days i have never worked since school started back up
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i applied to work at my local Ace Hardware, didnt get an email back either times(one was cashier, the other was gardener), then applied for a Holliday and got an interview just for the interviewer to look at me like i was stupid and tell me theyre looking for night shifts only and only have night shifts applications open on their Indeed (it said looking for day, evening OR night positions). i worked in retail from ages 18-20 and they abused the crap out of me and am back in retail at 21-22🙃
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Now that everyone is aware of the serial position effect, everyone’s battling down to the millisecond using bots to be the first to apply and now that everyone’s battling using bots to be the first to apply, everyone’s trying to do some insider applying, trying to know about a position coming down the pipeline and being applied to it before it’s even published, like it’s some kind of stock market bot trading 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: From my perspective, Gen Z seems like a generation of hard-working overachievers trying their best not to get scammed.  Honestly, from what it looks like, Gen Z is starting to seem the most competent generation we've seen in a long time.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Companies replace employees with AI -> Employees don't have an income -> Employees can't buy what the companies sell -> Companies don't make a profit and don't sell anything So how is replacing humans with AI beneficial for anyone? It's a short term money grab

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I still have a job, but spent the last month applying with 10+ years experiencve as a senior architect programmer (basically as good as it gets) and didnt get a single reply to the 50 or so applications I put out.  F** I hope I dont get fired.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got my first job after applying to about 10 positions over a year. I’m really grateful for it and it’s insane to say that because I work 9-12h a day, 6 days a week for 8€ an hour, with unpaid sick leave and holidays, which in my country is basically unheard of. I’m a waiter so at least they feed me for free but that’s about the only benefit.  All my friends are in the same boat, and the ones that are better off work in metal factories with cancerous, toxic equipment. I’m so sick and tired of companies using lack of experience as an excuse to turn us into slaves. Oh not to mention the “we’ll get back to you”ghosting. Applying to jobs requires not having self-respect nowadays

Regardless if it did or not, i got so fed up I just went to the office in person and met with the HR manager face to face. They had no clue I had even applied, said they were interested, then had the AI break the news to me that they would not be moving forward with me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Be ✨self employed ✨ I’ve never been happier
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bro tell me how I applied on indeed. Got the job. Got fired first week.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm not sure this applies to everywhere but one job market I have yet to struggle getting into has been Trades/Blue Collar work, I know people nowadays see it as a "last resort" sorta job but the lessons and independence I have learned working in this field has been unparalleled, just a complete mindset change, I know it's not for everyone and for some it may be out of their comfort zone but I would at least give it a try if nothing else has been working out, if you find the right boss or crew, you won't just be breaking your back for someone that doesn't care about you, you will learn that you may not know how to do something now but you can figure it out, I hope everyone here can find a good job that they enjoy keep your chins up
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I applied to 450+ jobs and finally got one by walking into the store and asking the manager if I could work there; he interviewed me right away and I got the job within seconds. If you're struggling looking for a job, just walk in a store and ask the manager.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: took me 7 interviews to get a shitty fast food job to make a little money while im in college (five at one location, got ghosted, two interviews at a different one finally got me hired)    FOR 16 AN HOUR. TO SCOOP SLOP. this job market is awful

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm now in my third year without a job and i can say its absolutely true. in Germany its the same sh..  i swear i cant do this anymore
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah i dont think i wanna try the ball crusher of a job search anymore
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I went to my states best school and got a computer science degree.  I had 2 internships, was an executive for a club, and did a senior project that we submitted as a research paper and ended up winning best paper at a conference.  Most of us who worked on this paper (we were either high up in clubs, had repeated internships, or one of us was even commencement speaker at our graduation for our giant state school) ended up with internships or employment after college but it was tough. I think each of us did 3-500 applications. Some of us are working internships in hopes of converting but that’s not exactly guaranteed.  Me, I graduated August and I have a really nice job in my field in terms of the experience I’m building but I’m only making 60k a year. It’s totally acceptable but it’s far lower than what’s justified by a CS degree.  However I am holding onto this job for dear life. I had to do 15 different interviews before I found my way into something. The commute is like an hour but I am not moving from my parent’s house because I need to save money.  So yeah this job market is terrible. Even the people who you may “think” are excelling are still dealing with a shitty hand
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am so freaking grateful that I have a job and have had one for over a year now. It’s my first real attempt so I think I’m doing alright :P

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Great video! I'm from Germany and i can tell you it's not just the US we have the same problems here.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I like your video, you are talking about the correct topics and reasons ......
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I actually found a great job on indeed. I have my current job just by going in and asking and repeatedly doing that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah its hell. I was looking for an unpaid internship for 6 weeks so that i would be allowed to write exams at my university, as its a requirement but you can enroll and fullfil it later. Ive heard from people doing 400ish and only getting one through knowing someone. I personally didnt get one after 100 tries. I wasnt able to continue my uni, so i ended up scoring a decent aprenticeship similar to my interests... Now. Imagine i somehow finished the degree and i still couldn't find a job. Its saddening.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here, 7-8 years ago I had the withering experience of applying to hundreds of job postings with only 4 responses and 2 interviews, neither of which I was hired for. This was BEFORE artificial idiot had infested everything, I can't even begin to imagine trying to make it as Gen Z; It's like WW1, you have all been effectively sent into trench warfare with mortars, MGs, chemical weapons, and you have been given training suited for medieval combat.  I applied to more than 50 jobs with my local municipality and I got zero responses across all of them, just getting flatly rejected months later. So I went to law school, figuring that that was my last chance at being able to earn a living. After graduating, I experienced the exact same thing again, hundreds of applications yielding 3 interviews. The first was for a man I immediately clocked as a total con artist slimeball who thought he could pay 20,000 per year if he guilt trips me enough. The second used me for free work. The third was a 70-year old boomer who still lowballed me and was a 1-hour drive, but I recognised that he was an honourable man, and so I took it. The level of protectiveness he has towards his employees is something I have never witnessed: he will scream at a client that dares to disrespect one of his employees. He may be economically out of touch, but he has my loyalty by being the first boss to ever show me decency.  Law can be highly demoralising work, incredibly demanding, and nowhere near as high-paying as people think it is (especially if you don't want to compromise on ethics, life, health, and relationships), but it was my only shot at survival. The battle you're all fighting reminds me of what I went through, but so much worse. I have utmost respect for Gen Z, you are facing impossible odds in a broken system during its last days before total collapse. Don't ever forget the lessons you learn from this struggle and snipe at Gen Alpha, we all need to work together to transform this hellscape into a better place for those who come after us, even if it's too late for us to see it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "No one wants to work anymore"- my hr rep who just told me im only allowed one doctor's note/year and im past the max of 15 absences (i broke an ankle at the beginning of the year and was out for 2 weeks dont @ me) and i should've came to work SICK (I also work IN FOOD PACKAGING) and the only reason im not fired is because they are on a HIRING FREEZE because the tarrifs are costing too much.  This is a factory job that likes to work me 56 hours/week at $20/hr   And no i still cant afford groceries some weeks...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its so true though. My mom keeps asking me why I don't have a job yet when I keep talking about getting a job and saving for the future. I should show her this (but i dont want her asking me what gooning is)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: One thing for interviews is guys you just have to be yourself. Of course still be professional and it does depend on the job but be chatty, give little appropriatly placed jokes. I have always been told that my personality often helped get me the job during the interview as they thought I would be fun to be around. In the 2 interviews I had in the last month both I got the job for. I also accepted the job for both so now I am working 3 jobs as I also own my own business as well which bad timing but of course is good, started growing and getting a lot more orders this month too. Regarding applying for jobs its so irritating I agree. I applied to sainsburys and got to the second interview stage where they said they would call me within the week to let me know when my interview will be. Never had the phone call... even though they promise it. Still getting all the promotional 'working with us' type emails. And every other job I applied to never responded lol.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And why were your working while in college? Couldn't just finish school first?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What you said about management expecting you to bend over backwards for a shit job is real. It’s even harder when you’re the hourly supervisor, or as I like to say the “pickle in the middle.” I am the pickle in the middle at my retail job who’s forced by management to enforce these unrealistic expectations or my job is on the line. I feel bad for them, but I need the job so it’s either write them up or let myself get written up, and you alll know which way the pendulum will swing. Job market is awful and humiliating. I took the retail management job because I couldn’t get anything else, and I am college educated (licensed teacher.) you read that right, no teacher shortage here as I tried for a year. 11 people wanted my current job and I was chosen. I was told that in the past it would sit vacant. That tells you how bad it is out here.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 4:40 Wait... yall starts at 3am? I got till 12pm noon time and I'm still unsure how I'm still here
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a late millennial and I've seen what my Gen Z coworkers go through. They honestly just need a job where they're taken seriously and they can often find their own stride. Mentors seem to be less and less common in places and it's hurting professional development.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm lucky that I have Mom and Dad, and OOD helping with my job search. They are vital for helping me move forward in this cruel job market.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I work as a hiring manager and I agree 100%.   One big issue we have in my company is that most hiring managers don't talk to the departments that new employees would be working in about what new hires should bring to the table and instead let AI generate a completely fantasized and incorrect lists of requirements that new hires should supposedly have.   Then I'm the one getting critized for low hiring numbers during my performance reviews even though if you look at the number of employees I hired that are still with the company 3-6 months later and haven't been kicked out again by their department managers for being a bad, fit I'm one of the best performers in the company and I'm consistently praised for bringing solid candidates into the company.   I'm honestly considering switching companies because of this at the moment. I'd rather get out now than be caught in it when this shitshow inevitably crashes and burns in a few months.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Maybe that’s why I’ve always been able to be hired because I find the company hired on indeed go to the companies website and apply directly from the website
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was laid off from my job jan 31st, im just now, in almost oct about to get another job and im noticing these jobs are paying less than they did even 1 yr ago its crazy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I realize this makes me a unicorn, but I did find a job through cold applying on indeed last summer. I also did the full manual application and worked very hard to tailor my resume, and I probably did get lucky. In general, it really is about doing your due diligence to sort out what’s real and active and what you might be qualified for.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I had a chatbot call me the other day, I definitely hung up on it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: At my job, we just had 2 people with masters degrees apply to be Summer 2026 interns. This is madness. Society has failed young people.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was lucky enough to get a job at a warehouse for 4m4zon but now I suffer from ptsd and severe nightmares of work because our rate is what determines if we get fired or not, and there's always going to be someone slower then another, and thats how they hire so much, because youre constantly fighting to not be fired, and trust me when I say if I get assigned to certain tasks that have terrible RNG (yes, you read that right) for my rate for more then 2 hours out of my 10 hour shift, something beyond my control, the ptsd kicks in from fear of homelessness and not being able to get another job, and I have to do this 40 hours every single week? Christ Jesus save us

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My older brother earned a bachelor's degree in business and a master's degree in artificial intelligence. He's been applying to every job out there for over a year, but has been constantly rejected for either being overqualified or having no experience.   My first job was when I was in college, after applying for 9 months for 8 hours a week. They instead gave me overtime of 36 hours a week without asking me, despite stating I have college classes and homework and requested to lower my hours. They barely lowered my hours, so I still work 30+ hours, including college times. I also found out that every single co-worker there complained about their hours since they were all overworking.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ve got a job right now, but it’s not full time so I’m in the middle of a job search and it is so utterly abysmal and beyond defeating.  I’m a protected veteran, strong academic background, have niche skills for my field, a few years of experience and to find any position that would allow me to afford rent, let alone a house, is literally verging on the impossible.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Rest in peace for me I’m 17 man and this is going to fuck my life over man it seems not even worth trying

Gf is letting me move in, but it definitely makes me feel as a man defeated. I thought it was going to be easy...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: when i was 16 i applied to 20 jobs a week for easily 5 to 6 months before i finally got hired for a summer gig. after that i struggled to find another job SO BADLY to the point that i enlisted out of highschool because i couldnt forsee myself finding stable, supportive work

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I had a great job before Covid and the tariffs happened at FedEx ground as a delivery driver. I worked a lot but I got compensated for it and my contractor and I were getting close and building a friendship. He told me many times I was an asset to him and it showed in my paychecks, I could go at least 6 months at a time without so much as a delivery dispute (those that work in this field know those are constant) and hardly ever would I bring back a single box that went undelivered. Covid hit and threw his business up into the big leagues and my salary increased from 48000 a year to 56000 per year, then the first year of the tariffs happened and suddenly one Christmas killed his entire business he built. He went bankrupt and guess what? I’m now doing a job I hate lifting water tanks well over 150 pounds into peoples basements for 15$ an hour. It’s insulting. And they wanna know why I don’t wanna be here. I can only imagine what the Gen Zers like me that actually have college degrees feel. I’d wanna off myself.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think part of the problem is the “industries” that are being chosen. I work in construction. Every company I work for / with is struggling to find new people. I’m in my twenties, and I am almost always at least 10 years younger than the next youngest employee. Everyone was told college was the way to go (I went too) and now those markets are flooded with applicants. All the “tech-bro, finance” jobs are inflated and nobody wants to touch any industry that requires a bit of physical labor.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's the way that I've thought about enlisting just to get paid 😀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Damn,gen z is so fricking cooked. I am also gen z but for me even tho i hate my job i do tolerate it ,even tho the pay is awfull and i don't like it. Someday i will quit and find what i was looking for . But till then i still have to hang in there for a while and earn my money wich pays my rent and bills.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i was out of work for 2 years, applied to more jobs than i can remember, and i only got hired because i had a connection who had their manager look out for my resumé. they eagerly wanted me once they actually took the time to look at my info, but why did i have to apply 3 separate times before it happened?? i hear my friend talk about how she's applied to like 400 jobs the last few days, and still hasn't heard anything back from the jobs she applied to over a year ago.  she's just stuck in an endless unemployed loop of "apply, hear nothing, apply, hear nothing, apply, get rejected, apply, hear nothing" :(
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I solved this problem super easy, I joined the military
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've lost four jobs since 2019. I was an office manager and the owner moved his office to a different state, one was due to outsourcing, the other to budget cuts and now in Nov I am losing one to AI. It won't be long before we're all living in tents and having bonfires every night. Sharing what food we can and singing old Gospel hymns. God provides and always will.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 18:19. As a 24 year old whos primarily done work in food service, it's very common to have work dress code be all black clothing. It's something Ive grown used to and fundamentally makes sense to me when you desire a neat, coordinated look in your kitchen/dining room. As fortold in the video, my all black clothes are now something that I have plenty of to wear at my new job at Starbucks.  I started right after rhey had reverted back to all black dress code at Starbucks, and I was honestly confused at the outrage. Then I saw red, green, and blue aprons collecting dust in the back of the store and all the years of Starbucks branded clothes that people could no longer wear as uniforms to work. It's not a restaurant, it's just supposed to be coffee.  Starbucks would rather you wear a plain black t shirt made by whomever than have you represent their own merch... All because the shirts blue. That must be why we can't get the vibe right at Starbucks, all the dang blue shirts. No longer interested in this yap
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: One year laid off couldn't afford my lease anymore. Living homeless for a while but honestly I feel better than crying everynight in my bed feeling like a failure not having a job
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Anyone else getting scam likely calls on their iPhone all day?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Jobs can still be found nowadays (although quite hard), but the real problem is employers & HRs will milk you out as MUCH as they can by giving you a large job scope while paying you the lowest as they possibly could.  They'll even test your naivety in your early days of employment.  If you're quite naive and they can milk you out while paying you cheap, they'll want you to stay, even calling you as a "company's family member".  If you're not that easy to be manipulated, have a strong principle and able to stand up for yourself, they'll make up any excuses to get you fired.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 15:20 how the fuck do you come to that conclusion 😂😂😂😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The goal will be to live in a caravan instead of a house.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: recently 23, i had a minimum wage job that was already cutting hours and shut down in 2024 and ive been applying to jobs ranging from mc donalds to construction(i also work gutters but theres no work right now and hate to say it but as a girl you get rejected a lot) ive been applying since 22, recently turned 23 and im either getting no replies or rejection after rejection and to me its embarrassing to still live with my parents at 23 with no job and no money. Was studying criminology, had to put classes on hold because i literally cannot afford it and to top it all off my phone was also recently stolen(thankfully getting one this week) which is a bigger pain in the ass since its a REQUIREMENT, also applied to hardware stores, showed up IN PERSON multiple time only to never hear a response back its actually ridiculous. This is gonna sound harsh but when all these boomers die, I feel the job market is gonna greatly improve bc honestly idk what else they wanna see, i have certifications and 5+ years experience but they really only wanna hire either older people, people they know, or insanely overqualified people
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 9:40 in regards to this, interviews for anything programming related almost always have dumb puzzle questions that are entirely unrelated to what you will be doing or what you have learned, so using ai to cheat this is actually one of the few acceptable uses of ai
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am MISERABLE at my current job. I am a lawyer with three master's (one of them currently ongoing) and I haven't been able to break into law yet. I'm working in sales. I want to find a job where I can develop my lawyer career but the job market is hell. Job applications take 15 mins each because for some reason they want me to upload a CV in pdf, a cover letter AND then log all the info that was already in my CV manually into their system. Wtf are we doing here? I am not even joking, I'm close to breaking down.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What’s hilarious to me, is that finding a job is like mentally torturing yourself while trying to find a needle in a heys tack. The older generations call us entitled and lazy but how tf are we supposed to find jobs when you ask for a position and don’t hear back for like…3 weeks??   Also, me personally, I’m terrified to start working. 1 because I suck as at money, 2 because people are rude and I can barley handle my parents giving me the cold shoulder and 3, working now actually SUCKS.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ll say this. I’m apart of gen z and I got a good paying job, but I know that it’s hard out here to find work. The best thing I could say is to play naive. It’s wayyy better to just do what they ask and cry about it later. Whether it’s your boss or a customer. I always hated hearing my foreman or journeyman tell me something I already know how to do. Literally every single person in power would rehash the same teaching, but the last thing you want to do is be a know it all, especially if it turns out you don’t actually know how to do it the way they want it done. It looks incredibly bad on you. I’ve gained the skills of a builder. I can break down any thing and figure out how to put it back together, but every company has a different way of doing things. Just do them. If a customer wants you to check for a different size pants in a thrift store, go to the back or half way and tell them, “sorry, we’re all out of stock.” We all need money so we need to stop putting our pride in the way so we can at least have something when the recession does happen. Otherwise start YouTube or any streaming platform and be your own boss.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: have a law degree from a good uni, couldn’t find work after covid (understandable) but 3 years later when i did finally find a good job again, i was made redundant within 4 months. now im back to looking for work 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How i got my job was from a job i had applied to 5 months prior off of indeed, then they suddenly reached out to me and asked if i wanted to come in for an interview. Now I've been working there for about a year. I applied to hundredddds of jobs and this was the only job that genuinely showed interest. Very thankful for my job, but it was ridiculous even finding it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is why I'm so glad I went to trade school. I'm now an electrician. Never been out of work for more than a week. Been laid off twice and it's never hard to find a job, somebody is always in need of help in this industry.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I can count on 1 hand the amount of jobs I have applied for in the past year where I actually got an interview. Even MCDONALDS of all places don't seem to be hiring even when I get those Chat-GPT looking e-mails saying they are apparently "Always hiring." As an Aussie though, I am glad that Centrelink exists so that I can scrape by to some extent.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got the job I have now on indeed, I think most places I’ve worked were from there, and I LOVE my job. I applied in June and didn’t start until August… literally had forgotten I applied to them along with the 150 OTHER PLACES
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The only way i've been able to get a job is literally walking into businesses and applying in person. All these online applications are total garbage.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My dad was in danger of losing his IT job. He’s in his mid 50s now but I was super worried he wouldn’t have been able to handle today’s job market. Of course, with AI’s filthy grimy paws getting a strangle hold on most everything, I fear it’s only a matter of time
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The notion that gen z fakes mental illness is not moronic lol it’s true. “Anxiety” (natural human nervousness about something) is their overused excuse for everything. They’ve been convinced that being nervous about something like  a test is abnormal  and unmanageable. The fact that faking dissociative identity disorder and Tourette’s became popular trends on social media proves that gen z does in fact do this. No other generation has done something like that and it makes sense why. The idea that mental illness should be addressed with understanding and destigmatized in the early 2000s, and celebrities started getting attention from being open about their struggles, which taught gen z that claiming mental illness could be a “get out of jail free card” that would also provide an “interesting” identity marker and some attention or victim points.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And in regards to the talking, corpo speak is so robotic and meaningless that one might as well just automate it. Corpo speak is the issue there, not the ai
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And this is hoping that the job offer IS for real, because many of them are scams. Or the company is just looking, not really hiring at the moment. I HATE it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Lol having mental illnesss isnt a benefit and it doesnt count as a "get out of jail free card" because nobody takes it seriously even if they act sympathetic. Its pretty moronic because people like you find every reason to brush off the mentally ill as "young people faking it" which is what exactly happened with gen X, and we all saw how they ended up turning out. Kinda funny how taking mentally ill people seriously actually benefits them more instead of brushing them off as a "gen z thing" lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I dropped out my junior year.  I have a full time job making over $20.  I just knew the one right person. It all comes down to who you know.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Tip for anyone looking for a filler job. Getting a Level 2 security license is SUPER cheap and easy to obtain. Most big companies like Allied Universal and Intercon security are always hiring and it’s pretty easy to get a job with them. Do that while you wait to find a job in the career you want. Overnight security is the easiest fucking job on the planet and in most cases you can just do other things while you’re on shift, I watched the entirety of the first season of squid game when I was working my shift with intercon security. Seriously, this is an unused meta in the job market. I’m able to find security jobs and get interviews with offers within the same week of applying.   The devs haven’t patched this yet as of 9/29/2025, but this meta might get nerfed later on  In my area - Allied Universal is paying 19-22/hr starting pay, for level 2 work and their starting pay for level 3 work (prior law enforcement or military required) is 26/hr.  Again this hasn’t been patched by the devs but might get nerfed later on
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: rate with college degree is same as with college degree? huh?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The funniest thing is all the job shaming my parents are doing to me now for working at a warehouse is their attempt to make me go through the hell this video is talking about under the “we just want you to be happy” guise. Guys, don’t fall for it. Office work is shit, any trade is better, and if you happen to be like me and find a job that pays you well, has great benefits, no real issues from your fellow coworkers or upper management, don’t think you need to “do better” because someone who’s not living your life told you to. We all end up burrier in the same ground, destined to be forgotten when the people who knew us in life die too.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: my boyfriend is currently in college and has been able to get an internship at an investment bank. the only way he was able to get this internship is not because he applied the normal way, it was because he worked 50+ hours a week not including his course work to network with people and this guy decided he liked him enough (and looked at his resume). he applied normally to 100+ internships for this upcoming year and he’s only in the later stages of 2 and been denied or ghosted by all the others. this is with INTERNSHIPS, not even JOBS. we are getting married at the end of the college school year with money that i’m making from my part-time job and hopefully the money that he will be getting from his future internship. either way, we still are going to need help from our parents in the first few years. and we’re getting married now because otherwise we’d have to wait another three years and we’ve already been dating for about that time. it sucks. it feels like i can’t start my life unless i have “daddy’s money”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have been applying to jobs for well over a year now. I have only gotten 2 interviews, and I was told I’m overqualified for the positions.  I’m a line cook.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Saying no to a work meeting when you just started for a workout class is ridiculous. Sometimes certain meetings need to be scheduled outside of your regular schedule. I'm 30 and thank God have had the same office job since I graduated. But like c'mon if it's so hard to find a job nowadays, just workout after work or skip your workout lol. It's not like they asked him to work a double shift or something
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ive always used indeed to get my jobs, every where has scams just do your research when you applying and ignore the scams
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah the job market is complete ass right now. Im an old man in my 30s and i completed college later in life. I have lost count of how many jobs i have been rejected from after completing interviews/presentations at this point. Most of the time they dont even call me back. This shit blows.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm nearly 30 and applied for over 60 jobs in the past three months alone. Over half of them just ghosted me at some point lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 19, Currently working at Wendy’s. When I started working there we were getting a free biggie bag at every shift, then it became only on breaks, then it became sell 3 of x,y, or z (extra stuff like cookies) and then you can get food and now my boss is out here playing games saying “you can only get free food if you sell a number of xyz that really impresses me, but you’re not allowed to know that number” why would I work like I wanna be there when I’m getting 4 hours a week, $10/hr and you took away the only benefit of working fast food
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yk what is it that every one think they can just walk out and just find  another job some times you gotta do what you don’t like it’s life
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: listen to this… i was told i was too OVERQUALIFIED for a position. Never skipped a beat getting a job though, just a stupid reason that i didn’t get a job i applied for.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I live in a country where six day work is legal, have done a lot of bad 9-5 that have ruined my physical health, unpaid 13 hour shifts only to be laid off without being told why. Now, I had the chance to finish college but to get my degree I have to do unpaid work, 9-5, 5 days per week for 6 months. I have no hope and no dreams, keep getting yelled at on the daily and do tasks that are not even part of my job. We are cooked.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've applied to quite a few jobs since last year, but since I'm also at college (UK based and fully funded because of the tism) I don't have the energy for a job with long hours. I can't find ANY part time jobs near me, like anywhere. The most I think I could do are an hour's drive away, and I don't drive, and my mum doesn't want to drive me that far. I'm absolutely exhausted because I have no money, my family already lives in social housing, so they have no money, and there's absolutely nothing I can do. I have a volunteer position as a dishwasher that I haven't been able to make since the start of term because of how tired I am after my course, and I don't know what to do. I don't think I'm ever going to make any money.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Boutta start a homestead community with friends and family and live off the grid at this point LOL we love it here...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As someone who lives alone and again is kind of out of my main job and only part time, i am thinking of developing some skills but at the same time yes the worry of not getting job js huge . I’m already in my mid 20’s so I would obviously worry that it’s getting late for me. Despite of failing badly in college ,  I still want to see if I can retry any of coding or anything like that… And it’s going to be really worse for me I agree with a comment that once said we’re always close to being homeless or disabled than we’re closed to being rich. I am doing so,what fine but not everything lasts long  If I fail in learning to code or anything again then I’m doomed. I mean I’m here watching YouTube instead of doing anything related too

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: my favorite reply from a company was them replying to my application over three years later asking if I wanted to reapply and interview and do everything again.... ah yes let me bend over backwards for a company that ghosted me for over three years.... I am over those gatekeeping boomers. there should be no reason with a masters, a bachelors, a certification year long degree, and two internships shouldn't land me at least an entry level or mid level job js but their new gatekeepy thing is to tell you to your face that internships no longer count as real exp........ Bud I cant pull myself up by my bootstraps when you have stolen them and lit them on fire in front of me roasting marshmallows and making smores on the flames.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Finding a job at 14 in Finland is actually easier than finding a job with 20 degrees
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 10 years of experience, I'm still technically in that age bracket sweet spot that employers rave about as being the peak of efficiency and ambition, 6,000 job applications, 4 interviews, and no offers. It's been two years. This entire job market is a joke. I will never be able to get another job in this country ever again. My only hope is to leave the U.S. at this point and that isn't even a guarantee but at least if I go somewhere that has universal healthcare, I'll finally be able to see a doctor. I hate it here.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I once applied for a cleaner job at a nursing home and only recieved the rejection fout months later…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is why I started my own business. Im not going through looking for jobs and I quit my old job cause even though it paid decent it was not worth it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​I work for a Japanese manufacturer. My monthly salary is about $6,000 USD (with my company fully covering my rent). While my income isn't exceptionally high, I'm glad I was able to get this job despite having a low level of education. The best part is the manageable workload—I only have about 10 hours of overtime per month, so it's a comfortable environment. I'm really glad it's not a harsh, "Spartan" environment like in some American companies.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Internships are also doing this crap too. I am regretting my business degree. They intervew you and then ghost you sometimes too . That should be illegal some colleges make an internship mandatory for a credit need .
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im a process manager. With a couple years of experience and a masters and I still cant find another job.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: well, I made the mistake and chose the wrong degree and was not the brightest student anyway, and got unemployed. Then I went to adult certification course  to become a sterile processing technician (clean, pack wrap sterilize hospital instruments). Got a summer job and when it ended the boss called me! and asked when I could start.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have bachelors, I have masters with honors  I also have no job. Super grateful that my family puts up with me still living with them but I feel like a leech.   Job market wants so much. In my specialty, all applications are for senior positions, for people with 7 years of experience. I can't appy to those. Meanwhile when I apply to a more regular job, I genuinely hear that they dont want to accept me BECAUSE I have two degrees and would start to demand more, move on to another job, etc.   Univeristy is a scam, people. It does not help whatsoever unless you study law or medicine

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got extremely lucky I got a job on indeed. A new cleaning company started near me and they saw my resume and reached out to me. I probably applied to 200 jobs and got 1 interview during that time which is sad that my experience is considered good compared to other job searchers.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a Gen Z hiring manager, and there were no misses in this video. It's such a disheartening environment and all these hiring platforms shove AI down our throats even on the recruiters side.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I had a job interview for a cleaning gig, they went through the entire interview before telling me that they wouldn't hire me because I have too much experience. So you're telling me that you need people badly but won't hire the only person that has applied, and I'm not even asking for a higher wage.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im a Millennial. didn’t work during 2020 due to Covid like many of us then took care of my disabled father up until his death in 2022.

Janitor, McDonalds any fast food joints & Walmart at this point! but I never hear back.. unlike Genz my schedule is OPEN, screw my yoga class I will do backflips & jump thru hoops! My Boomermom is telling me to go back to school but I can’t get her to understand what does putting myself $10,000 into College Debt for a Job field who Still NOT hiring will help?  A.I is going thru our job application are denying us over keywords…   I have seen “help wanted signs” in windows so I applied for the job but I don’t hear back? Because they are Not Actually Hiring! They want to overwork the employees they already have & make them Think “hey we are trying to hire more staff but NO ONE WANTS TO WORK ANYMORE”🤷🏻‍♀️ Ya we learned that was a lie a longtime ago. I want to work, I want a job. I need a job…

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Applied for a job on indeed called “wedding dress making, sewing workshop, art students wanted” Tell me why I look them up and it’s an independent car parts company.  I went to the interview (yes I was that desperate) and the position was actually making carbon fibre molds for car parts. I asked why they mentioned dresses in the application, the boss proudly looked at me and said “ah yes, I ask my employees to simply make a dress for our cars”.  I left after a month, it was the worse job I’ve ever been in

I’ve been there for three years now and the only way I’m leaving is if it shuts down or I get fired. I’m not fucking with the job market
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I can't process much more. I honestly feel so overwhelmed by all this. There are too many things to think about at once. Im losing my fucking mind. I dont know what's real. I dont know what's worth working for.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i'm extremely lucky. even with all the other terrible shit going on in my life because of _recent events_, i have a job that pays almost 50% more than most people in my same position in the area. but even still, it doesn't have anything to do with any of the skills i actually pursued higher education for. i couldn't afford college, so i went to trade school for 4 years to learn cybersecurity. after hundreds of applications and a couple interviews, i finally got one offer for a decent salary, and i thought i'd finally be able to get my life on track- but guess what? the next week, i learn they rescinded the offer because upper management "restructured" the department (gave everyone else a piece of the work i would have been doing.)  i once got fired in the MIDDLE of a work day at a $14/HOUR job because management told me straight to my face they "couldn't afford the expense". mind you, i was handling paperwork for dozens of contracts daily for them, each one worth anything from $30,000 to $300,000.   yeah, america is totally great again, guys. it's totally working. 💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 😢 I’ve been applying since 2013😢
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think a lot of genZ got depressed realising it’s impossible to get a job or to work with people who hate every reaction you have. Like I had my boss telling me I was complaining too much after I made a joke about me not willing to make a report. Like she asked me “hihi haha do you want to make this” And I said no as a joke. She ended up making it herself because SHE HATES asking for help I thought well it’s an important report she’s being caution. 3 months later during a feedback she tells me I’ve been being uncooperative for saying no to help her? This is the same woman who got interviewed for a big magazine for our company and said as soon as she was back to the office that the questions were stupid and that she obviously do that job for the money. So she gets to joke about not giving a crap about the job and say she loves money but me who genuinely would have love to make the report (it’s actually a project I wanted to do) get labelled as lazy because I said no when she said if I wanted? Who wants to work? Nobody. But we all know we have to. So yeah if I see everyone joking in the office about not willing to do X why can’t I? And if I do it once I’m being seen as lazy? And ofc I tried to explain but she hates being wrong so she was getting defensive I had to shut up and say it won’t happen anymore. And this is again the same woman who ask me to come on the weekend but as the head of the department she doesn’t come all weekend bc her husband argue with her because they don’t spend enough time together? Everyone come during the weekend but her. She “jokes” the most in the workplace. Nobody likes her. But me going her way once it’s a nono.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 25:18 while raising the minimum wage is tempting and seems obvious, it just causes companies to increase their prices to compensate for the increased price of workers, leaving you with no more purchasing power than you started. also, universal healthcare means higher taxes for you, not just the ultra-rich.. which means spending more money.. I agree with you on everything up until economics, but I think you should look into this particular section a bit more
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Heheee. Haha. Too real. I applied for a job and had an interview 11 months after. I got the job tho!  What I’ve seen is that the white collar work force has been decreasing by a LOT because companies are trying to cut costs where ever they can. I worked corporate for 7 years. Our fleet of front-line workers for our account went from 12 to 6, then 6 to 3. THREE people covering 6 ginormous sites. My job was never threatened because I was the only person who knew how to do billing for the entire nation of the account. I also have no college education (too poor at 18, but am now in online college) and am massively under-qualified to do the work of a senior accountant. I  still did great though, I have all the quantifiables. My pay though? 46k a year. In a city. I couldn’t afford to live on my own (thankfully live with long term partner but gd). I got a city govt position as a typist doing work that is much less mentally demanding and I make a lot more. I helped our CFO with excel conditional formatting and have automated so much of my job already with macros. Now I’m over qualified 😃
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Doing nothing makes me feel like a waste of resources, if I didnt have a job id probably kill myself or try to start a company. Not having a job and doing nothing is ABSOLUTELY a strain on me. Im 25. We aren't lazy, exponential growth isn't realistic. There's a ceiling for everything a plateau is natural. You can only push humans so far, you can only get so much value out of things, you can only increase the value of things so much. Infinite value doesn't exist. Shareholders and old fossil people don't understand that. If they do they're pretending they ddon't.we just gotta outlive them peeps. We'll bite the bullet so our kids wont have to. We'll do what our parents are failing to do. We have to. Id never let my kids go through this. This sucks. I'll throw myself under a bus for my kids (assuming I had any, who's got money for that)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You look like the king of hearts ♥️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So weird in the job world I work in the construction industry and the pay is amazing and jobs are abundant I would struggle not to have a job by next week if I left my job is there not some form of issue of everyone trying to do the same job my whole industry doesn’t have enough people so this employment crisis always baffled my brain
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but when you guys do actually find a job, it will Almost 100% certainly do nothing but suck your soul out of your eyeballs and leave you miserable and tired and wonderimg why you just cant, live out your own dreams...at all...welcome to hell kids.  and its gonna last, the rest of your lifes. Oh and also it will never pay you enough to buy a house or start a family. oh!!!  Just wanted to throw that last part in there right quick... before I forgot it. It will also not compensate you well enough to ever be able to buy a home, property or start a family. Meanwhile, the whole tariff thing that they're doing, that would be fine if they canceled the income tax but to have tariffs and income tax makes it no good for us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Xer here.  Some of us have always been able to identify a job scam,  and we said "nah!".  Some of us are living extremely simply, and sure, it's not easy.  I was never able to fake enthusiasm for corporate BS.  I teach part time, and am a full time carer for a parent with dementia.   Sending love and support to all the Gen Zs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Crazy how the top 2 job options here in india is doctors and engineers which are the few fields which will always be in demand and not be mostly compensated by AI. Nobody complains about 9-5's here
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I´m so so grateful that in my country (Czech republic) are job seekers (especially with a university degree) really rare. Employers usually give you the job immediately, the interview is usually just to persuade YOU to take the job. And then they treat you so nicely - for example the lunch break should be 30 mins long, but everybody takes an hour and it´s ok. Also at my job (a district court) we have 6 weeks of paid vacation. If you are sick of USA, come here :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Some employer actually hired an inexperienced high school grad and pay them?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh my god bro i went through highschool and elem and you're still that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well who's forcing companies to raise their prices? They're only doing it because they believe in keep making these ridiculous high profits and can't be nice. If they usually make $90 billion a year but after these higher taxes/wages now they only make $45 billion, okay sure you lost profit but isn't $45 billion still a lot?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @jonathanf2392 thanks for your reply. As you just described, the big companies are doing it out of greed. You can't remove that, it always exists, I hate it too. Most companies don't make an insane amount of profit, and cannot afford to pay employees more without tanking the business (or upping their prices). Factor in supply and demand balancing the prices again, and we're still broke. That's why I disagree on increasing minimum wage.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you go in person to get an application 9/10 they tell you online and apply.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Currently work as an HVAC apprentice and am going to school for Accounting. Starting to have second thoughts about continuing School all things considered…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i didn't know abt this   i havent had much trouble
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i'm 19, i tried to get a job working as a parking lot cleaner from 2am-10am on the job post it says "highly recommend people with criminal records" i'm 19 no criminal record and they said "sorry you don't fit the job"... bc im not a criminal? i mean they are paying 18/hr to work for 8 hours picking trash off the floor wtf how am i not a match
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ahh i remember after every interview i had- i told them “you’ll tell me if im getting hired or not, right?” i didn’t care if it was a no. i just wanted to be informed. nope. even after they said they would no call. and yes, many many applications just reject you. i took one of those indeed tests you HAVE to take during application and immediately was rejected. i hope someone knows what i mean. 🙂👍
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Blame the shareholders and stock market. A company NEEDS to show growth every year, or else the shareholders will demand change. This means cutting production costs, raising item prices, and spending far less on employment opportunities. Deadlines become tighter, and there becomes a shortage of workers, meaning the extra workload is put onto the few that are still employed. This also causes managers to squeeze as much productivity as possible out of those beneath them on the ladder (however they themselves are often pressured.)  So if you get hired, you're going to be overworked and undervalued by the company. Nobody wants to work in a situation like that, and they definitely don't want to do it if they still struggle to feed their family anyway.   And this wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't a race to the bottom
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a 38 y/o millenial with a high schooler who has been looking for work for over a year now. Their resume has been reviewed by a "professional," they've followed all the "correct" rules for applying for jobs, and still nothing. What the actual ****!! I looked for work for 8 years before I found my job and I have two degrees, how on earth is my child going to find work??  If there's anything I've learned about Gen Zs from parenting one, it's that the media spouting all these derogatory rumours about Gen Zs have never actually met one or loved one. Every Gen Zer I know (including several I work with!) are extremely self aware. They show concern for the future and are conscious about the lack of control they have to make change. It's really sad. We need to stop treating the next generation as selfish, lazy teenagers! Gen Zs will make the changes they want to see in work-life balance and mental health, and if we want to see that change we need to give them a chance!   I hope some day you guys can find a spot and prove to the world that you're better than whatever is going on right now.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As someone with like half a decade of barista experience i got rejected by STARBUCKS and knew this generation is cooked.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hate how an entire generation of people are grouped together as people who have terrible work ethic and aren't skilled or mentally capable enough to handle the stress of learning the job. I am a 25 year old who was taught by my parents to have a good work ethic and I try my best to learn as fast as I can and do the work to the best of my ability. I can understand why so many young people these days are trying to be their own boss, however that is possible. I fortunately have a stable job but I feel so bad for people who are searching for a decent job that can allow them to afford the cost of living
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People sure seem to prioritize this career thing. Meanwhile I care about happiness and finding a job I would do because I want to.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My brother’s got an insane resume, including volunteer work where he ACTUALLY has saved people’s lives. He’s been on Job Seeker support for over a year now, and applies to 10 jobs a week. Even jobs below his level won’t take him.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was working at Anthropologie where the dress code said I couldn’t wear tennis shoes with jeans so I just stopped wearing jeans to work. And I got so many comments on my nice outfits from my managers followed with, “But why don’t you wear other kinds of shoes?” You know, for a job that requires me to walk around all day with only a 10 minute break? This past week, they sent out an email telling us that from now on, if your tennis shoes don’t match your outfit and aren’t “fashion sneakers”, you would be sent home to change. Good thing I found a full time job and was able to quit just in time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think it’s time to escape and get to building my  own house in the woods and propagating a garden instead of buying groceries, maybe then I won’t be a hamster on someone else’s wheel but on my own, without having to be controlled by wages and fear 🧚🧚
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I applied for a virtual interview and got stood up for an hour then I called the store and had a minute conversation with some random cashier I assume, who did my interview over the phone and within about 6 hours I got a rejection letter and I got dressed and tried really really hard for a cashier job
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Even IT is struggling much... I am working there, not making so good money, and I am about to take courses in electricity to put cables in houses or to fix something.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Does this count as studying for my con exam 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Between march to beginning of august i put in over 140 applications until finally getting hired. While at work two weeks ago i got a call for an interview for a part time entry level job i applied to 4 months ago. Let it be known i have 3 years of experience including manager experience
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I also hurt my knee while on vacation and had to call out last Monday because I woke up being unable to walk on it. I called two hours before the store opened and my manager just said, “I wish you’d told me sooner.” It was 8am.  The store doesn’t open until 10. When my other manager confronted me the next day, she reminded me of the policy to call three hours in advance. When I told her I called as soon as I woke up, she told me I needed to wake up three hours before my shifts so I can assess how I feel and call out accordingly to “help the team.” Absolutely insane
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: terrifies haven't messed up the job market, people have to be hired to deal with the legalities and processing of this. working for people isn't in the policy of the current regime. working for yourself is. furthermore, if working not for yourself is the path you want to follow, throw morals and authenticity out the window and cheat. im in college right now and as a business major, ultimately all im learning is how to cheat, lie, steal, and take credit. adapt or die
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im still getting automated rejection emails from jobs i applied to almost two years ago.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I understand that everyone needs a job to pay for their bills and expenses. Also, it is traumatic not getting a job after all the time you have invested in your resume and applying. But we need to be focused on building our own businesses and multiple streams of income. We need to be focused on selling by identifying market needs.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 3 months, 400+ applications, 4 interviews and one callback.   From Walmart.  And I had to spend a literal hour talking to a clueless hiring manager and explaining that I can’t start shifts at 5am because the first bus runs at 5:30 and I live across town, it takes me an hour to get there. Their reply was “well you have a college degree right? How come you don’t have a car?”.   MFER IF I COULD AFFORD A CAR I WOULDNT BE APPLYING TO WORK AT WALMART!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The craziest thing is that it's not happening in only one country. It's around the world.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How much better would society be if HR never existed.

I’ve got a pension, an annuity, and full healthcare. This job combined with some good money management has allowed me to have a net worth over $130k and absolutely zero debt at 21.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When I was job searching, I applied for a job at FedEx, got rejected by their automatic screening system. Then I get a text literally, not joking a year later asking il I was interested
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If it's not telling that im drunk idk what is because last night I couldn't sleep till 4am, 5 even because we were almost out of heavy cream at my job at that coffee place. I closed, and last night I told them that, cuz they tell us that essentially when we "communicate" about inventory when we find out about it, it essentially means we didn't tell them shit. So hearing all of this made me cry while laughing at how ridiculous all of this is. And OF COURSE THEY DIDNT SAY ANYTHING TODAY BUT I CANT EVEN ENJOY MY DAYS OFF BECUASE OF COURSE I HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH WORLD AND LOCAL NEWS IT REMINDS ME THAT I GOTTA GO TO WORK TOMORROW, SO HEARING IM NOT ALONE DESPITE FEELING HOPELESS IS AT LEAST COMFORTING
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My current job i have cause my mom ordered take out pizza and they happened to just lost some employees bro i didn't have a job for a year before that its bleak. I just got lucky they were urgently hiring when i asked if they were, which i did basically anywhere i went, (i stopped using online stuff after an ai scheduled a job interview for cracker barrel during breakfast rush on a Saturday, where i got turned away at the door) Hopefully I can start school soon cause i actually know what i want to do at the ripe age of 21 going on 22
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Reality is you work however the company you're under wants you to work, but exceed expectations. Your opinion on how fair it is or what you had to do to get the job doesn't matter, it's how much you provide to the job. No point in whining about it, it is what it is. Success is hard.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: After 500+ applications I finally got hired for an apprentice position with zero experience (company knew I had no experience) and got fired a week and a half later for not having enough experience

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: At just 21 years old? Wow, must of had some personal connection or past experience before
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1. A big tip is applying for a job way before you need the job. Sounds insane but bc the hiring process takes long and there a a lot of “no” it works.  2. To the college students…intern during your summers. Do go back home and work at a local grocery story. Intern at the company you want to be hired by, intern at a diff company to gain skills and connections.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen z I've had to recently get my doctor to clear my back disability (due to being a sponsor for my partner you have to be working)as after 10 years in trades I lost my job from an injury, unable to lift from ground level more than 10kg now have a permanent disability. The visa process in Australia can be reviewed whenever and if you don't meet all 4 requirements by the time they decide to review whenever they want within 18 months you have to reapply which is 10 grand! After 10 years working I have nothing to my name but a broken body, always forced to work as I've never met the criteria for Centrelink amd never any savings to go study, currently 6 months into a 12 month course but will have to pull out to go back to being a trades assistant with my long list of health issues because I can't get a desk job or a supervisors role after at least 1000 applications, I've only gotten calls and recruiters downloading my profile asking if I can come work as a trades assistant or know any tradies to work which I've said some colourful words to. I want to work but not as a labourer but I have no choice.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 9-5? Ive never worked a job with shifts that short.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: in the grand scheme of things tariffs did nothing, at most 3% of a upcharge on some necessary things on average, tariffs didn't create ghost jobs, or increase ceo wages by 80% more than the average job wage, or make housing and car prices cost the equivalent to 3-9 years of full time work. it added a little to the fire with the intention of forcing more real jobs in the country, and it seems to have worked, just things are not even close to catching up yet, never mind every ceo/shareholder trying to squeeze more money out of every little thing without trying to sell to more people.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also, not true about you want to be the first one to apply. I’m an HR and if a position gets A LOT of applications, I usually start sorting from the most recent ones—that’s just how the website works. And I usually don’t remember the first ones I read… I remember the valid ones.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I applied to a government job in 2023 and got a denial 3 months ago.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I thought that internet applications for a job were just an addon to the HR but is actually not that hard to spam someone that have the power to hire you in a company.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Go to the trades, they would love to have you all.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s a nightmare out there I’m millennial I have a job but I’m looking to move to a different company. I5 years experience in my field I sent out 10 applications never heard back from one. You really need an in to get anything good.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: NO! Employers that uses websites use algorism to detect key word to show if you are using proper wording to see if you are the right person for that position. I remember when I interviewed a Gen Z, he showed up in shorts.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: try being in canada. i was fresh out of high school with a 3 year long resume (lived and worked in the US for most of my life) and couldn't even get hired at WALMART OR TIM HORTONS 😭 the only reason im employed in retail now is because of a family friend
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is why it’s important to earn skills after high school. If you have skills that are in demand, you’ll always have a job. Colleges have resource centers to help navigate you on where you need to go, so I think it’s wise to use them. I get it, when I was 18 I didn’t take this seriously but now that I’m 29 continuing where I left off, I realize just how important it is to use resources that are provided for you to help you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The sad thing is, the people power won't do anything because they're all rich and profit from how much worse things will get
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i managed to get a first job, unfortunately i cant keep it because of physical reasons. now im a bit worried if i can find something else that will take me knowing i have this new diagnosis.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Who else built a whole website just for the sake of being more hireable?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Miss me with all that. I am not doing 30 apps. I might push 3. But i scope the jobs out in person.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The other problem is, if you always go to all those 8am meetings and become a yes man with everything, next thing you know they’ll have you cleaning the office before you leave and staying an 1 hour after your shift has ended. Sad that some Gen Z think that Millennials are now the cooperate simps we all grew up bashing, wtf is happening here, the kids ain’t alright no more!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I applied to a lot of entry level jobs and I had some interviews, but still no job. Because I guess I don’t have enough experience. It’s an Entry Level Job!! So FREAKING ANNOYING!!

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I took college seriously (3.9/4 GPA) yet the job search was still insane. Thought science was a growing evolving necessary field
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jonathanf2392 did you reach out and use your colleges resources such as a career center? Have you tried talking to your professors about how to get into the field? Yeah the job search can be crazy, at the same time, there’s many different ways to leverage yourself into a position where you want to be, especially if you’re on a college campus. If you’re going for a corporate job, then sure, you most likely will not land that “dream job” you have to go outside of the corporate bubble.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i just want to move out, man. i’m 24 with a college degree
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sadly, I’ve only gotten jobs if I know someone already working there and they recommended me. I’m thankful about it but it shouldn’t be that way.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I aint tryna brag or anything but when I got out of trade-specific highschool (idk if its just a european thing), i applied to 10-15 companies and I got hired in like 3 months. Been working here for about 1.5 years..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The last rejection email I received, before thankfully landing a role, said verbatim: Dear {{RECIPIENT.FIRST.NAME}}  This was after 4 rounds of interviews.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People wouldn't be selling their bodies if jobs were better, it literally has always been the type of job desperate ppl unfortunately fell into to make a quick buck and survive, wither financial turmoils, mental instability or deñrug addictions. Normal healthy ppl did not go into SW for the shits and giggles, the reason there are so many ppl selling their bodies for money now is bc it pays you more than selling your soul and body on a fucking normal job. And people are not birthing bc we are literally animals, animals will not procreate in conditiona where they are constantly threatened and there will be no safety nor stability for their offspring
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like ive been pretty lucky from my job standpoint. Ive held this job for over three and a half years but now it’s becoming inconvenient to do the job because ive moved away kinda. Job isn’t worth driving an hour and a half and toll fees up to 15$ one way, so ive started too look for a new one and I’ve applied to a few and interviewed, nothing yet… day by day i feel worse about it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As someone has been climbing the insurance industry and is now an small market underwriter, yes soft skills are needed that lady is right. You’ll hear HR talk about it all the time. That’s what they are looking for. Just a heads up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Go the blue collar route!  I’m a 32 year old man. I started as an apprentice plumber at 18 yrs old. I now own my own business and a home.  The trades are where it’s at Gen Z!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im 23 and have worked multiple jobs since the year 2018 so i have no trouble at all, i just refuse the ones i dont want as I still get offers so i dont understand how gen z cant find a job.  Indeed has also helped me find many jobs so buddy it just you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And this is why I sold my soul to the government. It sucks sometimes, but at least I have money, a house and a job which I enjoy when I'm not working with idiots, and when I am working with idiots, I can progressively make their lives more difficult until they move me from that team. Because at this point they've invested too much money to get rid of me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: if you all can, you might want to try to get your CDL and be a truck driver -especially those of you who don't have any/much debt or bills. there are even 1 or more companies out there that will train you themselves  to get the CDL, and 1 or more pay you. But if you go that route be prepared to sign a contract to drive for that company for 6-24 months, and/or repay training fees bit by bit as you work and get paid by said company.  you could maybe get rid of that apartment. and the car if it isn't already paid off. live on the truck as much as you can. experiment and see how long at one time  you can withstand being on the truck. figure out where you can go shopping as a truck driver or base your hometime around how much food you can keep on the truck. use a rental car if you can get one on your time away from the truck.   you might want to stick with trucking (as shitty as it might be) for 2,3,5 or 10 years because the money may or may not be great as a rookie. assuming it gets better, that's all the more reason to stick with it for awhile. get your endorsements, get experience, and look for better paying trucking jobs as you progress.  but at least you can maybe drop the car and those rent payments. but be sure to be frugal financially on the road as well.save away your money.  keep the wheels turning, because when you're paid by the mile, it becomes "if the wheels ain't turning, you likely ain't earning" Keep your records clean, and follow the rules and laws. Protect that CDL - whether you're on the truck or the car.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Gen Xer, this was the case for all the jobs 20 years ago too.  But we didn’t have worry AI on top of everything.  Our biggest enemy back then was outsourcing, for the decent jobs.    If you’re young, I would advise trying fields that need people, nursing, law enforcement, teaching, military, electricians, plumbers, HVAC if you’re in the south, municipal government.  It took me 15 years to land my dream job so I pivoted to by me time took a bottom feeder job to buy me time.  In hindsight I should’ve joined the military during that gap.  I have a lot friends that did and they all moved up making Insane amounts of money now.  If it’s an option I highly suggest looking into it.  Corporations seem to think AI will solve everything. I have family members that were laid off in their late 60s and they aren’t even being hired even with 20 plus years of experience.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well I don't know. I am a Latino Millennial who worked since I was 21, at the age of 33 I moved to Germany where I worked for 4 and a half years +, Then I quit my job and then it was the End, I am looking for a Job since more than a Year, in my same Area Frontend Developer and they always says that I am not qualified for the Job, If I am lucky they actually respond to my application, so far I think my career ended, do not think after a Year someone is going to actually hire me. I have seen entry level Jobs, and they are asked to have at least 3 years experience and basically know what I know and more. I myself applied to those entry level Jobs very confident with the same response, I am not even getting an Interview.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: a huge reoson AI is so big right now is because of the mass use of social media and not just gen z, old people have tik tok now. If everyone wants to help this issue, one thing to do is DELETE INSTAGRAM, TIK TOK, X, ETC!!! continuing to use these dumb and generally useless platforms is making the problem worse. Not to mention, social media has overtaken some jobs making it impossible to be successful in one without promoting on an app. We are going down a very lose lose path.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Firefighters, police, EMS, military, plumbers, electricians, welders, linemen, mechanics, oilfield.  All hiring.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: But even having this job, day after day I feel like i cant afford anything and im treated like im the problem.  Respect goes both ways, if you respect me, i respect you. When im disrespected by whoever is above me and its not my fault? Is time wasted and not deserved.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Being disrespected by the very people I appoint to run my government? Then you don’t deserve my money or support. Being disrespected by my boss or my bosses boss, or my supervisor? Then you don’t deserve my time, even if the pay is good respect must go both ways.   But they leash you, they tell you “well if you don’t do what i tell you to then you can get your lazy ass out of here.” And knowing that it’s extremely difficult to get a job literally anywhere for no reason whatsoever keeps you down like a dog and its disgusting.   “You don’t pay the very people that you don’t support? Well we will lock you up and you cant do anything about it” (and yes i do pay my taxes) because im fucking leashed like a dog just like the rest of us and its awful.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You enjoy your singular generation audience.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Lol ur freakin funny (new subscriber ❤)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So glad I’m a union worker with minimum workday rates, overtime, missed meal penalties, short turnaround pay, night differential, and benefits instead of fighting for my life on job application portals to get paid 1/3 of what I do now lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Got pushed out of the labor market bc the only places hiring are jobs I physically can’t do 😭 sure that’s bc I’ve got a disability but it’s a pretty minor one tbh, it just makes it so I can’t do things humans weren’t meant to do anyway like stand at the register on concrete for 8 hours. Why the fuck is that my only option just because I haven’t finished my degree 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yall are insane lol. If you obtain a focus in a mediocre career than expect the issues and downsides that come with it. I saw an example in this video of a girl complaining she cant find a good job in marketing/business field ... are you serious? business and marketing has always been associated with an over abundance and lower career status. Experience in social media influence? Ive done that since I was 10 and had an ipod touch. I chose a focus in engineering and secured a career position aimed for growth before I even graduated college. The market is partially to blame, but I blame my own generation more for their lack of being able to adjust and navigate.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m from Russia, a medical student, and a lot of my peers are starting to look for jobs at this point. What everyone knows about this job finding app, that’s somewhat like a Russian Indeed,—a lot of jobs there are disguised web-cam studios and escort services. One of my friends applied to a literal hostess job at a karaoke, and after all the effort of chatting with a manager and coming for an interview it turned out the job included drinking and entertaining men who come to look(probably not only look) at pretty girls💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was applying for jobs for 4mths…  I managed to get 2 interviews in that time. how did I finally get one? A friend vouched for me🤦‍♀️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Pro tip: call a business you want to work with. Apliying online is like using tinder. The lazy option
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: IDK why, but all this situation reminds me of a Surgeon (i dont remember his name) that he quites his Job and went to live in nature (in i’m not wrong) because he hated the american way of helping people (which as european i think is just horrible)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i tried ever job nearby and I even tried join the military BUT have asthma and I need to study more. fuck my life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yup with the state of application process. employers will need to seek employees. its just not working the other way around anymore
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ve applied to atleast 50+ jobs in the past 3 months 10 in which I’ve probably heard back from
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like this has always been a thing since other generation, it's just that there is this thing called "social media" that allows people to post video on how they hate 9-5 jobs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the main problem is ghost listings wasting your bloody time. have fun applying online when you can't even trust the attempt will even achieve anything.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What is absolutely terrible in the gen z hate is that the older zoomers are nearing their 30's and the younger are years away from entering the work force yet they are already being lambasted for being the antichrist of the job market
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: -baum  -berg  -witz -stein Every single time
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a 29 year old with a salaried job, yes, they do own me. If I have a meeting and I have no emergencies or incredibly important prior commitments, then I am going to that meeting. It might not be enjoyable, but if I want to possibly move up in the company or stay long enough for it to be good on my resume then I'm going to need to do what's expected of me. I have employees under me, and if they aren't willing to fulfill some basic and reasonable requests like attend a meeting before work then it's a sign of their work ethic being poor.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i’m confused how there’s a crisis when we could all just start a revolution. like, seems like no one will be back on their feet in the next few years anyways. i’m struggling to understand how intense boycotts, rent and debt strikes, and refusal to apply to companies so we can eventually have more autonomy is worse than applying to thousands of jobs and starving for years with no intention of changing the system 🤷
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wonder how many are looking for skilled trade work. The job market desperate for more workers is the one no one applies for
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Job market so bad bros following his dreams 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a gen z, All im hearing is huge skill issue. Secured my career in engineering before I even graduated college. Yalls problem is that you pick mediocre fields like business and expect greater than mediocre results...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey can I use this as a source on my HPQ?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, dropped from a $60k full time job to one $16.60 (minimum) and one $18 part time jobs after searching for 11 months and getting low on my saving. I make enough that I don’t have to dip into my saving more, but I’m only making just enough for my expenses and my expenses of ~$1500/month is low for my area
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Is the world just like this? Im a recent grad in SK and the exact same thing is happening here too these companies want a 25 year old grad with 30 years experience lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Literally literally literally. Like, literally?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I learned that the main place I work at is being shut down on the 30th. They told us a week ago. And now I'm over here filling out a million applications of shit I don't want to do and.. it's not going so good :) I'm 25 & queer
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ve had companies ask me the most hilarious questions in interviews like so overcomplicated I just laugh in their face and hang up. Take the $20 an hour and shove it buddy!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The fact I have to recommend this because it’s what I did is sad but… enlistment?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's not that nobody wants to work, nobody wants to pay for the work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: applied for 10 jobs. heard back from 2. said this isnt going to work. changed my approach, was highered by the end of the week. how do you apply to 600 jobs and not realize what youre doing isnt working
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: At 14:00 really turned my gears (fist raised like a boomer) I’ve been applying and they always ask me questions that relate to this. I’m a band kid (oh no he’s a weirdo) but that means that I can easily answer their questions. Can I say calm in a high intense performance? YES! As a percussionist i literally have to stay calm while there are hundreds of eyes and cameras watching me or else my hands are gonna jitter and that’s gonna mess up my playing. Have I ever had a leadership role? Yes I was pit captain for 2 years. What’s your availability? I’m completely free now that I’m out of school. Are you willing to work long hours? I am at school at 7:30am (was 6:30am for jazz band but my siblings didn’t wanna wake up that early)…and I leave at 9:30pm every Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday because of practice (I don’t go home for the 2 hour gap between school and rehearsal so I can save gas and practice on my own music for solo and ensemble or school work). There’s sectionals on Tuesday until 5:30, football games on Friday, and then parade and field show competitions on Saturday where I have to be up at 4am because call time is 5:30am and I live 20 minutes away. I then have to load up the trailer because I’m a percussionist, get to the place that’s an hour away, unload the trailer, get dressed in uniform, and proceed to march and stop and march and stop for 2-3 hours in lovely 105F Southern California autumn for 1-3 miles depending on the location (while carrying a drum and playing cadences) just to do a parade at the end and get literally judged because we’re competitive. Then (after sitting on sunburnt bleachers or just dirt for an hour because of awards) we have to get back to the busses and trailer and either unload all of pit or load up drumline because the field show may or may not be at a different location. Then I have to push everything to a rehearsal spot (GOSH I REALLY HATE THE MIXER WHY IS IT SO HEAVY WITH BROKEN WHEELS). After rehearsing we have to push everything to the school’s football field and we get like 10 minutes to wait and enjoy the band before us. Then we have to rush everything onto the field and set up, making sure all of the mics and speakers work properly for the pit and soloist, along with the synth and samples, all with a 3 minute timer otherwise we get points deducted. Then we perform our field show infront of thousands of eyes and cameras, some family members, schools that already performed, random people, and judges with cameras. After the performance we have to push everything back to the busses and load up the trailer where we can finally dress out of uniform and watch the last 2-3 bands perform before awards (at 10pm) finally we back on the busses proud of our work and ready to be back at school by 12am…where I then have to unload the trailer and organize all of the percussion stuff neatly in the drum room because I’m pit captain and have to set an example. Now finally at 1 am I sit in the parking lot and wait another hour all alone to be picked up because my family doesn’t care despite being night owls. So yes. I can indeed work long ours thank you very much. Oh and during concert season football changes to basketball and instead of driving to the event we host it so I have to help out all of the other schools and be part of stage crew where it’s setting up stands and chairs for at least 15 schools, most have at least 2 groups or more, and if it’s chino I have tear down the entire stage so that I can fit all of their own equipment on stage because they wanna use their own timpani, marimba, bass drum, snare, chimes, gong, glock, and literally every other percussion instrument ever because they’re that big. I also have to keep track of any mallets, cymbals, and toys (stuff like tambourine, woodblock, vibraslap) that other schools might need to borrow. Yes I have to take off any of the big instruments a school won’t be using like a marimba so that there’s space for chairs and so it’s not something just sitting there awkwardly. I also have to tune every note on the timpani by ear several times because some kids will tune it before performing using a tuner which sucks on timps because of overtones and other shizz. And yes, at the end of that day, I have to perform for both the concert band, the wind ensemble, and percussion ensemble, (and any solo songs if I had one prepared at the time). But yes as host we are the last to perform and then we get a little lesson with the judges and then they give our director the ability to pick a random piece from a selection that the judge has and we are given 4 minutes to only look at the piece. No playing or singing. Just look and study. Then we perform and get judged.  Mmm…nah. You don’t have enough work experience to understand this entry level job. You don’t have enough leaderships. You don’t have enough loyalty. And I know this is gonna upset you…you’ll have to work on Saturdays! 😱😱😱. And we already know that your gen z brain can’t handle this 9-5 grind as a cashier/retailer/sales/barista. So we’re just gonna hire this guy who mopped floors at Del taco for a year while vaping every break he has (including 30 minute bathroom breaks) because it’s actual work.  (Yes as pit captain do I have to clean and dust all of the percussion instruments with my crew periodically and I live with a family of 7 so that’s a lot of crumbs and spills that kids make)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If we don't wanna work. Let's Figure It Out So We Don't Have Too.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don’t know what to say anymore  But like the upper half will see when no one works
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 30 with 5+ years of professional experience. I have been looking for a job in a change of industry for 9 months and am currently working a job that does not remotely require my college degree. It’s not just Gen Z.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I applied to over 150 jobs before finally getting hired at a White Castle of all places. It’s not much but it’s a job.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well i personally worked the first job i ever applied for and stayed for almost 10 years but a new manager came in and had a grudge against my family and later fired me for showing up 9 mins late, to work a gas station job 😂😂 jokes on her i hated working there.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am gen z, and also own a business, and the fact that gen z doesnt want to work and put in the effort is true, i ve been on the opposite side of the hiring table. Everybody expects big salary, with no credentials to prove. When i started out I always bet on my skill and ability to figure it out on the spot. People dont realise that for you to get x  on paycheck, you need to make the company at least 4x that amount.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “Spending more money on the wrong things is far worse than spending less money on the right things,” he  said to a group of NAS staffers, university lobbyists, and a handful of senior administrators from the  National Science Foundation. Do you think Michael Kratsios, NAS staffers, university lobbyists and some senior NSF administrators will be able to answer this question verbally, completely and on the spot under 10 seconds? "From where does the industry🏭 comes from?" Try answering it completely and verbally and on the spot under 10 seconds⏳.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It`s tough for all generations. I am a millenial, thankfully with a good and secure job, but some of my top qualified friends in their mid 40s, who worked in the field for 20 years, have been unemployed for at least a year despite sending 100 applications for any job they that is somehwat in their field of expertise. This is central Europe but it seems to be the same pretty much anywhere.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this might be a worldwide problem, cuz here in brazil is the same
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I did have a interview lined up but they canceled it with no nothing hours before.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gosh that’s a tangent. I’ll go through it later and edit any mistakes
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well this doesn't make me even more suxidal at all
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im so glad i chose trade school. im 23 and i make $100k salary
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Last month I applied to 200 jobs. 70 interviews and 0 call backs. YET all those jobs ARE HIRING
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: everything is so horrible these days. the job listings for entry-level positions in my field basically all require you to do 3 people's jobs at once, while being paid minimum wage. I have legal requirements for staying in my country so i cannot legally accept wage below a certain number, but i haven't found a single job offer that doesn't ask for 2 years of work experience minimum. what's the point of studying for five years, spending tens of thousands of dollars in the process, just to not even be able to get your foot in the door?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It sucks even more when your dream job gets federally defunded
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As someone who works in HR and hiring, AI having such a big place in Talent Acquisition is awful and drives me up a wall. It takes away the human element in HUMAN Resources. I personally read every resume that comes into our system, there are many distinctions that AI might not make. For example, AI might count someone out for a gap in work history, but a human could reason “well, maybe they were ill or taking care of a sick family member or they were a SAH parent or just needed a damn break. They have the qualifications, let’s chat”.  I feel for young people looking for a job.  Rejections can take a toll on self esteem and feel like a condemnation of you as a person. Please remember you are doing your best, I myself applied to countless jobs before getting the one I currently have.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same shit in Europe, different flavor. Trust me the minimum wage won't fix this. Iam being extorted by state for roughly 65% of all of my income and becoming anything else but a fucking toilet cleaner without credentials is impossible. They don't even care about experience.  Whenever the minimum wage rises, prices rise and nobody is willing to pay more than minimum wage. The real problem are governments that take your money and throw it at other countries that do nothing but buy cars and cocaine with it. Afterwards they realize they're out of money and raise the taxes/ print more money. The governments are out of control.  They make your money worthless and expect you to take the blow.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The reason they use ai is because the person that’s supposed to be doing applications and interviews isn’t doing their job and outsourced it to a chat bot
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why would you work if nothing comes of it? They can’t afford a car, buying a home or building a family because those same corporations don’t want to pay and the economy is trash. Why would they want to work for nothing ? This generation is disenchanted.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We have a saying in my country "the prize for working hard is more work" no wonder people stopped giving a shit
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Corpos: "Millenials are lazy!" Millenials: "You won't promote us." Corpos: "GenZ is lazy!" GenZ: "You don't pay us."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There was a point in life i used to bust my ass, doing double my work quotas. Know what i got on all my reviews? “Meets expectations”  It really fucks with your ability to keep giving a shit.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Me and my friends: "I've applied to 50 jobs this month and have heard nothing. I'm so stressed that I'm barely holding myself together and I've cried myself to sleep every night."  Older People: "Stop being lazy!"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: A teacher of mine once said in class “ the old ways will die when the old people die “
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Older generations talk as though Gen Zers are rejecting a perfectly good system that serves their interests. In truth, they're seeing a system designed such that work makes you broke instead of giving you a better life and seeing there's nothing to be gained from participating in it and making the first steps to answering "If not that, then what?"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly this just boils down to the economy situation. I'm willing to believe that if working a standard 9-5 could support someone getting a house and family, there would be significantly less complaining.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wait a minute.. why doesn't Gen Z want to work in a terrible office like their parents? Don't they realize that watching their parents be miserable everyday and come home exhausted is a privilege? LOL
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In China there is a movement called “let it rot” where young people also don’t see any point in working hard, it will never be enough and there is no reward other than more work
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a gen z, I don't WANT to work.   I WILL work. I'll come in on time, I'll do my tasks, I'll be friendly to annoying customers and coworkers, I might even go above and beyond sometimes. I'm just tired of pretending I like it. I don't need to be passionate about my job and the company to do a good job. I can just do the work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My job is purely transactional. I clock in, they tell me what they want me to do, I do the task, and then they cut a check for my labor. I’m not striving to go above and beyond.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The fact my parents said I could go to a large university when I had no idea what I wanted to do, expecting me to figure it out, and now working a job I could have gotten with a community college degree, and now 100k in debt, is wild.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm gen X,1979. My kids are gen Z. Our kids aren't the problem. Genz know it's all BS at 18. I didn't understand until I was 40 with 4 kids.  My kids don't even want kids because they see me work all the time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Being told unironically that desiring the lifestyle my parents had when they were raising baby me is an unrealistic expectation by that same generation is absolutely wild to me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i'm gen z, i graduated with a bachelor's degree 2 years ago and i can't even get a job at a grocery store
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Currently learning the fine art of not picking up my coworkers slack and not feeling bad when shit gets bad
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Time is something you can never get back, but companies think you owe them 40-60 hours a week to never see your loved ones and to still not be able to afford a house to live in.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1998 here! I gave my company my all when I went through training. I worked as hard as I could. I volunteered to help, was excited to learn new things, and I was as engaged as possible. I was SO excited.  5 years later and now I do bare minimum. All of my hard work came with pats on the back but no pay increase, it’s SO HARD to get a promotion, and when you bring up issues it’s swept under the rug. Corporate America is a joke and it treats me and my work like I’m a joke. So I’m just returning the energy!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm Gen Z, 24 years old and I still live with my parents. I've told them I want to save up enough money to buy my house because I don't want to rent a place only to move out 5 years later. They told me they had no issue with that, but I can't imagine the ammount of people my age who can't have that reassurance and support. Companies should really look out for their workers way more than they do.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THIS. We teach them about sharing, justice and fairness and the American dream then pull the rug out as soon as they become adults and say every man for himself. HUH?! I don't blame them for feeling the whole thing is BS.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @AmandaHayes The American dream is just that now, a dream😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @AmandaHayes i’ve never even thought about it like this but you’re absolutely correct and now i feel even more jaded lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @AmandaHayes it was the same for Gen X — and even Millennials — as well.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Kiuraish What are you going on about? This video isn't about people like you with their already-established careers and homes that they were able to buy when the economy was still decent. It's about a young generation who has no hope for any of that, EVEN IF they "work hard and persevere". Plenty of them are in fact doing that and will never see the same fruits of their labor that you've been PRIVILEGED enough to enjoy. You're not any better than anyone else. You just had an opportunity to go to law school and buy a house at the right time. Gen Z is disenfranchised and disillusioned, and for very good reason. Clearly the point of this entire video went way over your head. Very disappointing to see a fellow millennial out here sounding like a boomer.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @triciatyner2555 LMAO me thinking it was a boomer that wrote the comment  😂😂😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @triciatyner2555 we bought our house last year. Wouldn't say that was when the economy was decent. Sorry I don't have time rn to address all the other assumptions. But please don't let videos like these make you disillusioned about the world. They're just YouTube videos. That's all.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Kiuraish  What would your parents think about this ? How about your wife ? Would you accept that your future children does the same ?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Reddfrogg  what's the alternative? Go to college and pay off that debt for your remaining days?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you! It’s very confusing because the America I was taught about is not the America that exists right now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Kiuraish  I meant husband, my apologies, English is not my first language. I guess you are better than me on that front too. That and everything else ;).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: when what i earn after hours of work dont cover my rent, i rather not work and be homeless lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @yygg9786 ever been homeless? Better think twice
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We ought to start a movement that’ll get the CIAs attention
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I' not a Gen Z (on the very limit inbetween Millenial and Gen Z) but I've only managed to buy a car because I'm still living with my parents. As for buying my own house, that will never happen because prices are ridiculous. Even  our own people are starting to live in the neighbour countries because they cannot afford to live here!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Forget having a house, we wont have a planet by the time were in our mid thirties, the fck are we supposed to work toward?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Because food...shelter...water... electric
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: By the time we can afford a home the only thing left will be new construction so shoddy we have to pay for it twice to get one functioning home
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I wanted to be a teacher, but didn’t have the gpa, the money, and I’m afraid of debt, I want to be an author but I spend so much of my energy working, and doing daily things (I’m autistic and adhd btw) that by the time the weekend comes it’s all I can do to take care of myself and my cats. I wanted desperately to be independent because I got tired of getting told I was lazy, and just ‘didn’t want to work’ when people talk about folks on disability who can’t afford to live without it but aren’t allowed to save money, invest in anything and I’m not even allowed to move in with my partner without losing my disability and potentially putting him in a situation where he would have to support me. There’s no winning. You go to work, you smile and do all of the things people tell you to do and then you’re miserable because you have no time for your aspirations.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Symbolic-Sky sorry to say this but I think. Someone overdiagnosed you as autistic, ADHD I can somehow accept but dont use diagnosis of autism Just so lightly. If you are able to write so well you are not autistic to the degree which affects daily life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have been working for almost 20 years. Inflation makes it all seem like a waste. I really don't care anymore.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Gen X’er, I sympathise. Truthfully, though, I should empathise. As a member of the directionless, anti-authoritarian, mess of a group of unorthodox entrepreneurs, I can say we also were disenchanted — broke and feeling deliberately deceived, with no map or plan for a future. Stability? Oh, forget about it. We were raging against the machine that Gen Z is now simply ignoring into obsolescence. Rather than be indifferent to one another, we need to join forces and find the best path forward. And, to be clear, I do NOT know what that is. But we could hopefully find it together.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Kiuraish  Yet again, what are you trying to achieve with that behavior ? Feel better about yourself ? Feeling superior ? Having a sense of accomplishment ? What is the purpose of all this flexing theatre ? What do you think will be the consequences of that display of success, to yourself, to others ? How a smart and elite class lawyer finds value in belittlement ? What does it say about its ability to have genuine empathy towards a client ?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: in this system, they dont let u get rich
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Adults said the same things about GenX. We were "slackers".
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I agree and on top of that many of the requirements and experience are much higher than what our parents experienced making it harder to achieve the same life they had. This is not only because businesses and schools now have a global amount of candidates to choose from but also because requirements are moving ahead which on one hand is good but on the other hand is bad especially for those who in practice would be amazing given the chance but may be bad test takers. For example most Physical therapists in my area who practice are great however only have a masters in physical therapy however now a days to practice you must have a doctorate and the acceptance rate to PT school is even lower than law school or med school the only one lower is dental school… so not very fair to people hoping to get into that kind of work in this age. Also this applies even to just general college admissions.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a Gen Z Farm boy (now a man) And thank goodness my family made good investments in the 1930s to have a farm I will soon be the owner  I’m currently age 20  The farm doesn’t make a lot of money  And so do I, but still half of what I make goes to the farm . The farm Animals get fed before I eat And I plan to build my dream for home Though currently right now, I have no woman in my life. I still want to  Wait for the right woman who’s gonna die with me And hope that when I raise my kids I’m gonna keep them far away from technology  Because I lives most of my life with a screen stuck in my face… It’s a good thing that my dad  had brought me back to reality several times that life is tough and it’s not forever
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly, and notably; many products considered luxurious in the 2000s have totally become more affordable, while our needs have become prohibitively expensive.   The world we're in is primed for depressive conditions of not realistically owning our needs like a home and reliable car, and mood boosting hobbies and sources of enjoyment needed to continue holding back tears at work being dangled in front of us.   And I can confirm; being frugal and refusing to have hobbies...doesn't free up enough income to afford a down payment on a house at all if your body happens to give out from working by 23...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I really like gen Z, they are rebellious and smart. I am sure they will find a way to survive and flourish.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The economy is actually ridiculously good. Not for a regular citizen though :))
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It can literally cost you to work with how low these wages are given gas to get there, food, clothing, and everything else. I'm just not doing that shit and I'm lucky that I'm in a good enough spot to not work at all until the wages raise a bit.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @rpblackout743  If you are in a lower wage then your life will  be subsized by the higher earners. Your higher earners are leaving the  UK in increasing numbers to find lower taxes and safety, (specially if a person is Jewish and has a family). The  UK faces higher taxesm with less money to pay them.  I would think  that those who own property are greedy, and you have open borders, offering a free live to anyone who can get to the UK. Your crime bill is 10% GDP  and growing, and so bigger prisons needed as you try to catch up with Sweden. Once corruption takes hold, the even the USA starts to see you as a threat/liabilty. Its a shame that working can make a person poorer, which needs fixing, but in the UK at the moment, all a person needs for themselves and family is free at the moment.  UK in general has a poor work ethic, and tis gets worse over time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hit the nail on the head. I'm older gen Z and I've been in the working world for almost a decade now but like. One thing happens to my car and I have to pay, I cannot financially recover it from it. I ask for a raise after working my ass off and I'm hit with: "sorry but according to company policy.." Or "sure! We'll give you a 2 percent raise. At your NEXT performance review. :)"   Why would I even want to give 100 to a company I'm working for if my employer won't even meet me half way?

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This. Thank God I was blessed with strict parents who didn't play around with credit or debt. Which stayed with me later in life but the way schools and society "sets" us younger generations for the real world is a waste of our taxes 😮‍💨
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: To top it off most of us will probably work a shitty job that's impossible to enjoy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SyzyfusOryginal  In other words, you have grown up with a distorted veiw of reality, perpetuated by social media no doubt.  Its very possible a war is coming your way which means survival is the new priority.

One who's a first generation college student who's worked 50+ hours a week since he graduated high school to get to where he is. You would be hard pressed to find anyone smarter and harder working than me.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yet the 16- to 17-year-old set that have been hired in my area locally in the last two or three years, and are making some sacrifices to get ahead while they are still living at home, are doing well partly because their efforts are noticed and rewarded with opportunities, grants, and other help that employers have been very reluctant to give their older peers who couldn't care less. Maybe that's just local, but that is how things have been going recently. We have also had some more traditional Mennonite / Amish type youth in the area who have an incredible work ethic along with experience that makes them worth even more.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Meanwhile the Millionaires have become Gazillionaires and its being applauded.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Because you have no other choice. Zoom out of elite hoods of elite cities in the us, and you'll see that's how most of the world lived for the entire history. At least half the population of top 5 countries in Europe could never afford a new car, always 5-8 years old, but somehow NOW that's a huge issue.  With the generation that loves the environment so much I don't get why they even want cars, they should have bicycles. Real ones, not the polluting kind.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: But not working isnt going to do anything either. They will just hire people from other countries that want to work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was scared of moving back in with my parents so I went to work as a teacher. I'd rather be homeless than have to live with them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey man, those CEO's need their 40 million dollar bonus'.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just did the math. 1 person working at Starbucks as a barista has enough to dedicate between 25-30% of their income to rent in Texas (not the prettiest options but for sure livable).  Avoid debt, get married to a working spouse, live frugally and you can start building a future. Especially if you take advantage of the many retirment investment vehicles available to them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: because some money is better than no money
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes or you get promoted and you get a pay increase only to find out that you are keeping up with inflation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is how millennials feel as well. The boomers were able to work hard for and get the things they want. We can’t.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im a member of the previous generation and I work 70 hours a week, I get it. I'm not sure if it will ever improve.  I'm in the United States, trump beats the democrats but life still sucks

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Because my mom kicked me out and food.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 🚩🚩Because that is what Humankind has been doing for Centuries, and we seem to be the only Generations ( Z and Millenials ), that won't work unless we became Rich. ✨️✨️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Do you like not being homeless?  (Im talking just general shelter)  thats what's the point.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Gen Xer, I agree with the futility of trying to work for absolutely nothing in return. Where you own a house in the future question maybe… Maybe not. Will your country look after you so as to properly manage immigration so you will be able to work? Maybe… Maybe not. On and on it goes. Corporation and politicians have made it so difficult to work at empty level today.; Then you add the DEI mess.  The babyboomer called us (the Gen X er) what they call the Gen Z today.  Forget it!  Focus on faith family and freedom.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Man, would ya look at the ego in this one. That’s where all of that is coming from. “Me, me, me, what do I get?” This mindset is the issue. As if the only reason to pursue life is if you can buy the things you want. Think about that for a second. Really think. See anything backwards?   If not, I don’t have anything else to offer you. Just don’t be surprised as people continue to not share your empathy. Get out of your own way and see a world more than money. If you are going to smash the system, you’ve gotta be prepared to replace it. What you’re complaining about is that somebody isn’t letting you in the system that you think is broken. Create something new or get left behind.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They need to observe how immigrants who came to the west with nothing make ends meet and still end up getting a home, a car and a career. THEY WORK LIKE HELL AND SPEND LITTLE.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Precisely. Shit is like asking why slaves have less work ethic than business owners. Like what are we saying lmao. And sure we aren't slaves (yet) but we're a hell of a lot closer to it than boomers were who had financial security and freedom as a result of their work. We have nothing as a result of our work
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We don't try because there's nothing to gain from trying.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a 26 year under paid Local 669 Fire Sprinkler Fitter and can not agree more. I don’t know why anyone. Especially a young person. Would sign up for a life of never affording a house or family. The wages are horrible. Although we do make enough to buy a used car.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Buying a home and building a Family are too expensive anyways
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Disillusioned is another good word for it. They were sold this idea of the future, but with how the world is today they just can’t believe in it anymore.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is exactly what I feel. It is not that I don't want to work, but I don't want to waste most hours of my week doing a job that exploits me with a terrible salary and doesn't even allow me to enjoy life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@barelyreal1what is the other alternative?? Do you have an alternative ideas for these Losers.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@Kiuraish  I think they mean lawers aren't a necessity for human survival. Which I agree with, I teach specialised learning, so apocalypse wise we'd both be pretty usless.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @emmyl1624 that's very true. I get it in that sense too. But of course humans not only need to survive but to thrive. Some jobs are for surviving, some for thriving, both are needed. As a teacher your work is invaluable and very respectable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @emmyl1624  YouTube as a company wouldnt even be around to host videos for people to comment on without lawyers and people wouldn't even know how to write to comment without teachers. So I don't mind these attacks haha!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: lawyers are truly the weakest link
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Some of us don't have the option to just not work 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They will have more than nothing if they work, just like everyone else.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Agree, but many are lazy. I've seen over 50 myself in a factory environment. About 1/3 couldn't even finish the very first day, seriously! The rest leave within the 1st month. One guy made it past 1 month. He had a wife an
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you only aspire to work at McDonald's, sure you won't make something of yourself, but even if aspire to be a manager or nurse, teacher, etc you can still succeed.  It won't happen exactly the same way, but Good decisions will be rewarded.  Why make life harder for yourself and give up? You're not in a prison, there is room for creative solutions
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: but what are they going to DO about it?  I think they are in a state of video-game inertia.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Because you start somewhere and work your way up. The sooner you accept that reality, the better off you’ll be.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hear this point, I do. But I happen to work with a subset of gen z who happen to be pretty well off, and the well off ones whose parents are footing the bill for their college, cars, etc don't have any work ethic either.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: you only invest a year of work and want a car and a house... please... it takes years...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i bought a nice silverado and have an high paying blue collar job and can afford trade school so i dont understand it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Mihka98  That's cause blue collar jobs are more in demand than white collar jobs nowadays. The market for white collar jobs is too over saturated after everyone went to college.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why? Homeless and hunger might be a good reason.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We all are.   Enjoy living in the street I guess?  Yall are coddled
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Money doesn't grow on trees, neither does experience. Everyone has to start somewhere, but they won't get anywhere if they're crying at just the beginning
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And they also spend money on unnecessary things.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We all felt that way when we were young. I never thought I’d own a home and didn’t until my 30s. Still working out retirement and debt. People act like every generation hasn’t been through it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm born in 1996. This year I suppose is borderline melinnial/gen z. I feel I don't fit in either.😅

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @michealstotten3741  Burned out? Imagine also having 4 children as was common not so long ago.  Their problem in  4, 5 hours a day glued to social media.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And this isn’t true for millennials as well? The truth is that most of them just don’t want to work. That sounds rude, but the only thing most of them care about is being on their phones instead of working. Go to work. Do the work. Go home. Do a good job, and maybe you’ll move up. What else are we supposed to do? We have to make money to live.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @parvanirose  do you see these people who don't work not having money? It's usually those who don't work that make more money than those who do. That's the capitalist system we live in. Parasyte "jobs" pay better, so you'll sooner see someone try to hit the jackpot in some way through ways in which large companies and rich people exploit people's indifference with money than see someone agree to do a hard job for a mediocre pay. It's the fact that the option to get paid for doing nothing already exists. If it didn't exist, then these people would have nowhere to go and come back working. That's the free market for you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nah u just can't budget and save money😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You just proved how entitled you are
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: then stay broke and homeless I guess? those are your options, deal with it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @johnfisher8401  There's one more option
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m gen z and I just bought a house. Most people can’t balance a budget.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How would they know that’s even true without trying? Getting ahead in the USA is easier than anywhere else
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So just don't work is your answer? What corner do you live on?

I have an accent and English is not my first language. I took crap from gen z and moved up the ladder.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So how are you going to eat?! Foodstamp’s?! Just cuz you won’t own anything now doesn’t mean you shouldn’t work cuz literally…. How will you eat?! How will you buy clothes or things you need without any income?? That’s my question 🙋‍♀️ is y’all’s parents financing your lifestyle you think you don’t need to work 😂 I’ve been out in the world working so I never have to go back to my parents!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Standard work week in China is 72 hours (6-12's), and we have ppl here complaining about putting in 40 smh.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ a race to the bottom? That’s their own problem. Being oppressed isn’t a thing to have dignity about.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Problem with this is companies will just hire migrants, outsource or use AI to replace gen z. Gen z is not rebelling. They're just making the dystopia worse. At the very least, work to learn work skills. Then use learned skills to do own hustle. Maybe learn trade work. Maybe teach english in non english speaking countries or something. Preferably in countries with lower costs of living. But if gen z keep saying their dream job is to not have a job, the world is gonna leave them behind.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ixiahj  if companies could pay gen z what they pay immigrants, they would. It doesn’t matter who gets hired, as long as companies are allowed to get away with literal crimes to raise their profits, nothing is gonna change
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ixiahj I disagree, hybrid and home working has now become a thing with the rise of Gen Z wanting a Work life balance. We all don’t want to work but it’s not going to happen. hybrid and flexible working is the future.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @ixiahj Honestly, kinda yeah. Work to learn trade skills, to take care of things yourself
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Because if they don’t work what will they do? We all need money
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah except that’s not true. Like it is a little bit…. But not really. Inflation is real but you don’t have to buy a home at 22. And you don’t have to buy a new car. You can buy a used car until you get a real career. There’s mixed issues
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @  even used car are more expensive now, though. and it’s a coin toss if a cheaper one doesn’t need work done.   also, why continue paying over 1k to rent a small space when a mortgage is almost the same? yeah you’re more responsible for the property & have taxes, but at least you own it, have more space, more privacy & typically your own parking space.   and rent also just keeps going up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So many excuses. The entitlement is strong in your generation bud. Y’all have a lot to learn
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have yet to see a Gen Z complaining about exactly what you are complaining about cut expensive like I had, to have a home. We never ate out we had clothing for our kids that was passed down a few times already before they got to them. I had a flip phone forever. People today do not live without things because they feel they should have all these things brand new and the latest and are signed up to everything monthly and eating out daily and do not realize how much all this adds up to yearly and that most people had to wait to live like that and have the home etc.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Everyone has to work. If people can still afford luxuries then they have too much of a safety net. In most of the world, if you choose not to work you don't eat
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They get what they voted for...I have no sympathy for gen z
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The only thing you get from work isn't money. Especially down the line. I think we need to make the fed min closer to 30, because the sheer lack of money is bad, but like this mentality of the fact that people think the only thing you gain from work is money just makes the world shittier.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Bob-fj7lr Do you not realize if the Federal minimum wage is increased to $30 that everything you use or buy will increase radically? Flip this around. If you owned a business would you pay unskilled labor $30/hr. The answer is no.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Unless they're literally not getting paid, they are not working for nothing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Absolute fallacy. I am gen Z, bought a house almost 2 years ago at 22 and a car shortly after.  Work ethic IS the problem, not the economy. I will admit it isn’t as easy as it maybe has been 5-10 years ago, but every generation has had economic struggles, that’s how the economy works.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠​⁠​⁠ @caitothepotato.    what’s your profession that allowed you to purchase a home at 22?  when & how’d you get started?  what state do you live in?   how much did you put down for a house and/or how did you get approved for the loan?   what’s the conditions of said home?   and how much is your mortgage?   cars are simpler to obtain, so i won’t ask. i saved 5k to buy my first one & got a 10k loan for the second after someone hit & totaled the first one...   but i’ve been renting since 21, 24 now & plan on owning before 27.  most of my friends who live in homes were helped by their families, though. so i’m just curious as to how you’ve done it alone without a career in media/sports or anything.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @caitothepotato.  Discarding a systemic point by a personal anecdote in also fallacious.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Since the first time I heard that, I told my boss "fuck that" and laughed
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My mom (Gen X) says that a lot, almost always to caution me against going above and beyond at work without additional compensation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think the idea with that (because I have been told the same thing) is that back a million years ago, more work would also mean more responsibility because you had proven yourself to be trustworthy.  Consequently, you were given more authority and/or a raise and/or a promotion. Remember also that most people would work in the same company for 20 years. Trust and experience were key to being successful. So more work was better. I still think there's some of that idea around today, but it's not even close to the same degree.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this is really universal, this is also a saying in mexico!

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: and that hard work gets stolen by your boss/coworker/classmate so you never get the “reward” for your hard work except just knowing you did it

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @willmakk  I've heard many stories about Boomers who say they aren't going to retire bc they have an easy job and get paid alot.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @willmakk  Elon Musk is Gen X and he's the scummiest union buster out there.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​@willmakk "yes, and..." applies, since many corpos are also boomers. Edit: grammar/punctuation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: To this day they still won't promote us, either. Just as a heads up to you Gen Z folks out there, if there's a thing you're noticing now, it will probably still be a thing when you're old and have kids. Millenials have to job hop for promotions... I've been at companies for 2, 5, 6 years with no promotion, including one job where the offer they sent me was for a higher position than they actually hired me into. Someone with the same first name got the position I was hired into and I got their offered job. Oops. Then they created the position for me in the role they offered me and put someone else in that new position they had made for me. Oh, well.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No matter how hard work genz will do it will take atleast 6 years-14years 100% of their salary to afford a house in america. That means live homeless and beg on the street if u dont wanna double the years!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @vuvu5152  you gotta take into account the rising house prices. Gen Z will never have a house. Not unless all their family members pitch in.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z are "hard to work with" just like millennials cause both generations  don't want to be treated like trash. They said the same thing about my generation (millennial)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Damn that cyberpunk slang really is doing work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Literally i was getting paid bellow minimum wage and my mom isnt even paid enough to get us into a house other then about the cheapest place you can get (literally meant for people who cant work full time yet we cant afford anything else when my mom doesnt even have a day off unlike everyone she works with)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennials have never been paid either. We were just promised we would be. At least with Gen Z they just gave you the 🖕right off the bat…in the end, we both got ****ed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Happen to millennial but gen z is more vocal about it so they get the burn
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The point she is missing is that she seems to relate this to work at corporations and the private sector. Im a mellenial and a teacher, i love my job, it´s meaningful and i have an ok salary, the most important thing is that i contribute to society. Working in public education I also have some democratic influence over my work. I could work as a janitor, in the shool kitchen for a modest salary but i would never become a corp drone without any other meaning than earning money for rich guys.   Work with something real that help people and society directly, rather than doing something abstract just for the benefit of the 1%
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: and then... Corpos: "It's all about your mindset! YOUR FRICKING MINDSET!"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: then gen alpha might be "you don't hire us"

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it's literally getting to that cyberpunk dystopian level. shit sucks.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: At this point millennials have just been telling gen z “Welcome to the party. Now setup a chair for gen alpha and gen beta. The world is celebration begins.”. It’s nice having another generation here dealing with the same bullshit to show that it wasn’t the lie of millennials being lazy, but I honestly would rather it have been that so gen z wouldn’t have to suffer this nonsense. Since things aren’t looking any better on the horizon and actually worse, I’m bracing for gen alpha and gen beta.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: These trends come back for every new generation, the old heads need to stop living in the past and leave existence already. It'll be better for the world
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Go back and they were calling f GenX ‘slackers’ that meant the same thing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "I'm not earning enough" "this is not my job" said the 16 year old kid.  "when I was 16"... scratch that, when I was 9 years older then I am now, I was making the same shit money I wasn't bitching about the pay. I was interested in my work, it took me 8 years to rise up the 6th ranks to make 150% more money then a 16 year old kid working full time, to running the store making more then 150%. for two years I would see kids age 16-18 make per hour what I would earn per day working night shift...  there's no "back in my days" $20 per hour as a 16 year old kid you should be very great full. it took me almost a decade to get to that point where I don't have to think about "next month pay".
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @svampebob007  so that $20 right is far above what the average person makes, the federal minimum wage is 7.25 an hour, if you account for inflation the federal minimum wage today from the minimum wage in 1970 would be about ~$11 so not only are we getting paid 75% of what people used to, the average median rent of a house in the 1970s was ~100 now a days it’s $1000+ so not only are we making 25% less, the median rent has gone up 10x
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This this this!! I know that there are boomers that are the exception And millennials also have some fault to blame and that we weren’t more active, but Jen saw the millennials play by the rules and get nowhere and y’all really are out there trying to pretend like they didn’t see all that and aren’t acting accordingly
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Maybe it's not the workers at all, regardless of age. The system is set up to exploit workers without rewarding them with a decent life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh, we Millennials are also entitled, whiny, and eating too much avocado toast, and buying too many lattes. Because buying small things that help us get through an unbearable existence is why the economy is failing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ohkaygoplay  I assure you that has nothing to do with it, accounting for inflation did you know that the federal minimum wage is 25% less than what it was in the 1970s, and on top of that did you know that the median rent has gone up 10x from what it was in the 1970s
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennials never seem to get credit for how hard they actually work, not to mention we were peak unpaid internship generation. We did internships, faced a recession as we entered the job market, and worked hard. A big part of millennials attitude and skill set that no one talks about is our unique ability to problem solve and troubleshoot, especially with technology and the internet. This is because we wanted to figure out how to use it growing up, so we already were accustomed to “figuring things out” and that was our motto when it came to jobs, especially as the recession subsided. If there was anything a job required, in the interview, I would explain how I could figure out how to do the task. Employers like that can-do attitude, especially if that person follows through. We did endure a lot of unpaid or low paid work but from that came an internship backlash or reckoning and I do think that’s why internships are mostly paid now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Corpos: "You gen Alphas are lazy!"  Gen Alpha: "You hired tin skinned clankers instead."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “Gen Z don’t want to work overtime” is a crazy statement because 40 hours a week is already overtime.  Studies have shown that the optimum working hours for a human are 4 hours a day.  Before all this stupid society crap happened humans only needed to work 2-3 hours per day to meet their basic needs.  Humans aren’t made for 40 hour weeks. That’s already overworking.  And boomers will talk about “the luxuries of modern life” as if playing half finished video games while we starve in 2 bedroom apartments with our 6 roommates is in any consolation.  Realistically a work week should be 20-26 hours on the high end and cover basic essentials for living. Any other work should fund any “luxuries”.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @omnomgamer8633 translation, you want other people to pay for stuff so you don't have to work. How are you gonna afford anything working twenty hours a week?

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Tbf, I wouldn't pay someone who couldn't spell "millennial", either.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Just_some_guy_1 they are probably just more intelligent than we are/were. Hard work yields you nothing in today's economy. If you constantly work fulltime but still can't afford a basic life, then something is fishy.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here and it was such a slap in the face when this happened to me. I worked overtime hours on a ridiculous project that was crucial, and I wound up getting severe eye strain and two anxiety attacks in the process. And they told me “meets expectations”. Never again
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @hechovisto  You learned a life lesson early in your life, good for you.   I learned the same lesson back when I first started working in 1990 when I was 23.  Since then, I've been 'quiet quitting' for DECADES!    This was long before their was a name for it.    Any parent, grandparent, uncle, aunt, etc. should have told you this lesson.   I used to work with HS school kids all the time in scouts, and I told all of them what life was like.  Realy, ti shouldn't come as a shock.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @hechovisto  I had to work through my lunch breaks at my corporate job—without extra pay—during a period of food insecurity. Fuck this whole system.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @hechovisto  millennial here also did the same thing you did and all I got was thanks for doing such a great job no raise actually that’s not true. I got a $. 50 Cent raise what the fuck even is that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: my department told us straight up there will never be any raises. when they ask me to work faster i laugh and tell them i cant
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Last year I was working about 70 hours a week- 30 hours of it being unpaid overtime. I kept getting reviewed as “needs improvement”,  despite knowing I was doing well, and it ended up causing me to have a mental breakdown. When the data came in, I had surpassed, by far, every single person in my department. I cried staring at the computer screen as the data rolled in, because I had been so broken down, and the data felt like a miracle and I was so happy knowing the entire time it wasn’t me- my boss was just a horrible person. There needs to be accountability for workplace abuse- I left that place but I’m still severely anxious all the time because of it, and am struggling from perfectionism OCD. It’s not acceptable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @​JamiesChaos  There are laws even in right to work states regarding unpaid overtime and hours with salaried employees. You should really check with your state as you may have a case for back pay! There are limits to how little you can be paid with how many hours you put in and even salaried employees are supposed to get extra pay if the hours are too high.  Hope you are feeling better!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @JamiesChaos  I can relate. I have an upcoming review in a few days and as soon it was put into my calendar my manager messaged me asking to see my current work. It's a quarterly review but he likes to focus the work I am doing right at this very moment, that is still work in progress, trying to find any issues or mistakes instead of looking at any of the work that I have done this past quarter )and received plenty of praise for just not from him). I am already dreading this meeting, knowing he will only bring up whatever he thinks I not doing well as usual...sigh.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same experience here.  My manager is lovely but the process is designed so that very few will ever be rated higher because the budget isn't there for lots of higher ratings .  Was a tough pill to swallow the first year , but now I've learned to accept it .   Just assume you will never get any meaningful in-post raises . Do your job and any extra projects you find interesting , then when you want a raise look for a promotion or Post elsewhere .   Don't understand why companies would rather spend more on new hires than invest in current employees but hey , that's what they want to do . 🤷‍♂️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @forestdaydreams9447 It’s cheaper for them to be understaffed and on rotation of hiring people and people quitting, so they can pay them the starting rate— the lowest possible. This sounds plausible does it not?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm in a role where I had to give employee reviews. I put 9-10 out of 10 for all areas on the questionnaire because they did their job. Then I was told a 5 is if they did their job. It's ridiculous.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got "meets expectations" all because I couldn't attend all of the monthly meetings. My job is open 24/7. So one month the meeting would be at 7am and then the following month it would be at 3pm and then rotate again. I worked 2nd shift, so I could attend the 3pm as that is the begining of my shift, but I couldn't attend the 7am and I was sleeping (I don't get home until 12:30am) and I'm not about to sit in traffic for 1.5 hours to attend an in-person meeting that only last 30 minutes. So I only got "meets expectations" along with the rest of the 2nd and 3rd shift. But 1st shift got the max bonus as they are able to attend all the meetings since they are at the start of their shift or the end. Awesome!!!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As someone who used to be a straight A student, I was so offended by my “meets expectations” performance review despite only being told that I am doing so well. I am coming to peace with the fact that these reviews are an inaccurate representation of my value.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I love when jobs make it seem like it’s your fault they aren’t giving you raises because you’re doing what they feel is the bare minimum. It’s on purpose. They don’t actually want to pay you more. They’re actively trying to find ways to pay you less.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: omg this bruh i worked at a hospital for a year and a half and i worked my ASS off to the point i had some health issues and my employee review was average. didnt try as hard after that and received a bare minimum raise
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @dumplingg  exactly I got the same thing on my employee performance review. I was like OK well if I’m meeting expectations, I’m not gonna go and do more work and go above and beyond what I’m giving you is what you’re gonna get and especially if you’re paying me $15 an hour yeah you’re getting $15 an hour worth of work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I didn’t even get “meets expectations,” instead I was told that they “understand that you have intellectual challenges” (referring to my autism) and that I needed to work even harder to compensate for it because my best wasn’t good enough.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @heartofthewild680 if you can get written evidence of this, you may be able to sue for discriminatory work practices. That is such offensive language and awful to blame you. Sorry you experienced that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I didn’t even get “meets expectations,” instead I got called “intellectually challenged” (referring to my autism) and told that my best wasn’t good enough and I “have the potential to do better.”  And I also got screamed at in front of customers, twice (thankfully the customers who witnessed this were willing to stand up for me, although they seemed less concerned that I was getting screamed at and more annoyed that it was happening in front of them)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: At my job, meets expectations is defined as "meeting OR EXCEEDING expectations!" So if exceeding expectations is the same as meeting expectations, why would I ever attempt exceeding expectations?!?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yep. It is never enough. "Continuous Improvement" is many companies motto. It really just never allows you to just do the job you were hired for, and nothing gets better.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I recently talked to my mother about what it was like for her growing up during the height of the gulf war, the Vietnam war, the Korean war, the space race and the 70s political activism in Australia and one of the questions she didn't have an answer to- she kind of just went silent was "how do you expect people to know if they never experience the things you did or you never tell them?"  Gen Z has got an utterly fucked world to deal with but so much of the fighting about this stuff between people in response to what is happening feels like either an amalgamation of "what have the Romans ever done for us??" or "you ought to join the people screaming at street corners yelling "death to Arasaka"  I don't know- what scares me is the sheer cold apathy that most people now seem to have or the creepily gleeful enjoyment I've seen in some people in watching the world flake into the dirt
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In my industry, the reward for working hard and coming in every day (an industry with super high turnover) is more work piled on and less likely to lose your hours...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I used to overwork too, but that's just because I get bored easily. It does suck at promotion time
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Or in my case, no matter how hard I worked, I always got "Needs improvement" on my performance evaluation. Why should I stress myself out if you're just going to say it's no good anyways?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here: it was the first financial product my company had launched in 20 years (linked to the government). Chosen to design and deliver training to 5 sets of agency employees, and manage them as they processed orders for the next 6 months. It was so hard, the most stressful thing I ever did and after 5 months of doing this for no extra pay, I went off sick. Took 3 people to do what I was doing.  "meets expectations" I was furious AND STILL AM
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So true, I used to work seasonal at different locations for the same company and every year was a performance review, and i was very talented & skilled at my job but at the start of the season, every manager marked me way low at the start of the season and then marked me what i actually am at the end of the season, so that they can take all the credit for my "improvement"!?!????????????? Hello!?!???? 😭😭😭😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Never forget, performance reviews are always supposed to make you feel like you're not doing enough. It's toxic and insane, and has clearly worked considering productivity is through the roof, but not wages. If you're going to get paid the same and told you're not doing enough no matter what, never do beyond what you're expected 😊
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nowadays doing the same exact thing would mean that you would receive even more work. That is everything they'll give you for performing up and beyond.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They do that on purpose, so you keep doing more for the same pay. I hope you're okay now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What!? How could you stop busting your ass!? Think of the manager's bonus!!!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: one of my mates once said "dont give it 110% cos theyll see that as the norm, so give it around 80%"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Agree on this, thats why i just do the same plus 1% every year, get meets expectations anyway so lets go! When i think i can get a raise i just jobhop.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My boss told me to work harder, so I did. Wanna know what she asked my co worker? “Why is she working so hard?”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: you could do 2x the work ethic only to get slapped in the face with $1 raise, its not worth it, better to invest that time building up something else
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is my entire childhood. I had perfect grades, I was quiet in class, caused no troubles. I was also creative, gifted in writing and arts. On paper, the ideal student, right? Nope. I got the same comment every year: "Good work, but doesn't participate enough in class and bad handwriting". Now, in my brain, "perfect grades" means "good", not excellent, or brilliant, but "good". And no matter how good my work is, how creative I can be, I will always think that it means nothing until I also have a good handwriting and talk louder than the others. Also, none of my teachers remember me. They remember the class clowns and the guy who actes like douches. They don't remember the quiet, hard-working, gentle kids.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: College is legal corporate share cropping
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a high schooler who goes to a school with an EBR (Evidence Based Reasoning) grading system.  For each test there is a scale for 1-4. 1 is developing, practically meaning you either didn't do the work or failed the test. A 2 is called approaching expectations, and it's anything from barely not failing to <90%. A 3 is called Meets Expectations. If you get a majority 3s in a standard or half in an increasing order (like 2-2-3-3) you can get a 3 for that standard. Every class has multiple standards. Some tests only count for one standard while others count for multiple. 4s do exist, and they're called Exceeding Expectations. You'd think it'd be worth it to get a 4, but it's only for your prude. In reality, they count for the exact same as a 3, but are a few times harder to get. Most of the time they require out of class understanding or skills that get taught later in class. For STEM classes, a 4 can only be achieved if you answer a level 4 question, which may not even be on a test. For all of semester 1 this year there has not been a level 4 question in my AP Calculus BC class or my AP Computer Science A class or my Principles of Engineering class.  For an example of how the system works, a calc test has 4 standards. Standards 1 & 2 are about actually solving the problem, standard 3 is about explanations, and standard 4 is about notation errors and the like. If you get a 3 for every standard, then you get an A. A single 2 for any standard is a B. Multiple 2s are a C. A single 1 in any standards is a D or F for the class.   For an English class however, the standards may work differently. In my AP Language and Composition course, there a 3 standards, with each test counting in only 1 standard due to their nature. Standard 1 deals with analyzing passages, and so only Rhetorical Analysis essays are placed there. Standard 2 is about participation, so discussion and reflection grades go here. Standard 3 is about writing, so all the argumentative essays and creative writing are lumped in there.   It's a complicated system unique to each class and is detrimental to the students taking it. It both makes it easy to scrape by if you're barely good enough at each standard and the teacher likes you. However, if the teacher doesn't like you, it's very easy to give you a 2 and block you from achieving an A. My school is very competitive and a B or less is sometimes a cause for teasing in friend groups and lowers your social standing. And don't get me started on parental pressure. Even if your parents stop pressuring you the pressure becomes self enforced.   A lot of other students I know cheat extensively on exams, from learning questions and answers for a math test or learning a prompt for an essay, or simply straight up lying to a teacher for an extension. A lot of people miss tests so they can take them later and have additional prep time. I don't know anyone who genuinely likes their classes and would go to them if they weren't required for college applications. Well, not technically required, but practically.  All of this basically ends up with students cheating, lying, working their butts off to get a grade that says that they simply met expectations. A grade that feels meaningless in a meaningless class. A majority of the people in my AP English class don't plan to go into a career anywhere near Language and Composition.   If you're curious, the school is Adlai E. Stevenson Highschool and the system is only in place because our principal gets money from it and from endorsing it. If your school is considering it, please either switch to another school or convince them not to. A longtime teacher left the school and published a report detailing all the issues with the system and why he left because of it.   TLDR: My school has a BS grading system that doesn't make sense and states that doing your all is simply "meeting expectations".
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: One thing that Corporate hates doing is paying their bottom line, it is considered a lost in profits for them but they know if they don't pay the bare minimum, then nothing will be generated. The bare minimum is even if your output on your work is above and beyond, that will just be considered the new baseline requirement, which means more productivity, less hires, more workload, and more profits to the top.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: that's why I quit the "job" game to work for myself. so much happier. life feels riskier and unpredictable but at least I'm happier with what I do every day and I receive the recognition I deserve.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THIS!! I’m a Gen Z and at my first job i worked my ass off for $21AUD an hour (minimum wage at the time). i was going 10-12 hour shifts just to keep up, but didn’t get a pay rise because i “don’t answer enough phone calls” but they just didn’t wanna pay me(i answered as many phones as i could) I left for basically the same job that paid $32 an hour. I loved that job so much, but they refused to pay me more even though i was going wayyy above and beyond. it really warped how i view the workplace, i never go above and beyond anymore because what’s the point? you don’t get appreciated for it, it just becomes a new baseline of what they expect from you. it’s disappointing!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: During my yearly review every year, I was told that it is impossible to get a 4. I was always getting 3s, going above and beyond & after I was told that, I just did my job. No above and beyond. Guess what I got? All 3s yet again. It doesn’t get me anything to bust my ass & stress myself out, so I just do my job.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh absolutely, at the job I'm leaving right now I learned so many different departments and they had a productivity percentage where expectation was like 85% and I was consistently getting over 100% productivity rate and I would volunteer for so many things and try to help other people. "Meets expectations" across the board. I had already decided to quit but felt really good about my decision when my raise was 68 cents.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The only criticism I've got in 3 years of my first job is that I need to iron my clothes. Meanwhile I regularly disassociate at work for an hour or more.

Safe to say i dont even look in the work group chat unless im going into work that day. They dont pay me enough to know how to run the whole store as a lowly sales guide👍🏼
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Lotta replies so I don't know if it's been said, but they HAVE to put "meets expectations" because if they put actual higher marks, it means in a corporate sense you deserve a promotion. They don't want that, so they give mid remarks.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I work in corporate and was told “ you will always meet expectations” nobody gets an “exceeds expectations”. I was shocked because I work hard and it shows, it definitely makes me want to put in less effort but I get rewarded with more work. This is no way to live.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Because if employers put anything better than that then you can justify asking for a raise. Management is literally encouraged to undermine your work.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Never heard of anyone getting higher than “Meets Expectations” where I work. I assume because at my job if you do you get a pay increase immediately. Not saying I deserve this but some people I work with really do. Then we have the people that don’t do anything ever but the boss won’t fire them because they aren’t paying attention/don’t care. This is why we will tell our higher ups we hate our jobs to their faces sometimes because then they would have to do the extra work of finding someone else to do your job aka you do your job well enough so who cares.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Absolutely horrible. I'm so sorry. I understand completely. I used to work as a server and I went above and beyond for my tables for years. My abusive boss at Red Lobster used to schedule me 70+ hours a week with no breaks. My body started literally shutting down towards the end before I threatened to quit. My tables stiffed me constantly over making small mistakes like taking 15 minutes to bring a coffee and other drinks to the table without apologizing for the delay from the fresh coffee brewing etc. I made $2.13 hourly. I realized no one would ever see me, care, give me a raise, or tip me enough to make up the abuse. I left.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just passed over for a promotion and full-time hours despite doing more work than other with a full-on disability.... I'm tired. I'm done.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh man I feel this. I work in apartment maintenance and I do good work yet the hire ups still find things they think were doing wrong. We need to find work arounds because they don’t give us enough of a budget.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You have to bust your ass working on yourself and not the job. I mean that you always have to learn and get better at something. Identify what those skills are so even if you get fired, you will still take those skills with you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was such a hard worker up until 22, when I was quickly approaching needing to get my own health insurance and couldn’t find a job that would cover me fully, or hardly at all.   My parents reminded me every year. Finally at 27, after 2 years with no health insurance anxious every day, I just got married even though I don’t believe in marriage. I had no choice. My husband has the best insurance we could possibly have from his union job, that he got because his dad works there and has worked there for over 20 years.    (He knows I don’t believe in marriage. He’s a good man. He just wanted what’s best for me.)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was told outright in a woman dominated company the only way to get better pay (I’m at the bottom of the pay scale that average for others with same title in company is $30k+) was to leave the company.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My wake up call was when I worked overtime 10-20 hours a week for a year only to find out I took home LESS than my average gross take-home pay because my overtime was taxed to hell.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It does. A little bit of motivation and incentives to continue high standards of work go so far, but too many companies act like these are very difficult things to accomplish
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, that’s why when my boss gave me my performance review last time it said meet expectations. I basically said OK. Well you wanna watch me not meet expectations and do literally the bare minimum and I’m sure my productivity is dropped, but I could give a fuck less, I work in a grocery store by the way with a bunch of idiots.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I knew a guy who worked in retail management and somebody above him warned that they are NEVER SUPPOSED to mark anything above meets expectations. He was told this by them because he got really irate because of everything he did to set our ecommerce team up for success and running the show as a lower manager(which wasnt even his responsibility btw he wasnt even supposed to do schedules) the actual boss was on a loa due to becoming a parent so he was gone a few months.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I took a different approach from the start as a ‘95 zillenial; never give a shit and I can never get disappointed.  Eventually you get promoted because it’s “your turn” and it feels like a bonus out of no where.  Win win.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I did this at safeway, as the frozen manager and they just took hours out of my department to force me to work even harder to maintain the homeostasis of my department.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And heres the thing "meets expectations" is the most a manager is allowed to give in some places, they are not supposed to put "exceeds" its like the 4 out of 5 stars thing. If 5 out of 5 is not allowed why is there 5??? like hello???
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why keep busting your ass when you still never get anything to show for it in return
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: literally just happened to me. idk how freaking recover as a previous overachiever child genius who has never failed cause failing means costing us more money and we broke broke.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same here. Your reward for doing your job well is more and shittier work. And you know what happens when you don't get the extra pile of shitty work done in time? You get a reprimand. My parents always thought me to strive for an A or A+, but it literally only gets you more shit on your plate. 16y/o me was right. The best grade to get is a C.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yup, I did double the work I needed to because I wanted to do the best I can and not disappoint anyone. All that got me was more work and less staff with me. If I could the work of two or three people, why hire and pay multiple people when they can just have me?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, I drive for a living. I'm having health issues I needed to be off for, so I could get tested... for cancer.  When I got back on the road, that pay periods paycheck was terrible. Even with the time I took off I'd never had one that bad.  I said something about needing to get the miles because this paycheck sucked.  I got "Well, You've been taking a lot of time off lately." WTF!? I took 3 days over 2 months! And that's "a lot of time off."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 100%, used to work til 2am in a 9-5 job delivering the outputs of 2 staff thinking surely that would help me succeed. Nope. It's all luck, does your superior leave their role or not, does a good job come up somewhere else, are you at the org at a time of expansion or contraction. We're not in control, so why pretend we are... bs. I now log off at 6 and don't check in again.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh my god. My first monthly review it was explained to me that I would never recieve "exceeds expectations" on my reviews because of some bullshit corporate reason. So glad I quit that job wothout notice.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 🚩🚩Because that is what Humankind has been doing for Centuries, and we seem to be the only Generations ( Z and Millenials ), that won't work unless we became Rich. ✨️✨️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @martapriya98 i dont want to be rich, i want to have a modest home and retire one day. Grfo of here with that nonsense.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 🚩🚩Because that is what Humankind has been doing for Centuries, and we seem to be the only Generations ( Z and Millenials ), that won't work unless we became Rich. ✨️✨️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was the only one running my entire department for a full year, literally the only person in the department, and I got a meet expectations. Stopped busting my ass after that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Walmart gave me a 15 cent raise one year because I needed more "handheld process knowledge" I taught my new team lead how to use the handheld that year....
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: exactly. I even used to be really ambitious and I still love what I'm doing, but the corporate environment needs to change completely, as it sucks the life out of people. What do we even need reviews for? Why do we need hours and hours of meetings? One year I got two reviews one saying "needs to try harder in xyz" the next one a few months later "is doing too much on xyz" That's when I stopped caring alltogether. On a different job I had full marks on all reviews, then I got laid off because they started hiring offshore and after having climbed a couple of steps because they wanted me to, I suddenly became too expensive for them. It's just not worth it. As much as I love doing my job, managers don't know what they are doing and keep criticising for no reason, just to pretend that they are working. And let's face it we will end up all poor when we are old, so there's no incentive left to try hard.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was always the first on on my team to come in, and the last to leave. And I got laid off just a week ago. Was told on my exit meeting it was nothing to do with ky performance. On my termination paper, it stated “did not meet executive and management expectations and role requirements.” Never again am I putting so much of my own life and time into a company.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, I stopped trying to appease my management when my hard work wasn’t paying off. Stopped doing extra, literally bare minimum so they couldn’t fire me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What’s even worse, is a lot of old people don’t understand the job application process these days. They think you can just walk up in a place and ask to speak with someone, and maybe fill out a 1-2 page application. It’s not 1960 anymore and it’s not a 15-20 minute process anymore… for some jobs you have to sign up on their online application portal, then after uploading your resume you gotta answer questions that end up being a repeat of your resume, then the cover letter, list of references, reference letters, etc… then you might, if you’re halfway lucky, end up with several phone or virtual interviews just to end up not getting the job. I mean you could literally spend nearly 15-20 hours worth of work on just one such prospective job… Rinse and repeat.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @lmitchell3604  My absolute favorite part is when the application AI auto-rejects you because you didn't use enough key words in both your responses AND resume. Meaning you have to cater your resume to every individual application (and remember, you still have to answer the redundant questions using those same keywords) and thus spend even more time on the application just to have a chance at an actual person glancing at it. And sometimes it'll auto-reject you again because you've basically been blacklisted for getting auto-rejected the first time. Yup. I sure am lazy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @lmitchell3604 - Going through this right now for a job at USPS. Their application took me 2 hours to fill out and then I had fill out 5 more forms that repeated themselves over and over. And finally after all that I got a job offer, but I have to go drive 40mins to get fingerprinted. Oh and the cherry on top is just before I felt to get fingerprinted they rescinded their job offer. Mind you this is like my 200th application in the past two months.  I’m honestly ready to just give up. I feel as though life as a Gen-Z is like swimming through concrete.  Not to mention a studio apartment is about $900 a month, so what luck do I have finding a job that pays enough that I have 3 times the rent payment. Which is still required where I live.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@lmitchell3604 seriously. My dad was super incredulous when when I mentioned I'm generally spending 4-6 hours a day applying for jobs so I cant really spend 8-9 hours working for 1/3rd minimum wage at an industrial shop where im not even an employee (which is obviously illegal, but whatever). I am having to remake my resume and write a cover letter for every god damn job that will actually be able to cover rent (let alone food), that shit takes time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I especially love how "ghost job" listings exist, meaning even if an AI doesn't auto-reject you, they weren't actually looking for hires at that moment at all
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Someone who graduated in finance from the same university as me applied to over 250+ jobs before getting a graduate level job.   They went to uni in Wales, and could only get a job in London, England, a different country.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: God I feel this in my soul so hard.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When will we stop using older generations for scapegoat?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Only problem is they pass on the old ways to the next generation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ I don’t know what “old ways” you object to but the old ways in referring to resulted in everything that makes your life comfortable
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The problem is they don't and they will still be alive for so long😢
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: time for an astroroid to hit ig
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not true. People have to intentionally break cycles and teach the next generation to be better. If old ways of thinking went away with each generation dying off, racism and homophobia would not still be big issues. But unfortunately… just look at where we are.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The problem is that these are some resilient mfers
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @ronaldojoe3011  They run on sheer spite
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've had people tell me in job interviews that they were scared to hire me because they thought I would just leave like some other people in their past for better opportunities just because I have a degree. Like, what? I'm trying to learn and practice more skills and also succeed in living by myself. These old people are the reason why a lot of people my age are stuck working minimum wage jobs with crazy hours. And then most of the people in my state (Mississippi) are too stupid to understand what I can do with my degree. No wonder a lot of people just leave this state.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @lordofwarsandfire  hello fellow MS resident! I went to vet school at MSState. The state raised tuition on instate students because they did a survey and found out after getting a degree most students leave the state. Instead of making the state a better and more attractive place to be, the gov cut funding to the school. Yep, that’s a great way to retain a necessary workforce.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I thought that's why we had Covid. ? What went wrong?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Tne problem with that... boomer is now becoming a mindset for a lit of Gen Xers and older millennials.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Was honestly thinking of exactly just this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So in short nothing will Change unless heads rolls. Viva la revolution.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @michaellyga4726  I thought that engendered more hate.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The funny part is, Gen Z thinks you'll build a work free utopia once you're in power.    When the reality is, the Western World will probably just collapse because none of you know how to read and can't order a pizza without having an emotional breakdown.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @twelvecatsinatrenchcoat  the younger generations will probably be the ones to help many issues, like SA, climate change, elderly/animal rights, monopolies, insurance issues, etc. because they've already noticed how terrible the laws are for these issues at their young age.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wrong. You to will become part of the slave system just as those b4 you. Gen Z is delusional dont worry you're snapping out of it and only have 50 more yrs of slavery b4 you can be old and homeless. Keep voting blue its working. Boomers did the same shit. America is finished.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's because the system DID serve the interests of those older generations, at least to a much larger extent than it did the current generation. The policy changes that made everything so unlivable only happened AFTER those older generations already made their stake.They can't seem to fathom that things have gotten so bad that you can't just work your way to the top anymore because they grew up in a system where they could and did.  I saw it described pretty well in another video's comment section, so I'll paraphrase it here: it's like if your grandfather bought a brand new truck when he was 16, then later passed it down to his 16-year-old son who didn't maintain it properly and left it in a barn to rot. Then, when it was time for you to learn to drive, your dad and grandfather dug up the old truck. Your grandfather remembers it being the best vehicle he ever had, your dad remembers it being reliable but outdated, but as it stands, it's now a rusted old piece of junk that can barely get you from point A to point B without threatening to fall apart. Without making either of them work on or drive the truck themselves, how do you convince them that the truck you've been given isn't the same truck it was back when they learned to drive it?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @limetime9045  Guess why baby boomers in early adulthood had it pretty well-off economically.  That's right, the dominance of Keynesian economic policy.  Since Reagan, our fiscal policy has been neoliberal and more focused toward corporations.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @limetime9045  There shouldn't be a need to convince them and their inability to see that just makes them delusional to nostalgia, you can only abandon them and go your own way until you can get your own truck unfortunately.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not to mention we are so alienated from what we even do. Everything is SO compartmentalized it feels like numbers on a screen and nothing more
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yep it sounds normal to me to reject an 8am meeting on a Monday for a workout class, especially if it's not the normal thing and you don't have anything in your contract that says you must be available at that time. Proud of that girl for setting boundaries !  In my office (given it's a big city where many have long commutes) we rarely set any meetings before 10am or after 5:30pm without asking. We know people may be taking kids to school, cramming in a doctor's appointment or a workout session on some days outside those times. If the person is always available when they're supposed to be and gets their stuff done, it seems fair to me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Rachel-uq1bn  This might be normal for women.  For men this is lazy.  So it makes sense.  Better go get your hair appointment in while I do all the work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The more a try to achieve my dream the more i work and work. Then the more i spend for health and insurance. Its endless cycle
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m sure a big part of the thought process is “I’m offering $30k/year for this position, why wouldn’t they want that?! I bought a mansion and a 911 Turbo with that salary 50 years ago.”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm Gen X and I feel sorry for Gen Z because life is so much harder. I totally understand where everyone in the comments is coming from. Bashing generations below you has always happened, but in all seriousness, it continues to get more difficult for each generation as time passes.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm living that same 'work that makes you broke' reality. I work fulltime, in a tech job. I can barely make ends meet. I don't need to earn a fortune, I'd like to make enough so I could do a bit more with my money than just paying bills. I'm now facing the reality that I probably won't be able to afford retiring. I never expected that to be a reality.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @wowthungsten  On the one hand, I'm sorry you're going through that realisation. On the other, once you're through it, it's very liberating. You're no longer trapped by the myth of retirement and you can start planning your career in a more sustainable fashion because you now understand it HAS to be sustainable. We are working to live, we are working class (despite all those degrees and specialist training) and we make the best of it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Cuz the system itself is completely broken now
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The younger generations will probably be the ones to help many issues, like SA, climate change, elderly/animal rights, monopolies, insurance issues, etc. because they've already noticed how terrible the laws are for these issues at their young age.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For me then came questioning and going back to therapy/counseling twice for the mental health issues we get from existing in this culture
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No life is not a given. You make it. Not your parents.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: A lot of older people agree with you its a slave system and basically unless your uncle owns the store it aint worth the effort.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm wondering what took so long for this to happen;  This has been obvious to me for years.  The only reward for doing good work is more work so why not slack off?  Office Space is an instructional video.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Human beings are biologically wired to be lazy. It stems from conserving calories during the vast amount of evolution when food was scarce. GenZ are just taking the brunt of the unrealistic expectations presently. Every generation has been labeled lazy by older generations. I work with many GenZers and they are excellent at their jobs and we often learn from eachother.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ Agree, I learn more from people who are younger than me, than from people who are older these days. My elders just seem like a bunch of nepo babies who never learned anything worth passing on because they never needed to.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @codebloke2200  I agree. We are also supposed to be hunting and gathering, which doesn’t require you to work all that much believe it or not.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’d say that millennials and a good chunk of gen x understand the struggle. But the loud voices of the majority of baby boomers are complaining about the new generation.  I’m a millennial and I got nothing but respect for gen z. They are very hard workers. And they actually know their value and want to be treated as such.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm xenial and I feel it been like this since college, but we were taught to endure and grind. I'm 46 and have never owned a home, still have student loan debt, and struggle to raise and take care of my.family. I now have a 20 year old who can't get a job. It kinda sux all around.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yup as a millennial i see both sides of the argument and i side with Gen Z !
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @sergiolandz6056  Same. I've been treated terribly and they've been treated even worse. Nobody deserves this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No we don't, we perfectly understand. We lived through seeing our parents generation working decent jobs and getting a decent house.  Then we got above average jobs + student loans and could afford accomadation that was the same as the very poor people in the older generation had.   Younger people have it even worse. We understand because things have been getting worse and worse for our entire lives too.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There is no good life without classic education. But with so many non westerners into US talking about Socrates or Aristotle is like presenting to a chicken a screwdriver.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This. The question needs to be asked, everyone needs to think on a solution
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 29 and a teacher. It's not that the system serves you, it's that there is a small way to make it work for you, and we zillenials learned it won't change. So it's more play the game right so that you can quit it earlier.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How can I prevent this from happening? This is happening to me and I'm 22, would I be able to request compensation somehow?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @HehoiHehoi  You're going to need to be aligned with the new ways coming into being rather than the ways that are dying out. That's all I can say with confidence.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No the system still works, you just don't want to put the effort in that it requires to make it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @GR-bn3xj  Exodus 5:4-18 There is nothing new about the way you carry on. Its like is recorded in the most ancient of writings.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We (Gen x, in this case) understand the system is dumb and broken, but we also understand if we like not being homeless or hungry, we work. And many of us are working our asses off while adult children mooch and talk about being burnt out before they ever get a job. Ooohhh Kay.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @banchara  I mean, people do work hard and they still don’t make the bare minimum. That that’s what you don’t seem to understand.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @banchara  You're talking to an elder millennial, probably only a few years younger than yourself. Work has for many, become a path into poverty instead of out of it. There is no point telling people they need to work to eat if they aren't being paid enough to afford to eat.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This entire generation is r/iam14andthis is deep, but ya'll are like full 25 years old now still saying the same stuff like it's deep.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There is no such thing as a perfect system. Adult life is about trade offs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Tusk_Tact  true and people are weighing the trade-off
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@Tusk_Tact The system is working less in gen z's favor than for previous generations
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You aren’t going to walk in the door and be in the same position as people who have worked for years.  The people you are jealous of had to work their way up as well.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ Been in the workforce for over a decade, never been promoted internally even once. Everyone else I know, same story. There is no way to work your way up, the ladder has been pulled. Never seems to sink in to the elders: Young people are being offered NOTHING in the way of career advancement. You can do a great job, talk to your boss, get all the certifications in the world. Doesn't matter, you get nothing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We’re not asking for a nice house, we just want a house that’s livable. They have foreclosures listed for 250k+ where I live and they’re completely unlivable. Black mold, ceilings falling in, water damage, you’d be paying the house price, the price to tear it down, on top of rebuilding, just to have somewhere to live. How are we supposed to afford that with high student loan payments, inflation, and increasing grocery prices? We can’t do it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @mistianthorn7527  A house burnt down near the town I grew up in Florida last year. All that was left was the freaking FRAME and in fact  the pictures on zillow page for it showed the frame still smoldering with cinders. It was being sold for like 250k… a literal unlivable house. Yet all the boomers kept dissing on me for leaving Florida claiming “its super affordable actually” yeah right.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @mistianthorn7527 that's another issue. The infrastructure is falling apart. I worked in the trades it's getting bad. All those cut corners are coming back to bite people in the ass. All the galvanized water lines are literally crumbling. All the asbestos and bad fiber glass insulation is making it harder to renovate old houses. And every single thing is like this and that literally doesn't get better. Homes from even just the 80's are falling apart in places. Its almost a reflection of how society itself has pushed too far in how much sacrifices it's making.  People can't live sustainably anymore. And yet they just keep pushing expecting it to work somehow. The reason they call us lazy is to try and make us work for nothing and milk us as hard as possible. They've always done it. It'd been done to every generation. But eventually when you want more and more you hit a limit. It's almost ironic the houses themselves are rotting at the seams. Because the economy that built them is too.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @mistianthorn7527 there is a 4 bedroom house that is in a desired location in my city (NOLA) that doesn’t have AC (in the literal swamp of Louisiana!?!). It has holes in the walls and water damaged walls and possibly roof. Asking price is $500,000. My guess is that it needs at least $50,000-100,000 of work to make it livable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I will buy a house with literally three rooms I just want somewhere give me a bathroom a kitchen and bedroom just give me something.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Shit my dad bought a house working as a shift manager for Arby’s, that was only $10/h, I know cause I asked, I make $20/h right now, literally double, and the only “homes” I can afford are land with nothing on it, or one that will have to be tore down because it’s so bad, keep in mind he was raising two kids while being able to do this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Or literally just rent for an apartment and decent food that's not giving you cancer at 30 would be nice too.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “Gen z doesn’t want to have kids” how am I supposed to feed children when I cant afford to feed myself?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly. Being able to cover costs of living alone
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yup. Getting a comfortable life just from working hard is a complete historical anomaly, though. Silents and Boomers could get it. GenX could get there with two of hard working, well educated and lucky. Millennials needed all three. GenZ is just screwed. In most of history, hard work just got you basic survival, as long as nothing went badly wrong. We might be heading there again. (For completeness' sake, the only ways to get rich are from other people's work or other people's money.)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @autolykos9822  actually, it depends. If you live tribally and communally , it’s a lot less work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an elder Millennial working 40+ hours a week as an infant daycare teacher, I can concur…they don’t pay us enough to even cover the minimum bills to survive
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @stewarln52284  what on earth is an infant teacher? What can you teach an infant?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Almost as if the current socieconomic system is finally starting to show its cracks and people are starting to open their eyes to the incoherences of it...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When you feel like you're killing yourself for virtually nothing in return. When you live paycheck to paycheck because it's impossible to get ahead enough to do the things you want to do, like go out with friends, travel, or have a family. It's insane. Wages have actually gone down, my bf has been working his butt off trying to get key holder and assistant manager position at his job while he goes through school. Originally when he was hired he was supposed to make 16.80 after his probation period as a key holder. But he was informed after his probation that corporate decided it should only be 15 dollars an hour for the region he works in. How is that fair or just?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If the wages they are paying us are not even high enough to pay the basic bills then why are we all collectively STILL trying to keep this system running while sacrificing or lives, sanity and health? To be honest, I don't care about a system that doesn't even care if I am alive or dead. That doesn't even treats me as a human... I say, fuck that system and let it go down. And as far as I can observe, I am not alone in this sentiment. Terrible times are ahead
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There would be. But even further than that just make part time jobs pay enough and give enough hours that they can pay to stay alive without significant help
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It used to be that one person working the equivalent of a minimum wage job could support a family😢
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I shouldn't have to earn twice th average salary to be able to afford a 30 year mortgage for a shoe box of an apartment.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It would, and it use to be possible, that's not reality anymore
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 🚩🚩Because that is what Humankind has been doing for Centuries, and we seem to be the only Generations ( Z and Millenials ), that won't work unless we became Rich. ✨️✨️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly! I would just love to be able to buy groceries and go to college and enjoy my experience without having to worry about whether or not I can afford my medication or therapy. If I could work a job that would do that, that would be my dream job!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Or if we could even get a “9-5”. 8-5 sucks and my financial situation sucks more. Even if my financial situation didn’t improve my mood and energy levels would if I got the same “benefits” for working 9-5.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: House and family ? Just want rent and cost of living to match my income !!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is why the echos are turning into shouts. For someone and minimum wage today to have the same buying power as a boomer working minimum wage had in the 60s, today’s minimum wage would have to be $66 per hour As much as it pays me to admit this gen z must do everything they can to get a leg up while this economy continues to crash so that when it soars we can thrive instead of waiting for it to save us, we cannot rely on it. We must learn to grow in a dog shit economy, so that we may reap the benefits of a strong economy. So the seeds of the future you wish to see foot in a single seed lies the promise of a forest.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Almost like this is the entire point?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Erm, but actually uhhh, any job that isn't being chief engineer or specialist doctor is meant for 14 year olds to do as a stepping stone, so paying them three Flintstone gummies an hour is justifiable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Dude, if that terrible office gave me the money I need to afford a small apartment....hell I'd take it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The reality is you still need to work. Even if it was a Marxist communist utopia, you’d still need to work. That basic fact should be enough to motivate anyone to find a job and do at least the minimum.  I’m a big union guy. I’m all for workers’ rights, fair pay, the whole package. But to have workers’ rights, there needs to be work. It hurts your bargaining or individual leverage when you don’t do the work to begin with.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My parents literally told me "you don't want to work" not as a generalization but as a warning that work wasn't fun when i was 8  Like yeah no shit gen Z doesn't wanna work, you don't either (not directed at my mom and pop they're great)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They used to call it “lying flat”, with the idea that you lie flat on the ground and do nothing. Interestingly, 无为 (wu wei) is a central idea in Daoism, which says to “do nothing” and let things be in accordance to the natural order
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @meostyles  Remembering a quote by colin mcrae, 'If in Doubt, go flat out'
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @meostyles  lying around doing nothing is not what wu wei is at all, Westerners especially take that concept very literally. Wu Wei means to not fight against the will of the universe, it doesn’t mean to literally remain motionless.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Dude, the no reward, only more work fucks with my mind a lot. When I was a kid in primary school I learned to never tell teachers when I finished work early because they would always give me more things to do.   And they looked at me weird for telling them why I kept quiet and proceeded to tell me "but you have to tell us!"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ I feel you, like this whole life is a scam
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Okay, that's a sick sounding movement!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an elder millennial, I can confirm that working hard is a waste of your life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The Chinese people took it further they went back to countryside to live as farmer and free 😂😂😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The reward is not being sent to a human experimentation camp
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nothing comes of it? If nobody works then nothing exists. We create the world around us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @brandonadams9203  What if I feel nothing but fear and disgust about the world that is being built around me? There is nothing I can do to reverse the global trends, only question left is do I contribute to this or do I not.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: whats the other option? being a leech on the system? pathetic
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @johnfisher8401  like the billionaires that do not see salutes?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @johnfisher8401  tell that to the 1%
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bernie was the other option. Now it’s time to accelerate.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The BS about “we’re all a family here” really gets under my skin too. We don’t want to be all buddy-buddy with our coworkers. We just want to be paid what we deserve and leave. Walmart is really bad with this, trying to get coworkers to do bonding exercises and volunteer. NO. Not apart of my job, I don’t care.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @amandabisby3546  Exactly! People are there to get PAID not to be apart of some corpo "family" or whatever.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @amandabisby3546  lol corporations will NEVER understand this because they aren’t a thinking and feeling entity, they’re just a structure (from the very top to the very bottom) of the same exact human beings who just want to get the job done and go home.  The company-culture HR execs who are hired to create all that crap only do it because they’re just trying to please their boss. And then that shit just rolls down hill. Everyone is faking it: from the CEO down to the cashier, because the shareholders must be kept happy and that’s all that matters.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Work is unfulfilling in many cases. You go in, do something in a nebulous void, and then leave. If you work as a farmer, youbsee your crops grow. If you work in manufacturing, you'll see the things you make being used.  But a lot of jobs feel like all you do is write something on a board just to erase it. Cyclical with no meaning to it. The only fruit of your labor is your pay but that's often not enough to get you excited to continue doing seemingly meaningless tasks all day every day
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @catelynh1020  I think we should encourage people to monetize their passions so they can create work they feel more pride in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @catelynh1020  I understand how not seeing the end result gets monotonous.   Try looking further down the line of processes to see that result.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 34 and I haven't held a "normal" job since I was in my 20s. I don't want to fucking work. I don't want a career. I want to be alive.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @lavahotpocket3886  I’m curious. What do you do?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @lavahotpocket3886  I feel sorry for your family.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Obviously not everyone is gonna have a job field they love, some people don’t like any sort of modern jobs. But most people will happily do the work and be good at their job if they’re paid enough to live a comfortable life. I don’t expect a McMansion, but at least a small 2 bed 1.5 bath that doesn’t cost me an arm and a leg just for the down payment
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just want to garden and make music.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a millennial and I feel this way too. Well said. ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm so exhausted all the time I can sleep for 8 hours, and feel dead tired again in ten minutes and sleep for another 8 hours.. I have no drive to even do the things I enjoy.  I just zone out now
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jessicameow614 yeah, thats how i feel and it crushes me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This, there is no joy in being a cog in the wheel, and throwing most of you happiness at the compromise at being socially acceptable or having enough money for basic needs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: exactly and the moment that you drop the façade your bosses act like you never done anything ever. Even if you still put in 100% or more. I cant stand working for corporations anymore.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm in a weird spot where I want to work, but with disabilities and ADHD that make it nearly impossible to get through an interview if I even get there. With a degree in a field that needs a minimum of 5 years of experience for "entry level" jobs, it's hard to get anything. I love working at a summer camp as it's fun and I can work around my differences, but it's so hard to get something for the rest of the year, so I've gone to freelancing. But even then, advertising myself sucks and is really hard. I'm very fortunate that I don't need to work all the time to get by (thanks to some inheritance money when some relatives passed and smart investments of family members), but I feel like I need to work to have the satisfaction of doing something beyond just personal projects and the occasional volunteer or paid tasks.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a millennial I get that, and I appreciate your perspective. I like my job some days and other days I hate and get home exhausted and frustrated. I think in previous generations companies cared more about employee retention and that translated to work life balance and good compensation. With each generation we lose more and more. The only reason I make decent money these days is because I’m part of a union. We need to bring organized labor back so we aren’t all fighting for scraps.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i dont think anyone wants to work, actually  no matter how much you love something, if your livelyhood relies on it, eventually you'll hate it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think us Gen Z should start treating customers based on how they treat our co workers and how they treat us.   Cause people with entitlement disease needs to relearn what they give they’ll receive back.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My dream job is to not have a job and still be able to live
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @sweetthesuperpup  so being a bum is cool SMDH
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Unless we love what we do, which is unlikely in this society, we just don't have the energy to care. I want to be a tailor, and I know I'll be way more fulfilled with it, but I hate customer service where I can't tell customers to get out when they're attempting to literally force me into giving them shit for free bcs they think I'm an asshole
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Lol this is me. My boss keeps trying to push this on all those workers under them. All while never accepting a no that doesn't have an excuse that has to do with work. Only changing things to benefit them while making things harder for us with explanations that only make sense in their heads.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I stopped going above and beyond because they aren’t properly compensating me for wasting more of my time and energy for a low paying job🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️ all i do is make it to me scheduled shifts, do my tasks, and repeat. These people are not getting the best of me when im already losing myself to maintaining an adult life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have a similar mindset. I’ll work because I have bills to pay but I hate that I have to. Sure maybe I’m weak but with work, sleep, and travel that only leaves me with 5-6 hrs a day to actually live my life. That’s 3/4 of my life gone just to survive. In a perfect world I’d contribute to society through volunteering and my children, not working for a wage. But hey you gotta do what you gotta do 🤷🏽
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's actually a thing I was always fascinated with. Like, how people know, that you don't like doing something, how they don't like doing it as well, how they see you actually doing it, but are still mad at you, cuz you don't do it with a smile on your face and, oh dear, have the audacity to articulate your thoughts on the process. Like, how that works?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Some people in the comments saying things like „grow up“ , instead of showing empathy for a problem that a lot if people, not just gen z, are having? 9–5‘s are not healthy or natural and nowadays often don’t get you the money you need to live a comfortable lifestyle. We are ALL trapped in this system and it’s truly sad
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I work and work hard on top of my disability, but I’m disillusioned and burnt out. My health suffers, I’m underpaid, and the expenses to live keep going up.   If these kids can survive doing the bare minimum, go off!! Maybe they have something to teach us too.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That’s adulthood, you’re on the right track and will be OK!  You are correct that you don’t need to be passionate about your job.  It’s a trap- focus on what you’re really good at and build from there.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes! This! I am not a genZ, but I totally am behind it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I agree with this so much like I can do a good job without caring about the corporation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m Gen X and I agree with you 100%.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's just like all other generations before you....
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: exactly, i perform just fine in my minimum wage job, then i go home, scream into a pillow and sleep for 6 hours. i’ll do it, and i’ll smile to a customer’s face, but i will never be able to say i like it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You sound like a disgruntled boomers lol. Not everyone gets a fun job and especially if you don’t want to work. So there you are just clocking in and out. And hopefully you go home and do something you enjoy. Because work is work and not fun. That’s probably the majority of workers and jobs out there. I think social media makes it seem like work should be fun and you make bank. This is capitalism. It’s not fair. It’s unfortunate. I do understand the wage and inflation and housing issues though; that doesn’t go unnoticed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's it girly preach🎉 We work to have a good life, not hard work to live a miserable life🎉🎉🎉
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This too, and I think that’s actually one of the biggest and best contributions you’ve made to the workforce. (millennial here.) I have and so many others that played by the rules, and have you even tried to flip the script to enjoy work, but at the end of the day we work to live,  and we don’t live at work. Life is outside of work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's perfectly fair, but it's also perfectly fair for the company you not promote you, and promote the person going above and beyond.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am 34 and I do wanna work because workaholic is in my blood. Not only I wanna provide for myself but investing in a career so I can get my mama and w bros into a better situation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Everybody feels that way. Its not a generation thing. Other generations just act like normal friendly people, not like they love their jobs, just dont act like a dxck with an entry level job, or do and don't expect anyone to want to promote you or pay you well if youre awful to be around.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you. I don’t want to make my work my life. That’s sounds miserable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: At least you are trying, I give you credit Hun, I hope things get a lot better for your generation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People who say “if you’re on time you’re late” are the people who are actually gonna break me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same with everyone that grew up with a phone/tablet in their hands
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nobody wants to work but you do it anyway
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as a millennial working one of those adult jobs (think lawyer, doctor, investment banker...) I don't wanna work either lolol and I'm carving out my career path and life choices so that I can have more WLB / do something I actually care about one day
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Find something meaningful which benefits everyone
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as a gen z I love my job and want to go to work. A lot of us are just too young to be in the field we want to be in or still dont know what we want to do. Its not working that's the problem, its finding a career that fulfills our values
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No one is pretending, stop being entitled narcissist
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a gen z, I don't WANT to work.  ...well that i guess is the problem
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: a) No one in Gen X ever woke up saying "Gee, I can't wait to get to my desk in the vacuum department at Fedco".  Not one.  b) Not one of us in Gen X ever talked about it, everyone knew you just had to work.  If you would consume, someone must produce the goods you consume.  This is immutable, it's actually physics.  Gen Z is the only generation in history that resists this to the point that they openly resent working.  You are probably average, in that most Gen Z accept that they HAVE to work and therefore they put in what they feel is "enough effort", and usually that's fine, I can say as Gen X most of you kids seem like good kids, I like most of you.  But we all know that your commitment to the team, your loyalty to your employer, is tenuous, and that is a BIG difference (and no, employers are not worse today, they are actually on average better toward employees).  And that the worst of you, and sadly I would put that at 25% or so of your generation, are just a net negative to employ, about 25% are a wash, and about 50% range from positive to heroes.  I think that 1/2 of you are either a wash or negative is the biggest eye-opener, as an employer.  FYI my company employs zero Gen Z.  We just can't afford it.  It's easier to employ Millennials and Gen X.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We all do t like to work but have to. Time to Grow up
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ find something you like doing then
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same, I earn minimum wage. The legal bare minimum. I'm not going above and beyond for that 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ellouisebadger849  I’m not either
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Then they said everyone was "quiet quitting" when in reality, we just aren't going above and beyond for no return.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​ @bkraussVLL reminds me of the related quote about how equality feels like oppression to those who are use to privilege. Companies got use to other generations going above and beyond and get bent out of shape that gen z is too smart for that bs
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "You worked above and beyond, and that's exactly the problem. We need you to go the extra mile here, y'know?"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah I’d another employer asks if I’d every gone above and beyond my pay also better go above and beyond
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @vminhope3040  when they say “you’re gonna wear multiple hats” and I ask “am I gonna get multiple salaries?” And apparently it’s “inappropriate” and “unprofessional” to request to be paid for the work I’m doing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If they want me to do more than what my contract explicitly states, they must pay me for it. Otherwise I'm just working more, seeing my family less and getting more stress for free. Many companies don't realize paying the bare minimum also means they can't demand like that. I could be working anywhere else for the same reward anyway if they fire me, so why lose so much for nothing?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @RaquelTA-p8n  because they don’t wanna actually put in the work to hire people and also on top of that the training that most jobs give isn’t really even training. It’s more like an insurance policy. If you do something stupid they can say oh well we trained this person for X amount of hours I don’t know why there was an accidentso that way you can’t come back and Sue and say I wasn’t trained.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I make 10 an hour. I put in 10 an hour work, but i put in more when I'm enjoying the task a bit
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @FireForger man you couldn’t get me to show up to work for $10… do you have a car that you can put miles on just do uber or uber eats if the car is old you’ll earn $14-15/hr uber eats on average with uber $21-25. Only downside is wear and tear on vehicle so what I do is work a regular job $15/hr-up for a bit let it crush my soul then move on to work for myself doing uber (plus other things) generally half the year
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah but real way isn't for the slimy leads, managers, directors, coworkers. They want drama and validation. Trust. Etc. it's ridiculous that they don't wanna give us decent rewards or pay what we do while claiming we do something wrong when we ask for a raise to be then let go etc    I'm late diagnosed autistic and did not realize back then how toxic it was for me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: same here i get paid the same that i work hard or do nothing in a day so i just take my time for everything now, i dont give a F anymore working hard is for suckers in 2025. Just do your job and go home until shit changes and it gets worst you lower the bar as well.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: At the same time, this is a philosophy that churns out products of chinesium quality. By the time we're 50, I mean you think the roads and services are shitty Now..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@alclay8689 Tbf training employees costs money in the short-term, and most shareholders are incapable of understanding the concept of long-term growth. Why waste money training young people? Surely, the 55yr old dudes with silicosis will carry their industry for another 50 years.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @alclay8689  You get what you pay for
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @alclay8689   As another commenter said, you get what you paid for.  Chinesium can either be bleeding edge top of the line, or cheap garbage.  All depends on how much you pay.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They were only doing what they knew best. When they were young, college was actually a good investment with cheaper cost and better job prospects. We just aren’t living in the same times and must now look into the future than stick to what worked in the past.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Too many people had corporate drone and debt pushing parents. The banks and universities love them for destroying their children.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same here. The kids aren't the problem, they know the world is stacked against them. And I feel for them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen z here, I think most of us knew before 18. I’d say most of us work as we’re paid (there are of course exceptions just like with every generation). Pay us enough to care and we probably will. Pay us an unlivable wage and we’ll probably put in the bare minimum because why do more work when all you get is a plate of tired and maybe a side of irritation as a thanks
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@thatonearoace I was sitting in middle school having to tell college advocates(predators) that I had no desire to go to college as I already was fed up with the school system, so I wouldn't be filling out anything indicating interest in a particular school.  How they reacted to that told me all I needed to know about what was really going on, the k-12 to college pipeline is real and they really wanted us to not think there were other options.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @thatonearoace  ancient millennial here- I think being born during or after September 11 thrust you guys into a world of cynicism. All you’ve ever known is “things suck.“
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I couldn't wrap my head around modern life starting at age 13 and it never improved 😂​ @thatonearoace
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I agree!!! They realize it’s BS in the first 6months of employment. Took me 3 years lol. I’m also on the border with gen z though
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Son, I'm proud of you. I was TWICE your age before I figured that out!" -- Homer Simpson
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We are all connected, information is everywhere, we know society is a pony scheme
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @mateusdavo yes that’s right you got it society is a con so treat it like a con
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I knew when I was 13 when I was struggling to get through middle school. It all felt like a waste of time
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm gen X my self, but I did decided not to have any kids, I just new that our kids will have it bad in the future, so decided not to bring my kid to suffer in this world full of greed😢 I believe now the that was a good decision I make.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m with you I’m genX 76 I hate and I do use the word hate but not in a violent way just disgusted with millennials but I love genZ they get it why wouldn’t they we raised them they are more like us raised feral latch key kids but on the internet
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm GenZ, I knew by age 9, back in 2013, when my dad left and my mom couldn't pay the bills of our 200k house that was half paid off, that there was no hope for me if I tried to brute force it, and that I didn't have the starting money or social platform necessary for doing anything more than being an underpaid wage slave. I had already given up by that point and have been living with my only known family, applying for jobs for the past 2 years to no avail. I'm thinking that my life is over as a fresh 20 year old. This world already shattered me when. I. was. 9. years. old. And the thing is, I'm not even the worst off, not even close.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was confused for a second because you said you were gen x and I thought you were saying you ARE 79, not that you were born in 1979, lol.  But yeah. Im Gen Z, and it's hard to imagine myself with a family because I cant even imagine myself out there on my own, let alone a husband and kids. My brother is out and I see him struggle basically every year, having to move because rent is going up or one roommate is leaving.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Might be that you didn't understand it until you were 40 is that when you were growing up and you saw your parents work, that was not the reality. I am given to understand that people working in the 60s and 70s did get paid what their work was worth and/or the economy was not so fucked that that money could buy them what they needed in life. The reality your kids saw was simply different.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @MyVanir  in the 1970s, American workers could make maybe 15% of the value they generated as income. Elites taking 85%. Now the number is closer to 10% average and 5-7% for Americans born after Reagan.,  In most of the world, that number was and still is closer to 1-3%. First the Western-Globalist elites take 90% of the wealth, then poor countries like in Africa have their domestic elites take another 90% of what reaches them, leaving the working population with about 1/10/10 = 1% of their labor value as income.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I knew when I was 16, when I had my first shitty job for like three months before they fired me for getting COVID (can't sue, the pharmacy screwed up my paperwork so badly somehow, think they got my entire year of birth so badly wrong they put 1905 instead of 2005, like how man, so I can't use that to show I was actually sick), and was treated like shit for "not being a team player" when I was trying to get diagnosed with severe sports asthma, as well as severe scarring in my throat and lungs that made it a million times worse
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z here, 27, no kids, can’t have kids, kids would send me into bankruptcy. Lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as a first generation american and gen Z i see right thru the facade of the american dream...smh
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z are just figuring out what took us forever to realize. Im 53 and truly understand that its not these younger generations fault but they are being so affected by the BS.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What makes you think life was meant to be easy? Pray do tell.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @testerbend9473  life is life. It is what it is. However, the society we live in is constructed by the few weathy at the expense of the majority.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 1979 too...the problem is I'm still supporting my 20 year old, I am the only parent. I have a13 year old as well. I'm drowning in debt. So, while I get Gen z and the issues they have with work, because we had these same issues, we can't support you guys forever. So how can we help each other?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: missx147 it's interesting you say that. I was born 1980 and I never wanted kids because I saw my parents be stressed and working all the time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 🚩🚩Because that is what Humankind has been doing for Centuries, and we seem to be the only Generations ( Z and Millenials ), that won't work unless we became Rich. ✨️✨️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Elder millennial here, and absolutely no one from Gen Z Ive talked to is lazy. They just see through the bullshit we call “work culture”, and are refusing to adapt to it like I did.   Lot of good it did me, its not like im sitting on a mountain of cash these days. Im unemployed thanks to a chronic health condition. I was kicked out of the system entirely because I failed it.   So I agree: FUCK THE SYSTEM.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My parents are gen x and they always worked and they didn’t even care about me going to college like at all
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 79 is not Gen X…you are solidly boomer, my friend.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @RedDuke777 born in 79 my dude we didn’t put the 19 that’s why we had y2k
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @RedDuke777 No boomer is born from 1946-1964. Gen X born from 1965 - 1980. Millennial is 1981-1997. Z is 1998- present.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was in a huge 101 class around 2000 when the professor told everyone they were the first generation of college grads that would live a lower standard of living than their parents.  The gasp was audible.  In the last 24 years that has been shown to be 100% true.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yea and then they still call us lazy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @alecdashark we are. I know tons of people who refuse to work because they don’t want to.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For real . Most college graduates I know can't even afford to rent a house to themselves , let alone buy one. Everyone is know lives with roommates .   Living in your own house was something you could do on minimum wage 30 years ago. Now you can't even do it with a degree level job. Working your ass off for half a decade to get the equivalent of a 1970s entry level lifestyle.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That is absolutely an untrue statement! I was around 30 years ago and you could not afford your own house on minimum wage! You all want to whine and say life's harder for you, that you have less advantages than those of us thirty years ago, and that's an absolute lie! At 15 years old, I was kicked out of my house on the street and had to provide for myself. I didn't get a college education, I dropped out in 10th grade and was working full-time. Yes, at the age of seventeen I was supporting myself working full time and not going to school. I have been married 27 years, helped raise 4 children (two of those went to college and got a degree), all while working jobs that made less than $30,000 a year. Stop blaming, whining, or making excuses for your life! School can help some people get ahead in life, but it's not a guarantee or a promise to a better life! Anyone can get a degree, doesn't mean they know anything or that they're qualified for anything! Thinking that paying a bunch of money for a degree, will guarantee you an easy life, is pure lazy behavior!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Speaking as a gen X and a parent of gen Z, your generation needs to make it clear to your parents that if they ever want grandchildren, it's on them to pay for that. If they can't put you in a house where you're not paying rent or mortgage, and provide a decent amount of childcare while you're building your career and also raising kids, then forget it.  The boomers made the economy how it is now, and my generation never figured out how to stop them. Therefore it's our responsibility to support our adult children to survive and thrive in the mess we've bequeathed them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The fact boomers could have a family and home with one income while dual income families struggle to even rent is crazy but it must be the avocado toast and Starbucks I keep hearing about being the issue.   I think it was 2022 the same people then asked why aren’t millennials buying avocados as they said they are the reason we are poor… apparently we can’t do anything right.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @WarWolf947 issue is literally caused by policies you support and promote
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The same generation that orders us to follow that lifestyle choice
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Maybe your parents were exceptional AND things were easier and more available then. I have friends with kids that are realizing that they CAN'T give to their kids the advantages that were given to them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Okay so all that info from college INCLUDUNG TOOLS AND EXPERIENCE GOOGLE AND THE LIBRARY SELLS THAT SHIT FOR FREE... I don't need a piece of paper to tell me I can read write and keep a rhythm 😂😂😂nor do I need one to tell me I can make two pieces one or to cook or clean or to work on my vehicles.... 😅😅😅if anything Google should be a subscribed service 😂😂😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Truth. I earned my medical license by performing Google searches and reading books at the library once a week. Who needs an education?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @JohnDoeCoastToCoast dont give em any ideas 🤣
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You know how hard i had to work to get where i am? Very fucking hard, now I get it times are tough but guess what I lived in a single bedroom with 3 roommates and we had to work to survive. Life is tough and can be a grind, your parent spent years struggling to give you the life you had while growing up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Iselas181 so what that should be the end goal? Scraping to get by? And guess what Sherlock things are worse now than it has been in YEARS. It’s now way more expensive for everything. My grandpa was a trash man and managed to buy a house in LA, and raise several kids and buy nice trucks. And whatever my grandma needed. All of that was off of his trash man job. It’s crazy he was able to be middle class with ONE JOB. You can’t even do that with THREE if you don’t make over 100k a year.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Iselas181  Lol no they didn’t… my parents, when I was born, had 3 children and a 4 bedroom house afforded from just my dad’s mediocre job. That would never be possible nowadays.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​​​@Iselas181 Yeah, but you didn't work hard to live in that single bedroom. You worked hard to get where you are now. None of us are ever gonna get there, so what's the point?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Tough shit you gonna go and make it worse?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Crazyhead432  ? To fix a problem, you first have to realize there is one, and then you can work on how to solve it. You're allowed to complain about problems. You can hate that your society wants to make you work your butt off and not even pay you a living wage for that. You can work on building a better society. What are you talking about, going to make things worse?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why not? If society has no benefit for an individual, why work to maintain it? Why not let it burn and see if new opportunities open up in post-fall stage?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So you want to live without internet and cellphones?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Tespri god yes is this even a question
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Tespri  if it means we get affordable housing, food, healthcare, and a good work-life balance then absolutely holy shit.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Tespri yes, actually. Take me back to the analogue days, if I had to pick I'd love to be born between 1950-55.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @palladium607 no y’all just actively try to make us look bad by ignoring any hard work we do and show all of the bad things we do and the things we don’t do… y’all actively try to make us look bad and it’s hurting our future…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@palladium607  u were too lazy to even type a sentence
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same here, went to University and made my degree. After that I didn't find a job (over 200 applications in the same industry all saying I need hands on experience first, well duh). Been unemployed for over 2 years now but I made my peace with it. If they don't want my workforce they shall not have it and instead pay my monthly bills. I live happily in my flat with my dog now with all the spare time in the world, so I can't complain.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Protip: lie on applications to jobs you'll be "overqualified" for. Just omit your degree.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is exactly what happened to me as a millenial but I worked at a deli.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Ken-Mojo-Dojo They never mention that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's become one of my favorite aphorisms, "you made your bed, now lay in it." 😂❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @carlygreen2293  "A lack of planning on your part doesn't constitute an emergency on mine" is my phrase of choice for these situations
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think the better way to think about it is, you do not work for free and the company gets what it pays for. If the company wants or needs you to pick up the slack then it needs to pay you to do so. Other thing I learned is just because I am capable of doing something does not mean I will do so. I will only perform slightly above what is expected for what I am being paid for. Work places no longer pay for people going above and beyond, in fact they punish it. Hard work is rewarded with more work until the person burns out.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Do I hear a fellow millennial there??  ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I once asked a coworker to put the tissues away because my bus only was available every 3 hours. Next morning I was yelled at because the tissues were still there. I told the boss that I asked the coworker to put them away, the coworker said I never said anything and also yelled at me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @meowmewsupreme i hope you yelled back at your coworker
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes this is exactly it, the payoff to working now is so low. I live in Sydney Australia a place that looks beautiful but is structurally broken. Recently the data showed you need an income of 293,000 per year to be able to afford the average dwelling.  Like, bruh, nothing about that makes me want to sell my soul to work if it will still take me 40+ years to own a home
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Dayman98  that home is probably gonna be underwater by the time we can afford it :,)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Dayman98  "like bruh" wtf is that.. and if u stop wishing for and buying crap you saw on tik tok and you dont need maybe you would have some income at the end of the month to save for a house.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a millennial in Sweden, have two bachelor degrees yet work with people who barely finished high school because it’s so hard to get a job in my field unless you have even higher degrees. I chose two bachelor’s because I wanted the specific combination of skills and knowledge they provided, but employers only want you to go the normal route with first a bachelor and then a master and then also require several years of experience in the exact job that they are advertising. My mum got a well paid job in the pharmaceutical industry when she was my age without any higher education. In the area I currently work they often want you to have some sort of higher education even though it’s a really simple job with crappy salaries.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Laura-mi3nv what type of degree / courses do you think would get someone into your field
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: EXACTLY.  Older millennial who has felt this way MY ENTIRE LIFE. tbh I am AuDHD,  so maybe that enabled me to look at stuff through my own lense from the beginning,  but... I am so glad others are waking up to this. Fight for your time,  your autonomy,  your dignity- YOUR LIFE.  They steal everything meaningful from us and give us nothing but subsistence in return, and not only is that NOT FAIR, it's freaking WRONG...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @entrylevelemployee  no, their families didn’t do anything wrong, the families are probably being abused by them
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Laura-mi3nv  most companies are going back to mandatory in office policies sadly. I'm happy for you though, sounds like you're at a great company. I think that's one of the keys is finding a company that doesnt micromanage and sees the value in their employees not being stressed out all the time. My last job was at a small company and it was a nightmare. I was doing the job of 2 or 3 people and had no time to even go to the dentist because I would fall behind if I missed any work. All of this while they weren't paying me enough to pay for rent in my area. I had to have several roommates. By the time they gave me a good raise I was burnt out and quit to get more education to try to go into something else.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Laura-mi3nv  Same here. 50. Was a self employed wedding/event photographer for 20+ years (8/10 stress 24 hours a day) and took a fortune 500 company job (no degree) 5 years ago and now I have perks (like free gym memberships and NOOM), PTO, $$$$, loads of benefits, work from home, not micro-managed, work 9:30-6, paid additional schooling, growth opportunities, stream videos/or audiobooks while working and couldn't be happier.😉
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ no she does not. It was a horrible workplace and she hasn’t worked there for many many years. It also doesn’t usually work that way over here unless you also have the required qualifications.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Saying I need school for the social skills I’ll develop is a bad take 😂 I developed all of that outside of school. In the real world.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: To be honest put it this, you cannot have money but you can choose for family, I would say fuck it I go family as working more doesnt really offer more.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im 27, not only is the system pointless but so many people i know my age dont have a social life and are really lonely. its rough out here man, thank god for cats and my two friends.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is very much what I'm fucking mad about. Why do the expect people to work LONGER AND IN GREATER QUALITIES OF HOURS than they will ever get to spend in whatever home they've been able to afford?   We get less and less time with the reasons to work for, then we work for them   Meaning, if I spend 60 hours working jobs, but I only see my partner for 3 to 4 hours out of the week for dates or us time, how the fuck is it worth it to work?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly why I am not taking the job I just interviewed for. If I took that job I would spent all my time at work and wouldn't be able to get certified to be a teacher...my ACTUAL degree
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Perfectly said. Emphatically agreeing!!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They also want 3-5 years of expereince for very simple roles within the companies to even consider you for the well paying jobs. Its all awful as a recent gradate looking for work who wasnt lucky enough to have time for internships... Im tired of these jobs not seeing my time and money used in getting my degree as experience, I feel I wasted my time and money at this point, because companies dont give a shit about education now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: LITERALLY THIS.  They think they own you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: These days i work so much, my only happines comes from paying my bills on time (it doesnt happen often)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: always take your sick time and make sure you poop at work and not at home. Save on TP and get paid to poop.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Laura-mi3nv What kind of job are you doing?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Laura-mi3nv Funny how you say all of this but won’t say what your job is. So what is it exactly?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 🚩🚩Because that is what Humankind has been doing for Centuries, and we seem to be the only Generations ( Z and Millenials ), that won't work unless we became Rich. ✨️✨️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How do you think this country was build?  Good luck in years to come, because you are going to be one unhappy and struggling person that will be asking yourself WHY?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: LoL, another (old? geriatric?) Millennial here, I gave up like 7 years ago. Career was my focus for 10 years (the only raises I got was when I switched jobs) until I realized that the level of performance I needed to maintain a certain level was too much; embraced mediocrity instead, I fear I might be fired soon, but a lot of people I regarded as better than me have been also fired, so I'm ok if it happens.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millenial here. I feel this so much.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes! I was rejected for a bonus because I "go to the bathroom a lot". They couldn't tell me how much was too much and told me there was no penalty for stopping to the bathroom, and yet I was rejected for it. Why would I fight for the perfect quality when perfect quality gets me as a name in a list in an email at best?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a 1998 Zillenial too! I worked myself nearly to death at a job I was passionate about, and then looked around and realized it got me nowhere. I've since had to retrain myself to work less hard, to take breaks more often, and call out when I'm burnt out. There's no point in working ourselves to death for these soulless companies!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's not just America. Labor market is f'd in Europe, too.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm Gen Z. I realized this after about half a year. I am basically two people if I need to be at work. So you can't tell me I'm not trying or anything. So now I'm vibing until I find a better opportunity. And guess what they hate that they are losing me! But still won't offer anything to keep me.... Lol   (Sucks to be them. I'm the only one who mopped. And the only one who cleaned most of the time.)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No raise at all over five years? That’s tragic. You should absolutely leave that company. You should at the very least be getting a cost of living adjustment. At my job we get annual merit increases that are usually 2-3% and your bigger jumps come when you get promoted. I consider this set up the bare minimum.   Someone else said you shouldn’t let this situation dampen your excitement. I get why it has, but I kind of agree with them, too. If you love your industry or specific role, I really hope you find a company that fuels your passion.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1992, and I had a very similar experience. Worked my entire ass off and got rave reviews from my bosses, but never got any raises or promotions (even when I put myself out there and asked for them), even after being in the same position for several years. I had to bounce between two more jobs and now I’m making better money but it’s so frustrating that the whole “work hard and you’ll be rewarded” is just plain a lie.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: change companies! I gave my first company my all and got a 7% pay  increase after five years. One day, the boss called me and told me he's giving me a bonus... of 300USD. Then, I immediately said I quit. He had no words lol. Now, I get double the base pay and 7% EVERY YEAR. I also do the minimum and don't care about standing out. Fuck that. I'm clocking out at 5. What worked for me is working for a bigger and richer company
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Lmao at least your job didn’t just decease and they didn’t straight up lie to ur face, while blaming u for lying
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Especially when you voice out issues that require solutions and no one is willing to do anything and higher management says "work with what you have" and consultants are getting paid huge amounts of money
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's not only the case for corporate America, if that's any consolation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yep also 1998 here and the place I worked just kept restructuring to keep us at a certain level even when we are hitting and exceeding the performance marks they set.   They don’t want to pay us enough to live, so they get subpar loyalty and work. You get what you pay for.   I’ll invest my extra energy in trying to get multiple revenue streams or doing something for myself, like it’s pointed out in this vid.   She hit the nail on the head sadly
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Little Miss don't let them take your "excitement" away. Get that motivation back for you-bc that IS who you are.There is a lot to be said for being able to pay bills timely. Don't let them suck the life out of you. Know your goals for today and this week and month. If they don't  match your boss's, talk it through and incorporate theirs with yours. Ask them "which do you prefer?" Makes it look like you are a team person they can depend on. It will be noticed. Do that every day bc that IS who you are. Work places change and shift. Your personal life-keep it tidy so that again you are in control. I'm talking about cleaning, wardrobe preparation and outside interest like group yoga, dance, who knows but do that for you. What you're going through is common for the work place. One more time, YOU be the best at your job. Have things done before the deadline date. Make it a game for you. They will notice. Keep your eyes open for new opportunities. Please let me know how you do. This is my strength.  And The Darkest Fateful- you have this. Write or know your work goal per month then by week at work. You don't need anyone for direction on that. Think of it kind of like one of those computer games. Work faster and smarter. Over and over again. It can actually be engaging and rewarding to you. Wrap up all loose ends on Fridays. Then Mondays are brand and in an odd way it is kind of fun. Please tell how it goes bc you do have this. Don't worry about the raise or promo yet. Get this down. YOU be the best.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @conniejohnson3029  are you being sincere?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​ @conniejohnson3029  ​ Bless your heart you really do seem to be sincere, but... Connie -- and I'm holding your hand when I say this -- its genuinely just not feasible anymore. You could have the best game plan in the world, the greatest routine, and it still wouldn't be enough to make a difference in how work sucks the life out of you. The game itself has changed, Connie, and we just can't play with the old pieces like that anymore hoping that they'll fall into place. And, -- I promise I'm not saying this to poke at you, just a thought that crossed my mind when I read your comment -- isn't it a little messed up to be reduced to telling people to treat their everyday suffering like a game? Like no amount of trying to mentally reframe the abuse you receive, whether it be from a partner, person, or job, is going to make the abuse and exploitation magically feel better and more acceptable, you know? After a while it just feels like you're being encouraged to gaslight and lie to yourself in an effort to retain your dignity.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @conniejohnson3029 I want whatever you’re smoking… Or, the coolaid you are drinking??? Jeeeez, I’m a middle millennial, you just made me want to work less hard with all that “motivational” nonsense lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My parents have said the same thing.   They'll let me live at their house as long as I'm earning and saving.  Same with my Grandma who I'm staying with, and she also likes the company, which helps if she has a fall.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sadly. Most people with higher position on most companies doesn't give a f*** about the ordinary employees. This one of my reason to just do the job but not really go above and beyond. They'll just exploit the hard work that the hard working bees do all the time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was in your situation. I quickly found out that interest rates make home loans impossibly worth a lot more. A small $60k townhouse is not going to be worth $190k or more within 30 years (use the interest calculator). Our only option is quite literally to rent unless we invest in crypto and make enough to buy a plot of land to develop on that will be worth something.. even if not that, just something that isn't funny money worthless dollars. I ended up moving to an apartment and my parents are helping in rent. It's my way of telling them "good job, this is what you have to do now until I croak"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same, my parents are letting me to stay until I have enough saved to get my own thing. Now, I had to be on the verge of kms for them to understand that I may be just struggling rather than being a lazy bum.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I saw my father go to into his office day in and day out for years. 1 hour commute one way, one hour back, maybe longer if traffic was particularly bad. He made a good living, but absolutely despised his job, despised his office, and absolutely despised his commute. He was depressed, miserable, and hated his own life, so that he could provide for me, my mother, and my brother.   He had a lot of goals and dreams, things he wanted to do after he finally retired, specially since he had saved up so much.  He died in a vehicle accident at 48 years old.  I have nothing but respect and appreciation for him providing for us, but I will never make those same decisions for my own life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think it's also important to talk about the death of entry level jobs. Companies are pushing back against remote and forcing RTO, citing collaboration and that it's harming Gen Z because they never learn work norms. And while there's some validity to this, companies are not actually investing in training and development. New hires are expected to hit the ground running and have years of experience. As a millennial I don't think I've ever had a good onboarding experience, and I get so many questions from gen Z employees that make me roll my eyes, but it's because none of this stuff was explained to them and they're never put in a position to learn.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If companies had their way they wouldn't pay at all.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There is no dangling carrot anymore. The generations before us could do the bare minimum and get a perfect middle class life. That middle class life doesn't even exist anymore
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I also feel like its important to note that many of us Gen Z-ers have seen out parents screwed over by their jobs many times. Especially the 2008 market crash and Covid
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Being told that we're lazy genuinely feels like a punch in a gut when you just went through a full time six months unpaid internship, got a job for a month and got let go bc the boss "can't afford to pay you minimum wage" basically had to beg for them to let me work there because I realized way too late that there is no job market for my degree. So I wasted four years and am considering working for any cleaning company and give up continuing education, cause that seems like the only peaceful way to get through this life at all. What does it matter if I clean or sit at an architectural studio if I'll get paid the same amount. At least I won't end myself from chronic stress
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "work hard or you'll be broke and homeles by the time your 60" morphed into "you'll be broke and homeless forever whether you work hard or not". I'd put in 110% effort if I had any chance of owning a house or retiring. That's not an option so I'm going to use my time more productively.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The stupid thing is, new hire is expected to have years of experience, while intern is not paid but do a full time worker's job. Let it sinks.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i’m gen z and i was recently over looked for a promotion because i “complain too much” i “complained” that we had no air conditioning and it was 85/90° daily and our uniform is long sleeves with long pants, we had no hot water and i couldn’t actually wash my hands and have them clean (i work in a lab where i am in contact with some pretty nasty stuff), and due to a staffing change i was so overworked that i didn’t have time for breaks. but i did the work. i helped others when possible. but apparently my disapproval of work conditions was ruining morale. instead they gave me a lateral move where i do more work but make the same money i am so done:)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Let’s just be honest: we’ve all been lied to for most of our live regarding jobs, education, and lives.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If working 9-5 could actually let me have an apartment by myself I wouldn't be complaining so much.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's kind of exhausting watching another generation get labeled and blamed for things that are systemic problems caused by greed that society just doesn't want to deal with.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a millennial and have the exact same problems as gen z… hard work is not rewarded anymore.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: edit for the people giving me advice: this was months ago, I have a new job that pays way better, my work-life balance is great, and my team is so much more appreciative of my contributions. don’t conform to the first big corporation you land a position with. yes networking is important, but there is a difference between networking and straight boot-licking for a promotion! go where you are valued!!  —    gen z here. I got a job right out of college and worked like crazy to stand out. I started training others less than 6 months in and exceeded all the metrics thrown my way while still producing high-quality work. when promotions came around, I was (of course) overlooked in favor of people who regularly came to me for help with their work. I asked for a reason why, and the only person who didn't give me a run-around answer said the others spent more time talking to leadership while in the office. so someone else was taking up my time asking me dumb questions because they were so busy sucking up to managers and partners that they didn't spend any time actually trying to work... and got rewarded for it! 😀 why work hard when hard work gets you no where?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As Gen Z I feel the anwser is pretty simple, I put in the exact amount off effort and respect as I am given. And if you as my employer repeatedly tell me my life and labor isn't worth bare minimum being able to clothe, feed, and tend to basic nessesities, then you get EXACTLY  what you paid for.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 25:53...you do realize that is a skit...right. It's important to me that people here understand that...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When I was 17-18, I worked in fast food. Clocked in early, clocked out late, went above and beyond, smiled, never complained, and made sure every customer interaction was a positive one.  I made around $10.00 an hour. No raise. No acknowledgement of my efforts. And to top it all off, they stopped scheduling me when I started my first semester of college. No warnings, no nothing. I just…suddenly didn’t have a job anymore.  Now I live by the phrase “this isn’t in my job description.” I’m not going to bend over backwards just so some CEO somewhere can get a new duvet for their California King size bed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When companys try to spend the least amount of money to make to biggest profit its smart busines, but when employes want to spend the least amount of time to make the biggest profit its suddenly lazy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My job recently fired six people from my team, were now down to 3 people working three different locations (mailroom). They decided to lump two peoples jobs on the three people remaining, and when I had the “audacity” to ask for a raise, it was rejected and they told me we could “discuss it” next year. I have college classes after work, I’m so unbelievably burnt out and I’m one missing pay check from being homeless. I’m 22, and by no means a lazy worker I just want to be paid a fair wage so I can LIVE, not SURVIVE.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Let’s please not forget that GenZ didn’t actually create these problems. They were created by older Gen’s and now we just have to live them, facing the consequences and the trash talk. We didn’t wake up expecting these things, the system was created and given to us, no fault to us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: RIP and I do hope you can pursue your dreams in memory of your dad 😢
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm so sorry for your loss. You had a wonderful dad who truly loved you and your family and was willing to sacrifice his own wishes and dreams for you. I'm sure he would be proud knowing he raised a smart child that live for their own happiness!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You had a good dad I am so sorry
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sadly statistically 1/3 will not make it to retirement age. Probably even higher percentage since the retirement age keeps getting extended. Sorry for your loss. Wish we could all spend more time with our loved ones because you never know when something could happen.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: rip<3 hope you can go chase your dreams
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My dad also never got to enjoy the money he worked hard for, I'm definitely not waiting until retirement to enjoy my life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In a similar situation except my dad was 57. Died of a brain tumor right when he was about to be of the age to do what he wanted and was passionate about. Oh, and he wasn't alive long enough after diagnosis to get any disability money after paying taxes his entire life. The rules are crazy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m so sorry for your loss 🙏🏻💞♥️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wow, that really does put things into perspective. Don’t wait it out so long in a spot your miserable in, because you might never see the “If I can reach it” your waiting it out for. I’m sorry for your loss. Your father was a wonderful man to sacrifice his passions for you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm sorry for your loss. May he rest in peace
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: He shouldn’t have had kids, if it took destroying himself to support them.   My “father” made the same mistake.  If we had never been born, everyone would be happier.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Hxjwipds269gd89  you need to hear this (saying with much love) - you being born was not YOUR decision; the probability that your parents choose to have a baby OR get peer-pressured to make a baby are same, but 0% percent of it was your mistake, and...lets be honest, your parents had tons of time to abort a child or NOT to make a child(they knew the risk and took it).  You could say that "father honestly made a mistake with baby making/he didnt know how to undo it/if he didnt only accidentally make a baby, he would be happier" with all the empathy you have. I understand it, but then your father would be destroyed in other ways by life/society, if making a baby was truly a "whoopsie" mistake for him.  Anyways, not your fault bro.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Every company wants you to have experience but no one wants to train. I can learn anything fairly quickly and have excelled at every job I've had - that I've been trained properly for. I feel like it's not hard!!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Don't forget all the "entry level" job postings out there that pay peanuts per hour but still have the audacity to put "preferred: masters degree" in the requirements and qualifications.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I wonder how many employers who are complaining about the poor work skills ever offered young people summer jobs?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My favorite part is when they expect you to have years of experience in software that is only available to enterprise customers. Hard for me to know how to use your issue tracking software when the only way to get experience with it is to work for a company that has it because the software provider does not license or otherwise allow access to the software for consumers. Entry level job requirements just feels like they're chock filled with these chicken-and-egg dilemmas where they want you to have experience with proprietary software or equipment that you can only have by being employed to begin with.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel so heard, omg. I've been applying for work nonstop since I moved to FL to be with my husband - I'd only ever had one job before that as a classroom aid at a private school (and even then only about 1.5 years experience). I learn fast on my feet and I'm quick to pick up on things because I've always been very attentive to details, not to mention that I'm the kind of person that hates giving it any less than 100% even on really bad personal days - but none of that matters because I can't learn shit if there's no one willing to teach me  "Entry level" --> "requires x years of experience" god i want to die every time i see this  ITS NOT ENTRY LEVEL THEN YOU [insert perfectly innocent and unnecessarily censored insults here] OPEN UP A DAMN DICTIONARY BECAUSE THAT WORD DOES NOT MEAN WHAT YOU SEEM TO THINK IT MEANS I SWEAR TO-
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m currently working in the school system and it’s also so stressful out here. I got hired while being very clear that I had no prior work experience in my field and I needed a low caseload (I provide therapy for kids) and what did they do? Give me 60+ kids with no training on how to develop lesson plans or anything apart from technical services that get changed (from what I’ve been told) every year. University definitely didn’t prepare me for this at all, either. It’s been taking a huge toll on my mental health.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @diana-qf5dw  they were in desperate need clearly. Sorry our system has thrown you into that situation. Neither you nor the children are valued.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: dont forget that for many the cost of reutning to office is not been compensated. Like in many places worker are not given parking spots and are expected to pay for it themself. and the cost can be more then what they make an hour.  Like just the gas price is more then what a company was offering in wage increase. so when peaple saw WFH they did not see freedom and all that (well they also did but they also saw). them getting 1-2  hour a day back from commute time (in car) where they could do nothing made no money lost money in gas and travel expenses. like I remmber reading about some WFH peaple that ran side gigs on the time they would be comuting to and from work and that was not a small amount of money they made.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was a trainee for my first office job in 2020 and 2021. I saw my boss and my coworkers maybe twice in real life everything else was over the phone. I have still no idea what I am doing and asking questions that are really embarrassing for someone almost five years in. My new boss finally realized that I am not stupid but just insecure because no one ever actually told me how to do my job and is taking a lot of time FINALLY actually training me. And what can I say: I love my job more everyday. And I swore to myself to do better if I ever have to train somone...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And then in the end people who lie or over exaggerate their work experience or education actually get rewarded for it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i'm gen z, this is something no one talks about. when you get into a new job, there's no training. for people who are just now working, how are they meant to know what's expected of them, if no one tells them?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I had such a bad crash out the other day because someone I applied to told me I didnt have the qualifications for the jobs over email, when the reality of it was, I ticked all the boxes BUT the "previous experience" box. I geniunely felt I had even a small chance to land an interview at most with them but its not enough to tick everything but previous experience. How in fucks name do I get previous experience when no one gives me that experience?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeahhh every job I’ve seen on the local job website says you gotta have food safe, cpr, AND 2 years of experience. I am on here to GET 2 years of experience, and staying at the same job for that long isn’t beneficial if it’s only minimum wage.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The only reason why i know how to do my current job is bc my last job left me to drown and learn the ropes myself. They do not train you at all.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: RTO is better for Gen Z in the sense that mentorship is much more difficult over emails and zoom. First job out of school especially would be a nightmare if it was strictly online.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ yes, but they aren’t getting that mentorship even if they are in the office. Pretty much anyone who was just entering the workforce in 2017 onward has pretty much been left to fend for themselves.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Most entry level jobs have either gone to immigrants or have been replaced by tech.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The company I am contracted for actually suggested to me (as a team lead) that we find volunteers to work an up to 15 hour day in the heat, rain, and cold last year.  Yeah… what we’re doing may be some people’s hobby, but it’s not an excuse to literally have slaves.  I was absolutely flabbergasted at that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If companies has their way they would have hiring kids like back in the day to work a dead ass 16hours shift just for them to die before they reach 20s.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Zero-sum games always breed narcissist power structures. Capitalism and government are fundamentally intertwined, it is a power structure that bars violent coercion by embedding it in a legal network. Communism is the same thing, except instead of many little companies, you have one big company that pretends to be a nation. If you mistreat people, then your company will rot from the inside out. Narcissists will climb the ranks and abuse the hell out of the system for their own personal gain.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: they would replace all with LLMs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah so they're like pdf files, they will go lower if you let them
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My recent thought is that life no longer has a carrot, too. It is more like a pile of sticks, like a trap with sharpened sticks you have to jump into
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: fr it's like on top of the personal experiences you have historical evidence of it happening to the people closest to you, it's a logical conclusion to not care about these big corporations, there's evidence to back it up
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: for real. My mom is running from doctor to doctor at 55 because her shoulders hurt awfully if she tries to raise her arms. She lifted over the recommended health limit for all her career stocking shelves up to this point, because employers see employees as money machines worth sacrificing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: my sis keeps getting fired after 3 years, for NO reason over one they make up...saving money...or her "too many pto hours used." i place LOVED HER, but bc $ they dropped her. another dropped her bc her employment got into a whole temp to hire drama. another dropped her bc the boss wanted their family to take her place. my dad has NO boundaries when it comes to work shifts, we had ti FIGHT FOR HIM to get days off and PTO used every time! the only one thriving rn is mama, bc she landed herself in a UNION food service job. and due to her years of experience, can take more time away from work. i want that, but there's nowhere for me to start...or nobody wants to take risks.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm more of a younger millennial than a zoomer, but one of my most formative memories that I didn't really realize was so formative until very recently, was seeing my family end up losing its entire amassed sum of modest wealth (two decent houses in an okay neighborhood) during the 2008 crash, because certain medical circumstances forced us to have to sell a house. But, because this was 2008, we were forced to sell both houses and still didn't really have enough to cover the medical expenses we needed to cover. I watched it happen right on front of me as a child, and I didn't really put together consciously what that meant for me, and how it would impact my outlook on life. I have chronic severe anxiety about housing security, and the years of precarity that came out of that whole disaster are, I'm absolutely certain, the direct cause of it. It's really hard to describe the silent trauma of seeing your family fall into poverty as a child, struggling to keep everyone alive while small every day luxuries start disappearing from your life, and the meals you eat start to come in the form of the cheapest carbs and proteins your mom can manage to find at the cheapest grocery store in town.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've watched my dad get stuck at a shitty job with barely any raises and a boss who scares away other companies that want him while he's destroying his body along the way. I have the same genetic diseases as him minus COPD. He lost a good majority of his body movement by the time he hit 45. He can't retire until he dies. I don't want to get stuck in that loop just to kill my body before I'm 50.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I remember that when I was a toddler and during the market crash my dad had a heart attack, and while he was in the hospital recovering he was fired because they didn't want to pay him a sick leave.  He went to the court and won the case but they still fucked him over it by doing that in the middle of the economic crisis.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sounds a bit familiar.  After 12 months of internship and passing national exams to get the paper proving I completed the basic 12-month work training program, the company didn't employ me because they couldn't afford to actually pay another person minimum wage.  Other places that used to say "Get the proof you have one year of working experience" were suddenly saying " Well, that doesn't mean anything. We need X years of work experience." which basically meant "We're not paying more people".
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel your pain, and I found it ironic we both studied architecture. I never even found an internship that wasn't a foreign trip I could not afford, let alone becoming an intern myself, but I ended up with 5 years worth of a student debt and my only work experience was entry level or manual jobs. I'm actively looking for apprenticeships and trainee/assistant positions, but I'll probably never agree to study for another degree.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Literally, and because internship is basically a full time unpaid job working is either impossible or you would spend all night working. In my case as a teacher we also had to do work outside of going to a school, so you would spend 8 hours in a classroom then spend 3-4 hours at home on school work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Some cleaning companies are pretty chill if you find thr right one
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i just dropped out of engineering to get a graphic design degree. i felt that last sentence hard (i wanted to be an architect)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @nkjsl791  can you still get back to engineering? Design degrees really don't pay off and architecture is among the most oversaturated fields. If you really want to do anything design-related, I'd recommend you treat it like a side hustle and not your main job.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Working a day job and night job six days a week getting paid and I’m still in the negative in my bank account. All I’ve done is pay bills and haven’t bought anything for myself in months. I live on my own with another roommate and there just isn’t enough money.  If the future relies on us I wouldn’t mind if our “rebellion” and “laziness” destroys the system that’s graped us this hard.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I did a 2 year paid internship with a promise for a full time position after graduation. I got let go and wasnt hired and I have been looking for A job anywhere. Im too educated for walmart but underexperienced for a "real" job.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THIS ! I'VE THE EXACT SAME! Also the unpaid 6 months internship, going through that right now. It's just exploitation really.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im going for my internship now in college and some of us r getting paid bare minimum and our working hours is the maximum we can work per day/week 😅 $4-5 per hour if I remembered correctly. Could work at McDonald's and still earn almost double that salary 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I relate sm because I also studied architecture, and now I'm working in a very different field (albeit in a big corporation) because the pay and benefits are just so much better than studio jobs. If I have to be honest, this new job is even easier/less brain-engaging than working in a studio 😂 Makes me question why on earth should we expend so much effort just to get paid so low when other easier jobs get paid better
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: my writing degree wont get me SHIT because of lazy asses wanting to use AI instead!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Good cleaners make good money. You could end up running your own business that way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Work and be poor or don't work and be poor
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: being homeless is amazing! The government assistance alone is worth more than a 9 to 5, I have medical and dental for free under the Oregon one health plan for all homeless. I get to go to ER for free and get free medicine as its like getting blood out of a stone trying to get a homeless nihist to work again.  unless they come to me and hand me a career with amazing benefits, prison will be my retirement plan.  either way, someone else has to work hard to pay for it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @romio7852  THIS! So glad! It ain't just me who noticed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @riomio7852 that's another issue. That and the vast amount of immigrants illegal and legal are both rather "political topics" but they are still issues regardless.   Gen z has such a wide partisan gap because of things like this. Out generations fighting itself over it. While the people enabling these issues keep fueling that fire. Or or deflecting everything else to it. Blaming everything on those groups. Only making it worse. It sucks but sadly it worked.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It literally is an option. You're just using that as an excuse to yourself. Previous generations didn't just graduate college and be able to afford a house. That isn't realistic, and hasn't been for many many years before you were even born. Your standard of living is far too high. You've gotten accustomed to a lifestyle that isn't realistic for your position in life. Looking at wages and house prices right now, you def could afford a house and retire. You just aren't willing to because you convinced yourself it's not possible.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @nicholasberends7751  interesting. Im sure you have a better grasp on PPP and inflation than all those over educated economists.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Companies wouldn't pay anyone anything if they had their way

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They don't have a place to even wash your hands in a LAB environment? 😭 OSHA would have a fit...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not being able to wash your hands properly is actually a huge risk in a lab, especially if you're in microbiology or making pharmaceutical products! What sort of country accepts that?!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ i really wanted to wash my hands with warm water after interacting with live e. coli! my company actually makes a product that goes into pharmaceuticals:) apparently the united states is totally fine with this lmao. luckily the water got sorted out within a about 2 weeks and in the lab we never touch product that goes to the customer, only samples which are properly discarded after. the air conditioning is still out though, it has been since at least may
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a fellow gen z I feel you with having more work for same pay 😢 I'm so sorry you're dealing with that it's just all shi**y right now unfortunately. You have my prayers 🙏 ❤️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In my job, they had construction work going on in the office. Everyone got exposed to cement dust due to them shaving down the walls. I got really ill, my throat shredded from the particles, could barely breathe or talk for a few days.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: my interviewer was mad bc i wanted to know the scheduling situation, and got meaner when i (accidently) asked for fridays off. basically podcast bro-ed his way into scaring me tf off, no wonder those coworkers look miserable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ job market is ass right now and i can’t find anything else:(
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ive had my share of these fascist goddamn jobs that expect you to have no concern for your own body. It's really gross.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Doesn’t sound like complaining. It sounds like you were bringing important problems to attention and trying to solve them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly. This is definitely not just a Gen Z issue (or millennial).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i don't dven think it waslies, things were genuinely like that back then...people with college degress were considered smart and respectable and got good jobs to pay for a good lifestyle for a family...the things just changed over the years but the old people still think things are the same as it wasvavk then and assume that we're just not doing enough
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @piya-tf  I agree. It used to be so different and few saw the changes happening til it was too late. From CEO salaries today to housing costs we all can see how we're in late stage capitalism.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Born in 2000, I was blessed to notice the signs in high school, worn  out substitute teachers who spent tens if not hundreds of thousands in education only to be barely surviving and looking miserable. Finally thanks to Shop and Co Op teachers i learned about the trades and so chose that avenue. Its not been easy, only way to get ahead was join a union and make plenty of sacrifices such as moving to a highly rural province, i may now in coming years build a small house for myself and my family
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yep! When boomers and Gen X, mainly the older ones born in the late 60s early 70s came into the workforce things were incredibly different. Hard work was rewarded and you couldn’t for a house, car, etc. now? That is all gone and there’s a discussion/debate to be had why it’s gone but this isn’t the 70’s, 80’s and even early 90’s anymore and their advice on working and work is beyond outdated
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I wholeheartedly agree. I believe that societies at large promote a narrative which motivates people to actively participate in them by making modern life seem worthwhile. That narrative consists of many claims—some are entirely false and some others might eventually turn out to be true but they're made with an unjustified amount of conviction or certainty.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m an Xennial.  I figured this out when I was 14…. 🤷🏻‍♀️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Even if you see through the lies you have no other options.  Unless of course being unhoused tickles your fancy..  Really your only two options.  Well. There is always... um, jumping your turn.  I.e unaliving yourself.. But that sucks,  I don't wanna not BE, I just WANT MY life to belong to ME...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen x here, we were told to not stay at a white collar job more than 5 years in order to avoid being stuck in lower pay positions doing more than you were hired for. Back then good union jobs were declining and the trade jobs (construction plumbing etc) were hard to get into.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yep. Read all three of John Taylor Gatto’s books. Older generations and government screwed the Gen Z generation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @L-89andgo13  Have read it. Learned a lot.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @aSuspiciousPete  speaking from the perspective of someone who lives in the US: we have been sold the "american dream" since we were young children. told that if we just "work hard and stay in school" that we'll get successful jobs, the white picket fence, and the nuclear family. now its damn near impossible to find a job even with a college education (at least one that can keep up with the cost of living), i can't even afford a 1 BEDROOM APARTMENT in my area despite making more than minimum wage, and everything costs too damn much to even start thinking about having kids (AKA just another financial responsibility)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @aSuspiciousPete didn’t teach us any of the relevant tech skills needed in the economy. Didn’t teach us about the job market. Didn’t teach us financial literacy.  But the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I work 12 hours every day and live on 20 square meters. I have to ask my brother if he can move in with me because I can’t afford a bigger apartment and a roommate is the only option I have where I don’t have to sleep in my kitchen
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @royharper2003 do you know how markets work? Demand and supply.  Do you think companies can just keep raising the prices and people will keep buying? And if you think that, why weren’t they doing it before rasinf wages?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ Yes, supply and demand has an impact on prices for goods and services.  However, I'm talking about the impact the arbitrarily raising wages has on prices.  If Walmart suddenly had to pay all employees $60 an hour, do you think their prices would go up or down?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @royharper2003 National minimum wage hasn't gone up in over a decade
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: depends on the 9-5 job you are doing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @royharper2003  Why should a full time job not pay a livable wage? In the 1980s most 9-5s actually meant you could support an entire family
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @royharper2003 No, no, no. If you're dedicating 40 hours or more a week to a job, it better damn well pay for the BARE minimum to live on your own. That's literally why a minimum wage was instated in the US. But now it isn't even a livable wage.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @royharper2003  If only 10% of the 9-5 jobs are providing enough for shelter.... there's gunna be a problem.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is exactly why gen z doesn’t put in that much effort bc when we do we get taken advantage of for being perceived as young and naive. When we work harder more work is pushed onto us as we are seen as being able to handle the already too much work load that we have, and when we can’t deliver we get reprimanded for not upholding a standard of work that we’re being underpaid for. I now only work the quality I’m paid as every time I’ve gone above and beyond I get slammed with more work and not more responsibility or promotion. And when I ultimately burn out I’m seen as weak or not a team player and not qualified. Even tho the work I’m delivering is overqualified for the role. We’re not dumb or naive, we’re over it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @aspenhancock1163  Its crazy how so many people have the exact same bad experiences dealing with Boomer bosses.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hard work isn't how you get ahead, nepotism and networking are. I've had bosses who made more than double than me cuz their dad owns the company. The hard worker is the useful sucker who'll do work others won't. Nothing about today values hard work. Working class are taught to work just to survive alone.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Or worse it’s rewarded with more labor that you don’t get paid more to do.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here. Earlier this year I asked my boss for an inflation compensation after almost 2 years in the company. Don't get me wrong - not a raise, a compensation for the massive inflation as my salary was worth 10% less than during my first week in the company. He refused and told me that I have to take more responsibility and be even more flexible with my work hours. Ah yeah, sure. I have to work more and be more flexible in exchange for this... pay cut? Ahhh. Okay. Yeah. Sure. Makes sense. I quit that job.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @MaynightMemory and that’s why I’m very glad I have a controlled contract… fought for by a union which already has an automatic inflation compensation and guarantees a raise every 3 years…   Obviously that has its own disadvantages… but not having to constantly fight your boss and against your colleagues is just so nice!   I don’t have to wonder if my colleagues earn more for unjust reasons, there is no sex based or race based discrimination… and if there is a problem you know where to go and they will fight for people like you.   This is something the us is lacking. People have been brainwashed to believe that everything even remotely good for the people is communism and therefore bad… people are discouraged from forming unions and community help… the only ones profiteering from it are the companies and the government who are robbing yall blind.   It’s so sad honestly…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well when was it ever?   If hard work was what makes you rich… some African miner would be the richest person in the world.    Hard work is NEVER rewarded correctly. It has never been and isn’t now…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here, I'm earning more than i have ever done and more than my parents have in there working lives yet cant afford anything, cant move out and cant afford to drive. Went for a higher paid position in my current workplace got told no as i don't apply my self enough and that i don't know the job enough to get it. I've asked numerous times to learn the job and been told no every time. Shortly after being told i didn't get the job my boss took on a temp worker and immediately started training them on the job i applied for then they wonder why i now no longer put my self out there and go above and beyond its a joke and i see why Gen z is like they are like seriously what's the point?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: and they keep asking more and more and still paying minimum wage for most jobs
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ve been working as a caregiver for the majority of the past 30 years and in my experience, hard work was never valued as much as it should have been. My dad taught me to work hard and I sometimes think it just led to my employers taking advantage of me and my hard working nature. My dad worked for a company for over 40yrs before the company was bought out by a larger company. He worked so hard but the new company treated him like he was disposable. They fired him on his birthday while he was going through cancer treatment, using pandemic downsizing as their excuse, but in reality they had found a way to get rid of all of the older employees from the company they had bought. He was never truly valued as much as he should have been at the original company but at the new company, he was treated like dirt. So sad.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m also a millennial. What I am surprised to realize is the amount of people who haven’t figured out yet that hard work for hard work’s sake was never rewarded. It’s a game. You have to have a strategy and play the game better than your competitors. Most industries give you all the answer for what they value, it’s then up to you to strategize and align yourself properly to get where you want to go.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The business you are working for isn't there to reward you by paying you, it's there to make your boss/shareholders richer YOU are a HUMAN RESOURCE and nothing more, and they resent paying you because it lowers their PROFIT MARGIN.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @drusilla3882  If you were running a business, that's how you would feel and what you would do as a result? Or you're just assuming and projecting?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not even effort is rewarded no more
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same. I threw out my back and was literally peeing myself. Nobody cares, “aww that sucks” , “man up” and people waiting for their turn to talk over me about their issues. Fun.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same. Millenial here and I already saw it coming...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly, companies want you to go above and beyond so they have to pay for another worker. For example I remember my step always answering his phone every time  it rang even on holidays. He didn't get paid extra for it he just did it. Imagine you blowing out your candles and all you hear is that ring tone followed by hello.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Hard work is not rewarding anymore" WELL SAID!!!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ Hard and intelligent work has always been rewarded other than in the most socialist and Marxist settings. With American schools catering to the lowest-common-denominator students, though, it will be a minority in society who have the opportunity to really work smart and hard. On top of that, good work ethic, good education, and the rewards for both begin at home, so the younger generations are struggling even more.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nor is truth and honesty. You have to lie (in a believable way) your way to get a job that pays an okay amount so you can atleast get through with your basic amenities. Putting in more efforts these days is useless unless you're already in a good position where your work will be noticed and rewarded.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It never was tbh. I learned that in HS when I was rejected credit, despite all A's and B's and once class planned to make up, because of attendence....I was gone a lot because I was CHRONICALLY ILL. I had doctor's notes, and despite them never following my 504, I had my entire family and multiple tutors outside of schooling tutors, and made it. And this was before I learned about my LPD or 6 learning disabilities...  I knew then and there it never mattered. Especially when they let everyone else work online as soon as covid hit, but me doing it due to illness was deemed "worthless".
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh your hard work is rewarded… to your boss and the company’s ceo
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ve found focusing more on personal growth than your job is the key
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen X here: Hard work hasn't been rewarded for decades.  Post-Boomer workers are seen as overhead and an expense to minimize in order to maximize value for shareholders.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: More like hard work makes higher up taking advantage of your hard working
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Because WE’RE not the issue. The systems are!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @RosetteAckesson  yes actually, that's why there used to be a thriving middle class
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don’t think it was ever rewarding. Ive watched my mom work in the same company since i was a child and she just now got her five dollar raise after being an executive assistant after 8 years.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Stop kidding yourselves. Hard work has never been promoted. I'm twice you're age, and it's always been the same, the rich get richer and the rest of us suffer! The difference between me and you people, you are a bunch of babies, and you want people to just give everything to you! You don't know what hard work is, you don't know what it really means to provide and try to survive! You all think by the age of 20 that you should have a house brand new cars and all the money that goes with that? All the stuff your parents have worked thirty, forty years for, and you expect it now! You say you only work as hard, as you are paid. If you ask me, you're probably getting paid too much! You are so entitled to what you think you're owed in this world and that you think you can show up to any job and that you should get paid a lot of money and have bosses and supervisors and everybody tell you what a good job you're doing every day, just because you went to work! The constant coddling, and reassuring your egos, has created this problem with your generation! The " I'm not going to work unless I'm paid what I think I'm worth" is nothing more than excuses made by lazy individuals!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im 40 and been feeling this since i been working at the age of 16. The system is a scam, dont work hard its not worth it, just do what you are told and thats it. You will not get higher pay if you work more you will get more work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeah, it effects everyone nowadays. my parents are struggling a lot. some of you just got a head start.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hard work also builds your skills and resilience, but agree that it often is free labor for employer. But as young person entering the market, you can build yourself and get paid for that by your current employer.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You don’t know what you don’t know.  Throwing school away when you don’t even understand what school is supposed to give you is not great.  I don’t hire people who can click the right button from a procedure.  I hire people who know how to find out the answer when they don’t know it.  How to think critically and problem solve and I hire outside the business major since that’s where I find the thinkers.  If I see someone willing to try and figure it out rather than just being told what to do, that’s the person I promote and I’m not seeing those people as often as I used to.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @tobytanktea  you're missing the point, even though you hire out of major a bet you don't pay a living wage.   You probably pay 65k and think that's a good high wage 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just have to say I’m a millennial born in 92 and some these gen z ppl have the most entitled attitude when you’re their supervisor*. Rude, condescending, & disrespectful yet expect top dollar AND a$$ kisses. It’s making me change fields because I despise having to hold my tongue and feeling like a dang babysitter to overgrown crybaby’s.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @alicekat11  Meanwhile gen z at my job are the best and most kindest as well as most hard working in my job. Meanwhile millennials and up are the WORST co workers ever. Rude, condescending, does the bare minimum yet expects everyone to kiss their butts and treat them as royalties just because they are older. That’s why I had to quit mine. Oh wow, it’s almost like your experience doesn’t equate to all gen z. Who would have guessed generalizing is bad and not factual. 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @alicekat11 92 millennial myself. You are right. They’re crying because they’re finding out for themselves what our generation tried to tell them but they didn’t listen to.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @alicekat11  born in 92 here as well and had the same experience when I started at a new job recently and our "training" was done by a Gen Z who was the most condescending person I've ever met. Spoke to me like I was an idiot, despite having  a decade of experience in the field. Left that job after a few months for other reasons but yea, didn't exactly give a good first encounter of a Gen Z colleague
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hard work isn't rewarded. It's expected.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hard work was never rewarded. High value is rewarded  Hard work with no value is not rewarded
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Foof0811 please I go above and beyond at my job all the time I ain’t seen not one raise and all I get is “ur the best cleaner we’ve ever had” and a fucking handshake like really but guess what the new ppl they hire get paid more than me and do way less work than I do ts got me fucked up
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Foof0811  found the born rich kid😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Tell that to a 16-year-old traditional Mennonite neighbor who earns about $40k a year part-time while still living at home and getting experience in different trades because he has mastered skills that are worth a lot to the journeymen he helps, and he's not the only one. So much depends on the ethics and real-world work that someone is raised with and is willing to do--or not.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ReflectedMiles  you do realize not everyone isn’t able to get the opportunities to learn those skills right
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's a painfully familiar story.  I spent years at a job I genuinely loved, working my butt off, to wind up training people who were getting promoted or given new positions and being sent to different offices. My "raises" were a  joke (as were all of our raises, at the entry level. And MOST of us were stuck there).  When I saw how people who were friends with the right people were the ones getting promoted (even if they started years after me, or were not nearly as well-versed in the job as I was) , I was working myself to the point of nervous breakdowns, it made me feel like I'd died inside.  I quit the job when I had an accident and realized I'd almost lost my life while wasting time at a job that seemed like the first rung on a career ladder, but which I realized (too late) was just a single rung that went nowhere.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Pushing 60, never do any more than what your peers are doing. What will happen is that they will want to KEEP  YOU IN THAT ROLE. I learned that many years ago.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @hummingbirdofgumption3263 honestly that’s fair advice.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hard work in your career is almost always misplaced effort. People who network and socialize will almost always beat the "hard worker" in the application AND promotion process. Companies pretend to be impartial and objective, but all companies are run by people, and people are social creatures who are biased toward people they like.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the cognitive dissonances collectively we have now is enough to break our minds. and yet we're supposed to stay sane and work our bones down for - NOTHING.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I found out i was being paid 4 dollars less per hour than a person i was training. I was doing tons of extra work and extra hours, im talking 6 days a week with 12 or even 16 hours per day. Then they didnt even give me the yearly inflation rate raise of 3% and when i asked for my pay to be increased they wasted my time for months before finally declining my raise.  I had a great work ethic. I worked hard. I was a model employee. Then work itself ruined that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No for real! These companies don’t care about how much you contribute, it’s about how much you butter them up 🤣 I worked for this one hotel for three years and trained everyone who came after me only for them to offer the supervisory position to two of the people I trained. And guess what, the newest supervisor of the two went on yearly maternity leave cuz she was pregnant every year- no shade to her, get all the babies you can get- It’s the management I hate on how they handled it. Since she was on leave and there were other problems with the night auditor, we were super short staffed and me being dumb- actually came in for almost all the times they called me in no matter how fucjed up my sleeping schedule became to the point I was getting sick. The only times I didn’t was when I physically couldn’t get out of bed. I finally got tired of it and quit. But when I left, what did I get? Nothing. Not even a thank you for all the effort and time I put in. Manager was relieved that I was leaving and the GM was irritated because now they have to look for another employee while they were already short staffed. Yeah, good luck finding another employee that is as stupid as I was. A month later, a coworker messaged me asking if I want to come back because they’ve been looking for a night auditor since she’s been on leave due to surgery. Nope. Not my problem anymore 🤣 Just wish I’d quit sooner.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And if you want a tip as someone who was an HR intern and is set to go into HR, managers usually don’t promote the best worker.   They want to keep the best worker where they are to keep things running smoothly on that level and promote someone who’s a better worker than most but not at the top. After all, they don’t want to lose their best workers on a more elevated position.  It’s really, really messed up. But that’s how they think.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, actually, with hard work u can achieve literally nothing, and I’ll prove it to anyone doubting me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They didn't want to lose (promote away) the person training those people.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why also won't promote the best workers because you do it all for free. That happened to my fiance he was the best cook and was doing manager duties, they wouldn't promote or give him a raise because why would they? They can get all that extra effort for less money. A lot of places will give it to people who aren't as good to hopefully get them working more.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's never been about what you know. However it has always been about who you know.   Networking with people is literally more important that the job you do.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Older millennial here and I agree with alot of the advice in these replies.  If you're outstanding at your current position, they wont promote you out of that position. Especially if you're already willing to do more than you're being paid for. The trick is to navigate a fine line of showing that you're capable of more, without doing more.  The way to get noticed isnt hard labor, its leveraging their perspective of you. Goodluck!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's why I hate the whole, "Employee of the month" bs. It doesn't make me any extra money, and I get nothing else for it. Not worth it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah it sucks because a lot of it ends up being favoritism. Be social with your boss and work hard when he’s in view but slow down once he’s not in view. It’s always about how they view you, the more interactions they have with you the more favor you gain from them. It sucks balls that this is the way to achieve any promotions.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In case it isn't too late, money doesn't come from admin work. It comes from work with a risk element.  If admin is your thing, you could join the government where there's no bottom line consideration. Or teaching, jobs like that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s always been like that for everyone
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Never go above and beyond for corporate
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You still want to work hard so you can get skills.    You just need to jump ship after you learn the skill and make 25 percent more.  Nobody said you gotta stay there.  Don't think about money when you start out but what you can learn.  Your time will come once you have spec that's so shiny it's blinding.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This was literally me for the third time this past week. Well, now their top sales person is job hunting and changing their work style.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sounds like military promotions to higher ranks
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s crazy that we’ve got people actually saying we’re bad workers but the millionaire who tried to restart life but broke and barely managed like a hundred grand and then couldn’t do anything with it before they called it off.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That was incredibly depressing to read, I can only imagine how it felt
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: you are doing the right thing. start applying for other jobs and doing interviews. use the experience at your current job to land your next job and negotiate a higher salary. you hard work is paying off.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And this is why you slog it out for a few years then start your own company
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Socialize with the managers. People skills directed at the old fogeys will get you everywhere. Learn the lesson and keep being awesome.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @miriamm2978   okay but not all people have the people skills tho. im painfully awkard and usually miss social cues, its so frustrating that being good at your job isnt the priority, its how much you can suck up to rich folks. sometimes i really question the sanity of society as a whole after seeing these ridiculous systems set up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's the way of the world. I was you 20 years ago and adjusted eventually. Took about 10+ years.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think what some of you  GenZs fail to realize is human nature exists. Y'all are a lil less social cuz y'all grew up with phones/more tech, etc..but you have to remember that human nature exists.   You're not gonna get promoted or hired solely on skills, hard work, etc. People actually have to like you...and that isn't limited to older generations, it's human nature. Unless you work in a highly technical environment where you're gonna be sitting in a basement by yourself anyway, your soft skills matter and it just is what it is. You can be mad or get better 🤷🏿‍♂️  It's not WHAT you know, it's WHO you know
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They worked hard... they worked hard developing a closer relationship to the ppl with power & who's decisions matter, you didn't, it's human nature so hopefully you learned.  If it wasn't obvious, what's the difference between the help you'd give a family or friend and the help you'd offer a stranger?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Okay so maybe go to the ppl you were helping and have them put you on to management. You aren’t better than the ones you helped. So go get help from them
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They pretend to pay us, we pretend to work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Damn right, don't blame you one bit 😊
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: AGREED 1000%!!!!! This is exactly how I feel. I act my wage.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am millenial and so proud of generation z!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a Gen Xer and while I've had employment, I've always had this mindset.  I'm not killing myself for pennies and barely making it.  💯🎯‼️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Our labor works in supply and demand too. They think they get to dictate our wages when if less than 1% of us stop working for less than a day, the country comes to a halt.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It why i constantly junp jobs, I have little to no loyalty to a company. They see you as disposable, adopt a mercenary mindset.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ Job hopping is not a good idea. No boss is gonna treat you perfectly and job hoppers are a red flag to good employers. I understand not committing your soul to a company but maintaining employment for a decent period of time and having a good reputation is extremely important to those building careers. Or you can enjoy being a drone your entire life
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly!!!  I'm proud of y'all!  I realized this over 30 years ago.  Ive suffered in silence, like I was that one person on earth with a terrible secret, but no one would listen.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here and I totally agree with you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When you're aware about the pay and work, you have to honour bare minimum.Then just quit and look for another job, which you like. Rather, screwing things for others and you have the right to call out people who disrespect you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As long as you're not leeching off your parents.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im a millennial, and my bf says the same thing. He always says "act your wage."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Respect is earned not given this id your generations exact issue
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@MarcelGomez-e3lWhy NOT believe they're right over their boss's opinions? 🤔
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Good for you. And they have to keep you because no one else wants the job. I went from job to job as a millenial and have absutely nothing, no assets, no good health. I hated working with Gen Z who lived at home, most were spoiled brats and rude. I don't even know why they were working fulltime when they didn't have bills to play. At work all they were doing was looking at clothes to buy and watch series. I can't blame them though for not wanting to work but they need to learn manners.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: On the one hand, I totally understand and agree to a point. But on the other hand, I remember when my mom was working 3 jobs to keep us housed and fed. Sometimes you have to do more because it's necessary, no matter how people treat you 🤷🏻‍♀️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @promisedjubileedaniels   so why do you want and accept that as a future for yourself? Are you living to work or working to live?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ These people have never had something to work for like a child. They haven’t found anything of purpose in their life so they just complain about working. They dont want to accept what’s necessary for a good future.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why is it that everyone who complains in Gen Z isn’t doing well? And the people that don’t complain are moving along. Maybe it’s a mindset thing because I’ve worked hard, I’ve been disrespected, I’ve been knocked down more times than I can count and yet I put 100% of my passion into what I love and my employer has promoted me twice for it. Y’all need a life and passion
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @superkawaii8315   cool, would you like a cookie? I didn't realize everyone had the same lifestyle and chances you had to be in the position you're in.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @HasanAbiOfficial Because the people that are doing well don't have a reason to complain about. Unfortunately not everybody can be as lucky as those people. It just is what it is
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @HasanAbiOfficial  I see you in a bunch of reply threads. What do you get out of arguing against people who wants a better life and a more functioning society?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @hatter5834 You don’t change it with victim mentality. People are free to complain but this is also a public space. Complaining is normal but you don’t want to give in by feeling like a victim to the system all the time. There are real inequalities in the world but they aren’t solved by saying “This generation is doomed and there’s nothing we can do”. People are upset about fundamentals of life. They are upset about working to survive, not having money for themselves and the pains of becoming an adult. Instead of changing the world, change yourself and adapt to the world.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @superkawaii8315  i didn't realize saying hey I need money to survive so I can keep being a healthy and happy functioning member of society was me complaining.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why is it that everyone who complains in Gen Z isn’t doing well? And the people that don’t complain are moving along.

Y’all need a life and passion
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @HasanAbiOfficial I’ll say this, I think you were lucky. A lot of people get that shitty treatment and work hard and still don’t get promoted. Plus, you realize that you’re saying you had to get knocked down and most likely disrespected to get where you are? Gen z is calling out that toxic work culture out. Not saying you shouldn’t work and do your tasks, but your bosses aren’t gods, why are they so special? They are only promoted because they have more skill/experience, which is used to train new employees and to ensure people understand what they need to do. They aren’t promoted so they can bully you into work/promotion. That’s the problem.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @HasanAbiOfficial Simple. It’s easy to say “everything is fine why are you complaining?” when you already have everything set out for you. If you’re not  Living paycheck to paycheck  Can afford a house/Rent every month Can find a job Don’t have student loans Then it’s easy to forget that everyone isn’t in the same situation as you. As for me, I’m lucky to only have about 5k$ in loans, but I live with my parents. If they told me to find a home after high school, I’d be fucked. I tried to find a job when I was 16 all the way up till 18 cause I wanted to start saving early. At 18 I finally got my first internship, then my first real job of being a custodian. Neither would’ve gotten me close to owning a home or rent
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am listening to this at work, and decided to look and see what she was wearing, went from “oh that sucks.” To “She’s killing me”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My first job was McDonald's. I worked from 04:00am-12:00pm. Most of the managers started to hate me because the regional supervisor would always talk to them about how good of a worker I was and how I deserved to get promoted. They went out of their way to punish me by giving me more work than a single person could handle so they had negative things to say about me. I would have to work the grill, stock sandwich boxes/wraps, stock the condiments, do lunch prep, make salads, make parfaits, roll burritos, and fill all of the tea urns. If anyone would try and help me out, they would get yelled at. One of the managers would even keep me past my shift for an hour or two.   When they raised the starting wage to $8, they started paying me as much as the people I was training.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SadBaggieBoi  you could have told corporate about that or just sued. Then the managers are in trouble for not doing their job properly :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I recently got a job at full time at 36 hours a week and now I’m barely even getting scheduled for 20 hours. I’ve worked my ass off too, doing the parts of the job nobody wants to do and my reward was them cutting my hours to the point I can’t even afford my bills while living with my parents. Why should I give a shit?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They did the same shit to me when I was part time and I TOLD them I could work after school
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The crazy thing is that if you were a boomer you'd have a house and a car after a couple years of doing that back then...on proportional wage for the time ofc.   So you're absolutely right to do the bare minimum now, there is literally 0 reason to work for corporations. We aren't bad workers, we just have more self respect than abused dogs like previous generations.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @dennisrkb  Thank you for ignoring the point of my comment completely and adding nothing to the conversation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My first was Wal-Mart, they didn't just not appreciate what I was bringing, they seemed to dislike it and punish it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This sort of attitude is exactly why y'all keep complaining about being unemployed lmfao.   Cus guess what, a lot of Gen Z are actually doing quite well. Ya know, the motivated Gen Z thats willing to "go above and beyond".   So at the end of the day you do you, but don't complain in 15 years why your peers are earning double your salary.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ It’s almost like I explicitly explained that I DID go “above and beyond” and got nothing for it. I stopped being scheduled for literally no reason and lost my job despite doing more than what was asked of me.  The standard shouldn’t be “do more than what you’re paid to do and MAYBE you’ll get ahead in life.” I shouldn’t be punished if I do exactly what I’m paid to do, and I shouldn’t have to be treated like garbage by my employers.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ikr! if they won't give benefits and pensions and shit, imma play neopets while on the clock!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, I get that too If it makes you feel better, every time I tell someone I'm working full time and going to school (like you), they look shocked and a little horrified, so just know that you're not the only one who thinks what you're doing is difficult  You're not bad at life or school, life is just hard 💕
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @gwendalynnwatkins1296  Very nice of you to write this. Being supportive while keeping it real is hard to balance and find the right words, but also motivates the most, as it's neither depressing nor does it come across like handing out participation trophies willy-nilly.   Also, it's more rewarding going through intense, challenging times during a young age when you're practically unstoppable once you've set your mind to something than having to look back one day without an answer to wondering what could have been. Personally, I don't have an issue with forgiving myself for failing if it happens, but I probably won't be able to forgive not having tried, at least.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @LpSC2online all jobs are like this. I’ve worked a handful of jobs in different industries. They all have this problem.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @gracefulsnake6399 One of the factors are those people in higher position. Telling the ordinary employees, "we'll give you all more workload, but don't expect an incentive or pay rise." This is also one of the reason that I'll do my job, or if i'm expected to work overtime, i just dont do it seriously. Bc i know they will just exploit the hard work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @LpSC2online  The job market is trash currently
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hope you get a new job. I imagine a mailroom job doesn't pay much and you can easily replace it with something that pays you for the appropriate amount of work

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Did that one guy legit just openly admit to age discrimination??? wild.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a member of Gen Z. I feel lost. My father got to grow up, go to college, get a degree in architecture and support himself and his family. Now even if I graduate from college and I get a job that's not gonna be enough. I look at my father's life and all I get is jealousy: he bought a house at 29, started a family at 35 and is now considering retirement. Meanwhile I get to live through "once in a lifetime shitty economic events" like they're a weekday. The hope is fading for me, and I'm not sure what I'm gonna do once I graduate here in a few months....
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just turned 59, the youngsters standing up for themselves is fantastic !
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ‘98 Gen Z here. I pray for my age-group. I’m working in a car factory and see a positive future. My union has been great to me. I feel rewarded for hard work; averaging 54-56 hours per week. No college degree. It’s disheartening to see my friends, who have achieved more than me academically, struggle. It’s ugly to see what the media paints my generation as, while they’re working just as hard, if not harder. The extremes are always what’s highlighted.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Genz member, I experienced this shifting of the goal post when my dad kept telling me: “Son, get a Bachelors and you’re set.” And then when I got it, he said: “Son, no job will seriously consider you without a Masters.” He told me any Masters degree will get my foot through the door. Thank God I used my brain not to listen to that nonsense. Yet I’m the stubborn one who doesn’t know how to listen. Dad’s not even an American Boomer, but he’s worked with enough of them to become like them. Smh.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Gen Z who’s struggled with all of this, I feel like it’s even scarier as someone who’s neurodivergent. I’m AuDHD and I have no idea what I’m doing most of the time. I’m tired, I’m confused , and I want to push myself harder but I feel like nobody actually cares enough about me or my disabilities or my generation to try and help us. I know we have issues but I’ve spent a lot of time with people my age, especially neurodivergent people, and none of us want to give up or do nothing, we’re just tired of being lied to and confused about everything. Idk tho that’s just me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a current graduate student and gen z, and I'd just like to say, I'm worried that much of what is being termed "laziness" in the workplace is burn out. I know that some people may scoff at that, but to put it into perspective: I've gone straight through school. I went straight from high school to undergrad to grad school. My field requires a master's, so I chose to go straight through. To afford school, I worked full time in college. I had between 3 and 6 jobs at any given time in undergrad, and worked between 40 to 60 hours depending on the semester. Much of that money went into school and basic living expenses, I wasn't able to build a savings with it. My mom went to college in the early 90s and was able to afford each semester by working as a part time waitress each summer. Anytime I talk to someone my parent's age or older, they often tell me how jealous they am that I'm in grad school because they miss the days of getting to "just be a student" and enjoy learning. I love learning, but no one seems to understand that college students are not "just students" anymore. So, when my generation graduates, gets what they think to be a good job, and start making real money, they are disappointed to find that they still cannot afford to live and that they cannot use this new job to leverage a work life balance. In our society, college is marketed as the time when you get to explore yourself, have freedom, and travel, but that's not the reality anymore.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hope Gen z completely dismantles the entire system.  I'm from Gen x and in so sick and tired of working my ass off to make one guy a millionaire.  We all need a much bigger piece of the pie. This generation has the power to band together and bring this horrible capitalistic system to its knees
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Big companies will ALWAYS blame us for the problems we face because if they don't do that we will all realize they are the real ones at fault and always have been.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I keep hearing people talk about a potential recession and im just like... "Uh... Were facing a looming DELRESSION. The recession is already here, are you blind?"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm Gen Z who feels like my future was completely stolen from me. I went to college and that entire experience was upended by a global pandemic. Then I graduate into the worst job market since basically 2007/2008 and can't get a job. That and these jobs don't factor in rent/cost of living so you're stuck no matter how hard you work. We're just tired. We just want to have hope and happiness, not slave away for nothing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Crazy how some of Gen Z being immature and "hard to work with" means no company will hire me, even though I put in all the effort, compliance, respect, and professionalism they'd want. Like, if discrimination based on race is illegal, why is it okay to have discrimination by AGE??
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: when my dad came to the UK 20 years ago, universities and most education was free but now it costs your time and your  emotion and crippling debt.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 1997, and I'm a person who has always valued education for the simply the sake of it, I ENJOY school, and I'm a naturally very intrinsically motivated person. But I will say these past 4 years have taken it out of me. I did everything right -- went to college, got a degree, got a fantastic internship in my (white collar) field right out of school, was hired on full time... and then a year later I was laid off in a mass layoff. I fought my way into a new job, just to be laid off in another mass layoff a year later. I WANTED to love my career, but my industry does not value me. Companies don't value people. Meanwhile I have people asking why I never want kids... how am I supposed to feel comfortable enough with my income to have kids if companies either A) layoff people every two years or B) grind their workers to the bone? All of this has me questioning my place in the world as an Employee. The climate situation is not getting better, the political situation is not getting better, and I'm fighting for my life to help big companies that don't care about me get richer and richer.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My 18 yr old son is anything but lazy or unmotivated. He works 2 full time jobs. One at a local bodyshop (he loves this job) and the other a loading dock job at a local furniture factory. Makes great money but still is unable to afford to get a place of his own. He feels so defeated at 18 its sad.  This economy is the problem.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1:48 I’m 33 and I just want a job that doesn’t feel like I’m wasting my life
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Um as a gen Z 🤓 I was taught that respect was earned not given. So I just started matching everyones energy. So basically if you want me to stop being lazy show more energy and actually care about your employees.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The term "pull yourself up from your bootstraps" is even about it being impossible. Think about if. If you're wearing a pair of boots, you cannot physically pull yourself up by the straps on them because you are literally standing in them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @DimaRakesah That is because the original use of the phrase was as an oxymoron. It used to be a joke.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You  can do it  just  that you  will  slip
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hell, we can't even afford the straps because they're 5 different prices and have to be purchased separately and break on the first use
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Pulling yourself up by your boot straps, when I was growing up, meant something impossible. These days, it means you somehow make it without any help.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Nonybusinessxxxxxx yeah, those shouldn’t cost enough to be a problem. Also god forbid we use our money in a way that brings some small amount of joy to us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's funny that's even a term used how it is nowadays since the origin of that comment is it was a sarcastic remark made by well of people and company owners to describe an impossible task when the people under them wanted better. It was initially a comment that made fun of those people saying essentially what would be the equivalent of sating something like oh ur working paycheck to paycheck and barely scraping by, well just be a millionaire and that won't happen.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The phrase “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” originated shortly before the turn of the 20th century. It’s attributed to a late-1800s physics schoolbook that contained the example question “Why can not a man lift himself by pulling up on his bootstraps?”  So when it became a colloquial phrase referring to socioeconomic advancement shortly thereafter, it was meant to be sarcastic, or to suggest that it was an impossible accomplishment.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also because its physically impossible and was originally used as commentary on being told to pretend you live in a meritocracy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Did you know that “pull yourself up from your bootstraps” was initially being like “oh yeah do something impossible”, like pulling yourself up by your bootstraps! Try it! You can’t! (Not saying this to like insult ya, I just think it’s interesting ((・x・))   )
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My job bought my boots for me. I would love to have a career that lets me afford all my wants, but I don't. I barely get the mortgage, insurance, and tax on my house paid. I don't get my hair done, my nails gone, my lashes done. My car is 15 years old. My house needs a new roof, new plumbing, and windows that I can't repair. And the difference between you and me is you won't work the jobs that buy you the Boots! So don't talk to me about how hard it is for you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You get what you keep repeating to you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @boratlion8613  Does that explain why the wages haven't seen any relevant increases?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: But you can afford Starbucks, nails, hair done? New clothes, restaurants, new tech including new phones, games etc etc??? You better have a 5 year old phone and do your own nails or you're lying
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Nonybusinessxxxxxx  You think everyone in genZ gets their nails and hair done??? Your view of us must come from TikToks, and of course the people who film those want to look good for the camera
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Nonybusinessxxxxxx  I'm a 27 year old woman, I never buy Starbucks, have not gotten my nails done since high school prom, haven't gotten so much as a haircut since last year, my iphone is from 2016, and basically all my clothes come from thrift stores, and I still can barely afford to eat. Do not generalize people please and thank you very much ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Nonybusinessxxxxxx  Damn, man... Better be building my own house and sewing my own clothes from plant matter I grew myself in the garden with exclusively rain water I captured with salvaged materials.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh god, this is what I wanted to do also. Guess I'll finish up my degree and become a barista
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ it's rough out there 😭😭 good luck!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @buzz4205  God thats too real. Ive only been accepted for interviews at places that dont care I have a degree, aka, the same places I would have been without it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: About to graduate with my bio degree this semester. Just gotta say life is looking bleak. Even if by some miracle I do get into med school, what's to say I could afford it? There's absolutely no money in research. Even if I somehow graduated from medical school, what's to say I'll be able to do a residency?  Just thinking about it makes me tired and want to give up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That’s why I dropped out of college what’s the point if college grads are getting the same said jobs and not what’s in there degree it’s fucking pointless.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh wow… maybe I shouldn’t get that same degree … I thought I’d be set with a job after
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @JocelynStone-l7x  What I’ve gathered is that science degrees are generally useless on their own.  They’re only useful if you plan to use them towards another academic goal like a masters/phd or if you want to go to med or pharmacy school.  You could always go into research or teaching but it doesn’t pay that well.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just graduated in comp sci, this shit sucks
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's only illegal not to hire old people, after all :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was told at my one job by HR in a document that age discrimination only applies to people 40+. I was the only employee under 40 there. I left shortly after.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Age discrimination is everywhere. People get it into their head that they have the right to make decisions on behalf of others for age reasons all the time. You are too young or you are too old for people to let you make your own decisions.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @elinope4745 I remember being 15 and being told "A fifteen year old cannot have stress"

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Aye. I'm a decade behind you, but seeing all the shite the youngsters are facing and seeing them refuse to just take it fills me with hope. We've bequeathed them a dumpster fire, but they're not letting themselves be burned up in it.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: :D omg, a union and good hours a week!? ooooh im wishing smth like that for us too!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 54-56 hours of work quite literally sounds like hell to me. I get maybe 4 hours each evening to actually do things (all chores, cooking, and actually enjoy my life) before I need to sleep, and I'm only at work 40 hours a week.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Elder milenial here. Im sorry you are next on the chopping block of relentless bullshit and trashing. Apparently there always must be a “them” to demonize and blame for absolutely everything. And the people demonizing (Boomers, mainly) cant look around and see that maybe capitalism is our COMMON enemy.   You’ll get through it. Your generation is strong as hell! But I send love. And I am glad you have found success!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The advice he gave was the advice he received himself, and it was perfectly valid back then. Having a good qualification is still a help in getting a job today, but it's no longer the guarantee of easy employment that it once was.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have a Masters. It's better than a bachrlors, just not much lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @alexsm3882  The benefit is that if you're in something like software engineering you get more opportunity to learn from experts, something that is less likely if you have a job. That plus you get to figure out what exactly you want to do. But i agree, it's just a bonus with the biggest value being you get more time to figure out things and as a consequence you are more qualified and one step closer to a PhD which is not a good idea if you plan on working in anything other than academia.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same shit. I was about to start taking university seriously after a time of not knowing what to do, and then I got told that the bachelors is useless and you need a masters at least.  Then I saw the university staff be as miserable and dissillusioned as me and I bounced. Not gonna waste my 20s for that garbage. They can chew on crayons for all I care. I went to a place that actually trains and values me for the job I do.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Accurate. I'm a millennial, and I worked part time and went to college full time and got grants to afford it.  My parents are boomers and got grants too...but while they were in school, they were able to work part time and afford apartments AND college. I with my job and the grants, I was able to just afford classes, textbooks, car things, and groceries. I had to live at home with my parents because there was no way I'd have been able to make rent.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also a gen z student in grad school. I’m so burnt out.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm Gen Z as well, can definitely confirm the whole game has changed. I grew up fairly poor - at least compared to my immediate peers. My parents were teen parents in the early 2000's, and absolutely clawed their way out of poverty by relying on my father's military service as a safety net. We were able to finally have our own home when I turned 18, and my parents have both been through college and grad school, having now paid off all their student debt and two nice cars - oh, and they were supporting two children that whole time on less than $100k/yr. Now that it's my turn - I am more degreed than my parents were at my age. I already have an associate's and am one semester away from a bachelor's. Both are honors science degrees - Neuroscience and Biochemistry, as opposed to my parent's degrees which fall under the humanities umbrella. I've been working part-time for nonprofits for the entire duration of my education with wages ranging from $10-$15/hr. I've been volunteering on and off since highschool. My resume is objectively more impressive than theirs was until they were in their mid-20's.   SO CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHY IM HAVING SO MUCH MORE TROUBLE FINDING A GODDAMN JOB - and throughout my entire experience at college/uni I've been overwhelmed, physically unable to relax, unable to set time aside for social events either with friends or family. And I'm someone who has proven, again and again, I WANT TO WORK.  And, even if I do find a job, am I going to be able to afford even a cheap apartment anywhere up to an hour outside of my hometown? Not likely. There is no such thing as a cheap apartment anymore. The cheapest meals that fit all food groups you can make are at least $10, provided you have enough money to capitalize on grocery deals when they come around. That's $30 or more a day if you're lucky. Grocery prices are out of control.  The "college experience" is a myth for the average student. And so is the American Dream. Millennials were fed lies, so we tried to learn from it. People need to stop blaming Gen Z for shifting their priorities to human connection and enjoying what they can get out of life - because the current state of corporate grind proved we cannot trust anyone to take care of the incoming generation of employees.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I went to college in the mid 90’s and had to work 3 jobs to survive. I don’t see how someone was able to pay for college AND living expenses on a PT job. My FT job paid $11/hr which wasn’t bad back then and then I worked overtime in a different department at night and worked in the lab at school for an additional 15hrs per week. It was awful, but it allowed me to graduate with no debt.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I dont think the majority of college students work full time  during the semester.  I agree with what youre saying, but sadly i think most of them went deeper into loan debt instead of working.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is the best take I’ve seen so far. I definitely agree our parents had it easier. But when you get started you don’t always get what you want. My first year being out on my own I agree it was hard to make living expenses work. But as I got experience, I learned how to have a work life balance with no change in pay. Some of what people are complaining about is dealing with the normal challenges of starting adulthood alone. When my parents left school they were pharmacists. But even they lived paycheck to paycheck back then when they started. Now they had it easier because their college promised work right out of school so they weren’t worried about eating to survive. BUT they didn’t get a great work-life balance right away. I only have that now as a 22yr because I sacrificed for 1-1.5yrs before I was really saving money. Now that I am saving, I can afford a great work-life balance. I think there are societal factors that make it hard. But I skipped college and made it work so I feel like this is a mindset thing as well.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: you are no different than your mother.   There are lots of us who did the same thing, and yeah, we were tired, but WE.... KEPT ... GOING!    PUSH THROUGH IT!

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen X laid out the blueprint, Gen Z is putting it to the test. Remember how the 90s had "slackers"? That's the entirety of Gen Z, and it's beautiful. They're fully embodying the archetype.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @MCGamerNik exactly! i’ve also been thinking that too. gen z doesn’t give a shit, but gen alpha REALLY doesn’t give a shit (in the best way). its actually so hopeful to see them do literally whatever tf they want. they don’t care about authority, they don’t care about order, or climbing the “ranks” of a job. normally, this would be a bad thing, but all things considered, i’m rooting for these little degenerates lol i love gen alpha and i think they’ll be the ones to finish pushing this chaotic system  over the edge.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well said and I’m proud that Gen Z are voicing their concerns and breaking the silence.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Demanding the wage of a ceo when you flip burguers is the problem, never improving to do more than fliping burguers is the problem, the real question is if your economic production can sustain your dream and if not you must change, the real problem is the socialist education of transference of personal responsibility, if everyone wants everything free then nobody is working to sustain this group.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "bigger slice of the pie" Its called starting your own business. The beauty of capitalism is you can have the entire goddamn pie if you want to, but "oh starting a business is so hard". Yeab guess what, your bosses went through the same hardship, which is why they are getting the big pie slices.  Having to explain the concept of private business ownership to a (presumably) full grown adult is embarrassing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @bowenfeng9750  it’s not about complaining or about it being hard. It’s because some people do not start off with enough money to have a business. You can’t start a business if all your money has to go to rent. Dope.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Right! "looming", where do you live? Everything has receded already my friend!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: First recession?  Im rolling in to my 4th.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a mill married to a xenial. We got married in 2020 and literally as we started a life together, rent went up x2 and jobs were hard to find. He couldn't find work in our town because everything responded saying he was overqualified. I've had an anxiety disorder all my life so at the time I was cleaning houses which only covered maybe a couple of bills. We literally had to move for both of us to get jobs, and it didn't pay much. After the work experience we moved again to work better paying jobs in the same field of work. Places started laying us off because of lack of work. Even made friends with our boss who was upset about having to let us go. I 100% agree with your last comment. Having experienced literally what boomers lecture everyone to do, and it backfiring because of corporate logistics, I'm fucking done buying into the "american dream" brainwash. You are expendable. You're just a number that can be flicked off the page when you're becoming a hindrance to the rich guy's profits. Corporations don't care if you can't pay your mortgage.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm in the exact same boat: the money I make at my part time job is gone as fast as I make it and every job listing demands years of experience for even entry-level positions. This country is a joke.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was a Xennial royally affected by that late 00s recession,.  The only difference between then and now was that there wasn't rampant inflation then so it was easier to budget and afford rent when I did obtain another job a year later.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yep all those years of being excluded from stuff as a teenager "ohh you'll have your chance when you're 21" I never got my chance. I never lived. Now I'm almost 26.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m Gen Y and I’m in the same boat as you. Except I have a Master’s degree. Even with my degree, they still want at least 2 years of experience. And in the job I am looking for now they also want a certificate. It’s a joke.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My Xillenial daughter born in ‘95 and had a great job in tech and her entire ten person team was let go except for her so she dodged a bullet but her and everyone else that works there, regardless of skills and experience and great reviews, are petrified they are going to be next, even though the company is making billions every quarter. Layoffs make Wall Street happy and the work culture there is destroyed.  (I’m doing what I can to support her and I am telling her when I see her on Thanksgiving that I will be fully funding her 2 year olds future university funding so she won’t have to worry about that if she does lose her job).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You even have the college experience? In Switzerland many unis don't even have as many parties as 8 years ago. Now if you party you struggle to keep up with exams anyway.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This! I am just tired I need a week of sleep and I can't afford to eat properly. I feel like doodoo all the time
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @stephaniec3022  I’m in the same boat as you. I’m a Gen Y and I got my Master’s degree in Public Health. I have a bit of experience but not enough to land a job.  I’m so done with the traditional work. I did get a job interview yesterday for a remote Health Coaching job that I am very excited about Please wish me good luck.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same. Add into this that any good paying job requires HIGHER DEGREES even when they are not needed, but still those jobs are also not getting paid nearly as much as they should.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The problem with your statement is that the situation you face is and was the norm for decades. The post war era of the boomers was an aberration ie the opportunities that your parents and grand patents  had was abnormal. Don’t expect the same. Plus another way society has reverted to the past is that getting a job now depends more on family connections than your academic chops, owning a house depends on the bank of Mum and Dad.  Plus retreating from society by not voting never helps - in the recent election Gen Z stayed away.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel the same way, couldnt even afford college despite being accepted to several.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So I’m gen z too and have spent the past 7 years getting off the street and clean from drugs and putting myself through school on full ride scholarships for accounting and it’s kinda just that, someone like me who is willing to put in real and honest work everyday has nothing but optimism for the future. I have good jobs already lined up for when I graduate and no student debt because of scholarships. If you went for a dumb degree, got mediocre grades, and took on debt to get this degree, yeah you’re fucked because you made very bad decisions pandemic or no like I said I was homeless addicted to drugs but am figuring it out and it’s not that bad.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm glad you've noticed that rent/mortgages are increasing! You're ahead of the pack. If you're like most people, you're going to blame your employer for not paying you enough. Even though housing prices are set BY HOME OWNERS!!! If you don't like the costs of rising rents, STOP PAYING THEM!! Buy a plot of land and an RV. Live off the grid! Get a StarLink! Just imagine what your budget would look like if you didn't have a rent/mortgage payment at the start of each month!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Hypercube9  If they struggle to pay for rent, they are not going to afford a plot of land and an RV when they need to also go to work (since that would require them to either sync their schedules perfectly to use that RV as transportation or get a 2nd car), not to mention that you are not buying a plot of land anywhere near a reasonably sized city and you are not getting a job outside a reasonably sized city. Your comment is delusional and the sign of someone who watched too many youtube videos. And before you reply, a big chunk of jobs cannot be done remotely, so no, they can't NOT commute to work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Hypercube9 land is just as expensive. Because that's also being price scalped and inflated like crazy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Hypercube9  sorry but people don’t always have that choice.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I recently became a qualified teacher and when I was applying for jobs I was being turned down despite being the only applicant in a desperate shortage subject. My fellow training graduate was hired at her first interview and was told they chose her because she's mature and a mother. I am genuinely happy for her, but I can't help but see the pattern.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It is illegal age based discrimination is a real thing problem is it’s only for old people and not us
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@removablechan8515  Some companies will discriminate against older people by calling them "Overqualified"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Whenever I work with Gen Z people they are some of the hardest and smartest people I have worked with. Only thing they are lacking is experience, but that can easily be fixed. If I were in a position to hire people I would have no problem doing so.  One thing I have noticed with a lot of Gen Zers, many do not have confidence in their skills or intelligence. One reason when I work with them and they start self doubting over that stuff I tell them, your just as smart and skilled as me, only thing that differs is experience and you will get that. I can solve these problems so quickly because I have been doing this so long and I have already encountered and solved this problem before. So don't worry when you have been doing this as long as I have, I am sure you will do things even faster and better.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @kurtfrederiksen5538  people working is how they get experience, lack of experience shouldn’t be considered a problem
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: oh, it is, but only at 40+ there are even laws for strictly that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same age.  Became an engineer.  Worked my ass off.  Company’s won’t pay you for your hard work.  Have literally been told that I have to wait to get paid more because I don’t have 20 years of experience whenever I became the best engineer on my team after 3 years.  I left made a lot more doing WAY less when I left.  Crazy why they can’t figure out why genz doesn’t have motivation.  I have little desire to keep the current system going 😊
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel you, also 1997, worked my ass off and went to an Ivy and did everything I was supposed to. Only to be treated like shit in the workplace, and I can’t lie, it’s extremely demoralizing.   And everything you mentioned, it’s very depressing and I’m not shocked that so many people our age are becoming apathetic and unmotivated. Hard work doesn’t really seem to guarantee anything these days.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Michelle-jc6gr My daughter did the same and works in tech. She is treated well but everyone that works there is petrified about being laid off even though the company is making billions every quarter. Wall Street likes it when they lay off workers to cut costs to increase share prices.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've been laid off before and interviewed for a job after where they frankly told me they would be closing and laying everyone off in another year.  That's how I learned to research the company and the job market before applying.  Of course, sometimes you just need a job, any job.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I once worked at a male dominated company and the GM randomly pointed at me, the only young woman present, to yell "WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY FOR YOU TO HAVE A BABY?" they were talking about the potential mandate of paternity leave, and he was not a fan. I didn't say anything, I was caught completely off guard, but that really stuck with me. Don't expect us to have kids if you go out of your way to be aggressively anti-child with your employees.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @DimaRakesah yeah, there are 🤡 like that unfortunately. Imagine the outcry after 15 years, 'why are people not having kids!?'. Some people can't be reasoned with. But I'm glad that he liked paying dividends to the shareholder...those are not para-sites....of course not!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 29 year old here 8+ years of expereince in a professional pest control licensed technician, 15 years of work experience in the workforce since i was 14. These past 5-10 years has been the worst and it is only getting worse. No jobs will hire, and if they do you will have 3 peoples job and they want to start you off at 7.25, it literally cost more to work than to not. I will be looking at different countries and hopefully the new country will accept a 29 yr old extremely healthy and able to work 15+hrs a day in the 100+ degree weather, just not in this country!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @09jokerking  Its sad how the "American dream" is to leave the US now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Born 1997 as well and husband 1993. I have a masters quit my PhD program bc I saw phds weren't getting hired and academia is even less likely to hire u and pay u a living wage. Currently can't find a job and am working 2 jobs bartending. Husband cyber security analyst 5 years of experience got laid off last year in December has probably applied to over 1000 jobs and interviewed 100s of times just to find out they went with someone internal most of the time. Things are seriously not going well out here for most people.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @smoothvibes7544  i have a friend who quit hers, too. And I'm not going for mine.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a millennial and I totally understand this. When I worked my first corporate job is when I learned the company you work for doesn’t care about you. My mentality shifted I work to get paid and my happiness comes from other things not what my job is. I don’t want to move up the corporate ladder I just want enough money to survive and retire. I’m basically restarting my career which feels like restarting adulthood. I was laid off for a little over a year and half. Had to move back in with my mom. Did a career change so my current position is a contract role so I can’t afford to move out at the moment. I’m 30 and feel like I’m worse off than when I was 25. Can’t even imagine having a kid.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @WhoSays12  Children do not appreciate being raised in poverty. And no, it is not a "necessity." There are plenty of people who should NOT have kids, like abusive parents, unready and incompetent parents, and people who cannot afford kids. Growing up poor permanently cripples a child's potential. Class mobility is not a thing anymore. Poor kids turn into poor adults, who are vulnerable and underserved. In the US poverty means no access to healthcare, insecure housing, and being subjected to abuse by toxic employers. You are thoughtless and inconsiderate.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is entirely my experience. According to all the older generations, I did everything "right" and now worry that I'll be homeless by Christmas anyways. I stayed in school, avoided drugs, worked for a few years before going to college and all I got for it is total unemployment as my internships fizzled out in the 2022/2023 mass layoffs and my Bachelor's degree now makes me "overqualified" to go back to being a gas station cashier, but also not qualified enough to get a software development job. I'm 27, have grinded away most of my 20s and all I've gotten for it is inescapable debt and the fear that I'll still be living with my mom when I'm 50.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If it isn't a layoff, they skip the layoff and just hire you as a temp contractor to begin with, so you work 6 months or a year and then you're on your ass in the gutter. It's slavery! But when those are the only jobs available you have no choice. I'm so tired.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The same thing happened to me. I was so passionate about my field when I started my career, but after being repeatedly told "You're the best worker we have" and repeatedly being laid off, I honestly don't care what I do anymore so long as I'm paid.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When a person's dream is to have a house of her own these days, It is a sign that things are really bad. Everyone is entitled to have a home and food on the table ss well.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jaimeerindy4573  i empathize. I've never worked in corporate on the level you have experienced. I don't even know what motivates the most to go a corporate route. If you're looking for challenges and good pay that requires intelligence and spacial awareness, you can be an electrician or HVAC. There are so many opportunities. How do you even know what will best suit you until you explore? There's more to life than corporate.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @TheAdamGiles  Well I work in the creative arts so not super interested in going to HVAC or electric 😅 but I do get that that was a risk I was taking on when I chose the field. But my point is that I actually DID get a job in my field with my degree that everyone said was useless, but those job opportunities have come to a grinding halt.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @TheAdamGiles  Hi yes I have tried many other trades they do not train anymore! Good luck everyone!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm so sorry - this will pass, truly. What field are you in, if you don't mind me asking?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: On the other hand I absolutely despised school. Elementary to high school, the material was downright brain killingly boring. I can't talk about college because I've never experienced it.  Then there's also all the bullying that went on at school. I'm so glad I'm out and far away from that shithole
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Literally THIS. 1997 here too, it’s such a betrayal to do everything “right” but still get screwed
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: atleast u studied and got somewhere i was enjoying school just about end of highschool. things went down hill after
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: LEARNING is fun. Working is not
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 1997 too, they won’t even give me a raise but work me to the bone then give a raise to their best friend lmao it’s sick
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s the failing economy that causes mass layoffs nowadays. That combined with the move to automatization is making many lose their job
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @K0HAKU_97  it actually isn't, there was a time when mass layoffs where indeed caused by the failing economy, but in today's world is mostly to cut costs and keep profit margins for investors. There's an episode from the "If books could kill" podcast titled "Who moved my cheese?" where they touch on this topic if you're interested
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @K0HAKU_97  It isn't a failing economy at all; the economy is not failing, the way employers work now is failing. Mass layoffs, lack of pensions, lack of reliability, can all be traced back to a couple of economists and one monster of a CEO. This is a design choice that has finally born fruit in the last 15 years ... and that fruit is poisonous to basically everyone but CEOs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @K0HAKU_97 the issue is it's happening to jobs that can't be automatic. It's everywhere.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i didnt do half of that and i get to be a stay at home boyfriend  with a spouse that makes a good amount of money and allows me to do whatever at 23😂😂

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: At least he has you. Please continue supporting him! He needs it! As a young adult I wish i had that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is all late stage capitalism.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why would he be looking for a place of his own at 18? So he can put all his spare income into some landlord's profits instead of his own savings? Keep him living rent free at home, and get him an appointment with a financial adviser who can teach him savings goals. If he doesn't move out until he's bought his own place, you won. If he doesn't move out until the mortgage is paid off and he owns his own place outright, bonus points.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Treat his jobs like hobbies and encourage him. He may not succeed financially by working but being unemployed will destroy him.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If he can't afford a place of his own, I think you need to redefine what "great money" means.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @thelordz33  have you seen flat prices. i dont think anyone want a space the size of a bathroom for 2000 a month. the guy has standards and needs basic necessities too🤓🤓
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s weird people are acting like getting your own place at 18 is stupid or unheard of. But I’m 25 and my entire life I was given the explicit impression that as soon as you turn 18 you need to start moving out and creating your own life. I have been told that by media, by teachers, by family, my entire life this has been an extremely common idea and somehow people in these comments have never bumped into this idea. That’s crazy to me, they must not have been paying attention to other people
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not tryna be mean but why is he doing 2 jobs at 18. He is young. Why u making him do 2?.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@nuhabashir1672how did you read that comment and assume someone was forcing him to work two jobs??
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ The subtext is that she doesn't have any money either.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: He works 10 hour days, 7 days a week?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Your governments have done this with the imposition of mass immigration which lowers wages makes jobs insecure and raises the price of property exponentially.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Guitar6ty more like did it through cuts to worker protections, prioritising corporate super-profits and failing to price control key life necessities.   But sure, it’s totally because of powerless immigrants taking jobs that wealthy companies are allowed to underpay them for.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Very hard to achieve. Not impossible, but almost. Id aim for something that pays enough. Something, where you can reduce work hours.  So that you can use the money to fuel what is actually meaningful to you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I work a full-time job at a factory while doing swing index options trading as a side gig, I know it’s risky but I don’t see many other prospects that are less risky and yield a better outcome than where I work right now
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When hard work is not rewarded, people will stop working hard.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm not even from the US, and I feel like I'm stuck in limbo. All my life I worked hard, got good grades, finished my uni degrees even at the cost of my mental health. There is no entry-level jobs. No one to give you a chance and actually invest in onboarding you. I WANT a job so bad, yet all I've gotten for over a year is "we regret to inform you" over and over and over again, and it's devastating. I even completely threw the towel on my pursued education and career path and applied for different other career training paths and apprenticeships, and even that is going nowhere. It's frustrating beyond words, and impossible to remain hopeful day to day. Either you get rejected from low-paying jobs because they're afraid you will demand more and argue with your degree, or they demand 5-10 years of experience with lots of other bonus qualifications and AI-filter anything that doesn't compare to that high standard immediately. Hearing politicians argue that "nobody wants to work anymore" over and over makes me want to scream.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The dollar has lost half of its value since 2000. Yet wages have increased by only 25%. That means someone making 20 dollars an hour in modern day is making the equivalent of 12.5 dollars an hour just 24 years ago! You think we're going to work hard for that? NO! Pay us more!  Update: Came back to adjust one thing in my own comment. Found out the wage increase number was done with inflation already factored in, so my numbers above are wrong. However, the premise still stands, and the wage increase numbers don't factor in that the upper fifty percent almost solely contributed to that averaged wage increase, and didn't factor in the increased costs of goods that mostly affect the lower fifty percent. That being housing, groceries, gas, etc.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen z, 21, 5 years work experience, never been fired. I worked 2 jobs at once in high school and was homeless. Shit is a fucking joke. They want you to die.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m moderately sucesssful by all of the traditional metrics. My wife and I both make good money, own a home, and are almost completely done paying off our student loans. It’s fucked up that we feel like we are the exception, not the rule. It feels like we have to work SO hard to make all of the traditional milestones that our parents reached with relative ease.   Continue to prioritize your work life balance. Don’t sacrifice yourself for someone else’s profit.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i wanna take a sec to say the tiktok shown at 25:56 is a joke, that creator was poking fun at someone else's video
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Sabotaging your future" implies there's a possibility for a future with material conditions as they currently stand. There isn't.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got an ad for a "google career certificate" while watching this. I want to work and I want to be happy with my work- but I am an artist. I am so scared for my future that I asked my mom if we could open me a savings account for a house in the future. I am 18
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We literally have the worst housing to income and rent to income ratios in modern history. What is the point of working if you can't even afford a basic essentials?   We used to live in a country where you could be a half braindead incompetent who failed out of HS yet could still buy a home and support a family on a single income. Nowadays, we have educated young professionals struggling to afford rent on a basic apartment (if not struggling to find a job).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen-z, homeless, and work 80 hours a week. Ive been working since high school, and finished my associates degree when i graduated high school with multiple certifications that pertain to IT and Networking. And it all means nothing. I set goals to have a decent future all of the way in elementary school, and i stuck to those goals. It got me nothing but burnt out. i went from ahead of all of my peers to further behind than all of them. It doesnt matter how hard you work, how smart you are, how polite and kind you are, how well liked you are, how disciplined you are, the system can just decide to toss you out for the hell of it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 25. I've been working since I was 19 and volunteered for my community since age 14. I've had over 11 jobs in my life, some of which required 40-72 hours in a week. Not kidding. I have a degree, loads of work experience and have always been told my work ethic is above and beyond. My landlord doubled my rent, for no reason, just because he could. My house was infested with rats and mould and I still couldn't afford to stay. I cannot afford a car, or to rent in even the most deprived area of my town. I still work, I want to be a wildlife rehabilitator, but I'll support anybody who wants to reject a broken system, one that makes you ill only to sell you the medicine and take more of your money.  I was told growing up that having children was selfish as the world is already over populated. Now, the UK government blames Gen z for not having kids, saying its selfish to not produce offspring to look after older generations. So which is it?  Gen Z are not lazy, we need change before our health fails and the world boils. Choose community over consumerism. I don't blame anybody who works just to survive. It's the only option for many.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They have seen gen Y,  who work hard and got nothing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They're mad that people are realizing what's important. Wealthy people always knew it, which is why they avoid working like a plague
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People want to work, they just don't want to work for what they're getting paid in an economy like this.  Businesses pretending it's not about the money when it's their sole motivation is the wildest double standard...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: something that is very scary to me as a gen z is that the goal posts keep moving, so we are told that we still need to do MORE or spend MORE even if we have already exceeded expectations. we don’t get enough credit for being adaptable. i see so many of peers still struggling after choosing a practical and safe career path. so, when we attempt to pivot to account for such, hiring managers tell us we cannot be successful and that we are “so indecisive”. for example, i want to move from marketing to accounting since i want to own something/be my own boss someday. marketing career paths are becoming fewer and farer between as more flock to join the field. but, when trying to switch with coursework, transferable experience/skills (albeit limited), and professional work history, i’m told i cannot possibly excel at accounting because i don’t have an accounting degree. never mind the 2 business administration degrees and same amount of accounting courses as an accounting major... it’s exhausting feeling like you cannot win.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 10:28 he’s right. Even in college they make you pay for required electives that have nothing to do with real life. They’re a waist of time, but without them you can’t graduate.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That statistic about the amount of people in their 20’s still living with their parents reminded me of the friends that I have who are living on their own but still receiving financial support for their living expenses from their parents to some degree. You have to wonder how much that factors into the number of young people living on their own.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a zillennial, my very worth as a person and how I was treated as a person was tied to how good my grades were. There was an extreme amount of pressure to perform academically. Of course I'd be resentful. When I became an adult, of course I checked out. I don't hate learning new things or working hard. I just got tired of my worth being tied to my output exclusively. There is so much more to life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 23:50 okay. I'm really going to sound like a gen Z here, but technically the original saying of pull yourself up by your own bootstraps was meant to be an impossible oxymoron
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z has been the fastest generation to realize the system is rigged.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: But it is rewarded. With more hard work
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s better to take higher risks when you’re young, options trading 😂😂😂  The leverage you get is beautiful but as a powerful tool it also has a dark side, learn well on how they work and you’ll have a better chance to make money
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: YES YOU GET IT god i feel so heard  I had to quit my job in MD to move in with my husband here in FL (he already had a home and like hell were we gonna sell that so I could keep a minimum-wage part-time job). It wasn't much, but it was work as a teacher's aid at a private school every week and it still paid something, I figured I'd at least be able to find something similar here  NOPE. I get rejected from entry-level jobs in ALL fields because I don't have work experience. Because that totally makes sense. Most frustrating shit on the damn planet - like, yes, I don't know anything, because NO ONE WANTS TO FUCKING TRAIN ANYONE AND THAT INCLUDES ME  I'm so done with the job market at this point. me and my husband survived on one income over the year since I moved in, but even then only just barely. suffice to say the savings account is pretty much gone at this point and any hopes we had about buying land and moving out into the wilderness to try and make something of ourselves in a more self-sustaining kind of way is all but gone. I'm so sick of this bs, I'm ready to put in the hours but I need some mf flexibility while I learn  (part of me thinks the only reason these entry-level, experience-required positions are getting filled at ALL is because the people who got bachelor and/or master's degrees but aren't getting hired for the work they actually want due to inexperience are desperate enough to apply for minimum wage entry-level work just so they can start making some kind of money, and companies are picking them instead of someone like me who has neither. but then I hear about these very same people not getting hired at all because employers know they'll move on ASAP to the job they actually want and don't want to invest in someone who's going to dip. So I don't even know what the fuck they want anymore and who the HELL they're hiring, because this just.... god it makes no sense)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You can always leave off credentials when you apply! It sucks, but it may help!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Finally some hard logic in the comment section
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They been delaying federal minimum wage of $15. It should be $23 now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SaulAguilar. this is the shit that gets me 😭💀. The powers at be fighting TOOTH and NAIL to not have to pay us a wage so measly it’s already a slap in the face. Meanwhile, it’s STILL not enough. Minimum wage should be raised or straight up redefined because wtf. Maybe UBI if they don’t want to make it possible to survive off “minimum wage”.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @SaulAguilar. I get paid $9.50 an hour at chuckecheese and we're constantly being told by the higher ups that our labor is too high and we need to cut hours. HOW? Accounting for inflation we get paid below the minimum wage people were getting in 2009.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Then you account for inflation, shrinkflation, and tax increases. We are much poorer
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Made 12 an hour. But even then they never actually gave me my proper hours even if I worked them. Particularly in drive time. (I worked. in the trades and had large drive times to the point of multi hour drives and got zero pay for it at all. Some pay you for that. Most at least pay you for the trip out. Or just pay you the moment you start work till you go home period. That's what they should do. I would make despite really working full weeks after taxes average 50-100 a week. That wasn't enough to eat lunch or breakfast every day. Thankfully I lived with my parents at that time. But Jesus Christ it was rough. While my case is pretty extreme that's how much they will go out of their way to not pay you proper)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ Got a buddy going through that in the welding industry. I keep telling him he needs to fight for a lien or something to cover expenses and mileage or the 20,000+ miles he puts on his truck every year is going to destroy him eventually.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was wondering how things are with the euro. The answer: we’re obviously being ripped off… I work for €1,800 (before taxes) [about €1500 after] for 40 hours…  Since 2000, the euro has lost about 41% of its value due to inflation, meaning it only buys around 59% of what it did back then. Specifically, €100 in 2000 would need to be €168.28 in 2024 to have the same purchasing power. This reflects a cumulative inflation rate of approximately 68.28% in the eurozone, averaging 2.19% annually. In contrast, wage growth has not kept up with this rate, meaning many people feel a financial squeeze similar to what you’re describing with the dollar in the U.S.  Regarding Austria’s minimum wage, it’s currently around €1,800 gross per month based on a 40-hour work week. Given the euro’s value decrease since 2000, for this wage to match purchasing power effectively, it would need to be closer to €3,000 per month to compensate for inflation and reflect an increase in living costs. This difference highlights the growing demand for wages that more accurately reflect inflation and cost-of-living adjustments across many sectors.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 12.5 bucks an hour in 2000 was pretty good. At that time minimum wage was $6.50/hr in my state.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Similar feeling. I grew up with parents who were poor and drug addicts (one died when I was young). Yet, I didn't see myself as a victim and instead worked hard my whole life. Skipped social events to study. Budgeted my money. Worked multiple jobs whenever I could. Went to the best university in my state in order to get in-state tuition and worked as an RA for room and board. I now make a six figure salary, but this is only after decades of under paid temp contract jobs, which means I've only now (in mid-30s) started saving for retirement. With student loan payments and $2k+ rent per month, and now paying for my Dad's home care because he has dementia, I'm still a lifetime away of ever owning my own dwelling. That's the crazy thing---I work so much harder, make all the "right" choices, and yet struggle as much as my parents who made $30k and were drug addicts.   I'd be better off never working hard, being stupid and low skilled, and having parents who I could inherit a house from. The truth is, the only way to get ahead in this economy, is to start ahead. There is no longer any sort of social ladder to be climbed through hard work. That's the truth of it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jennifermarie3158  "The only way to get ahead in this economy, is to start ahead" ...those words hit me like a tonne of bricks...It infuriates me that people will still argue against this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't know about "relative ease" but the minefield was certainly less dense. I graduated college in 1969 from the City University of New York. It was tuition free and I lived with my parents and commuted until I graduated so no student debt. I had a $300 1961 Mercury Comet that my dad gave me so no car loan. He replaced the Comet with a $150 Ford Fairlane. There were no charge cards so no charge card debt. There was no internet, cable TV or cell phones so these expenses just didn't exist. Air fares were regulated so no one but the rich could afford to fly so vacations were pretty much limited to where you could get to by car. With no internet there was no online shopping with all the potential pitfalls that come with that. Plus, every decent company provided good health insurance AND a real life pension.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm gen z (early 2000s) just graduated from college and can probably buy a home in the next year. Not a nice one. But a home.   It's insane that buying a house that WILL need work is the exception and requires a job that's considered pretty prestigious as well as having not needed student loans (thank God for being poor, smart, and having a sob story)  People my age should be able to afford a house they can live in without major work without needing to have literally every advantage they could.   And people with jobs that are considered very good should be able to afford a fairly nice, but still modest house
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How old are you? Are you from the gen Z?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @merlokiii  I’m 31, so Millennial.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why come here to brag to a bunch of faceless strangers? no one cares of your accomplishments, not even your "friends". I suppose it's an ego thing more than anything else.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @fliporflop7119  they weren't bragging. You're being defensive. They did not cause your situation, that is capitalism.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @fliporflop7119 brother. Talking about how being able to afford necessary items shouldn't be the exception isn't bragging.  Your "I'll never have to work a day in my life" comment comes off as quite the humble brag though.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Shhhhh that doesn't enforce the narrative
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It costs a lot to even work. You need a car, car insurance, nice clothes, well groomed. The bank of Mom and Dad isn't open for everybody. Many ppl nowadays reduce their bills instead of working.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ @ How would not working save money? Those are normal expenses for life in general. Reduce work for freedom, and then you have no money to be free with. You do like 20 hours a week and live on rice and beans?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ErinRSU If you think I came here to have someone agree with me you would be mistaken.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @hatter5834 The economy has been worse and has been better. It’s still plausible to have a middle class life with sacrifice. Sacrifice means the economy sucks, so you have to eat the same thing 2 days in a row. Eat rice and beans, don’t buy dinner out with friends… personal choices we make everyday influence this. It’s really not that expensive for the bare necessities unless you live in a really shitty area. People consider Starbucks and brand name clothes necessary. You need to adapt to the economy. It’s always going up and down. You have a point, our parents had it easier but we’re not in a depression. Getting a job you like and working is the best you can do for future generations. Employers aren’t fair because they follow what’s best for them based on the economy. If you had a business wouldnt you do what’s best for it?So if the economy sucks, employers are to be less fair and vice versa. We cant control that though because it’s their business. So adapt and give them a reason to keep you around
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @HasanAbiOfficial  You're ignoring the significant macroeconomic effects caused by employers all trying to pay as little as possible while working their employees as hard as possible. Every financial crisis in US history has been a crisis of overproduction. If workers cannot afford to live while working full time, they will stop working generally. No number of limp platitudes about hard work paying off will change those material conditions. The answer isn't optimism, it's collective action
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @HasanAbiOfficial you comment a lot everywhere lol. I think way more people sacrifice. Like way more than you think. People aren’t complaining because they can’t go for a manicure every week, but because they trouble even feeding themselves. I bet you think we could ALL afford a house if we jusy cut back on avocado toast and frappucinos from starbucks🙄anyway, did the boomer boss pick you yet?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The person that thinks they can and the person that thinks they can’t are both probably right. If you think there is no future for you then that’s how it’s gonna be! Half of this is a mindset thing. If you think you are a victim then you are. That’s the biggest issue with Gen Z. We have been taught to blame our problems on other people. When you take accountability for yourself you no longer feel like a victim
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @HasanAbiOfficial  I mean you've said a lot of genuinely wild BS in this comment section that I could write an entire article about how out if touch you are with the reality this generation experiences in regard to work.   You seem to think a positive attitude is the key to success and think your own success is indicative of everyone else's situation.   You are completely ignoring systemic issues and are not acknowledging that getting work under capitalism is a zero sum game, everyone cannot win no matter how positive their attitude is.  There are not enough jobs for everyone who wants them, there are not enough well paying jobs for everyone who is qualified for them.  People do not have a victim mentality, most people literally are victims of a system designed to be a zero sum game.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Housing shouldn’t be treated as a investment commodity but a basic human right
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @wolfbountygameryt1404 At the very least, the control of supply of housing built should not be determined by politics where there's such heavy conflict of interests at play.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "What is the point of working if you can't even afford a basic essentials?" -- so you think other working people should be required to pay your living costs even if you choose not to work? Previous generations worked because they HAD to. Gen Z sees working as a lifestyle choice. Yes, they are spoiled (and yes, I'm over-generalizing, but this is a youtube post, not a dissertation).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I relate to this sooo much! I remember going to college, then directly after working not one but two jobs! Busting my ass for a degree I don’t use and for all the bosses to say my work was just satisfactory. All I’ve got to show for it is a bad back and a people pleasing personality that I absolutely hate! Still broke and the only thing that I own is my car and it’s a POS 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am experiencing this situation right now. All planned out since 6th grade, held to it, and am currently in the process of collecting my degree. Also in IT, also collecting certs, but never feeling like I’m going forward. All the while everyone is passing me, even getting degrees before me when I used to be light years ahead. POS car too just like the other comment. It’s true, life is unfair and unpredictable, and I’m just hoping there’s a turn up ahead for us all. Cheers!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Ficara-d9q  good luck to us both, wishing you everything someday one way or another 🫡❤️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That’s terrifying I would think those degrees would get you a great spot ANYWHERE ??
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Are the certs in software? Coding is kinda stuffed with graduates, meanwhile the lower levels like systems maintenance, network engineering, and physical tasks (as in racking servers and pulling cable) remains chronically understaffed.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @woodsyturtle7080  rent is outrageous, decent paying jobs are hard to come by where I'm at, and I don't have a car so I'm limited on how far I live from where I work nor do I have the means to move somewhere more affordable or that has better paying work

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @yuungmung  I'm assuming this is a joke so: Lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Have you ever considered that maybe the fact that you average 6 months at a job is your problem?  11 jobs in 6 years just says you're going to quit right away and you're not worth the headache of hiring
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The irony is that if we had all worked together, we'd be in a much better place right now.  Morality is the most sustainable, efficient and profitable business ideal one could ever strive for. Imagine if we had actually processed our collective trauma and dealt with illnesses such as narcissism.  We'd be golden right about now, and our health would be so good that our lifespans made up for it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They dont. If they had the option, they would quit and not work. But..what is so wrong with that? Lets be real, no one actually wants to work. A very small percentage actually likes their jobs. Most hate, or dislike their job. The rest tolerates it. Instead, we want to DO meaningful things. But a job for 40+ hours a week to make someone else rich, just isnt meaningful.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: UBI $1000/m will cost $90B for current unemployment, while current healthcare spending on work-related stress amounts to $300B, not to mention the decrease in crimerate from everyone being able to afford rent. The early figures will increase to match the exhaustion, a resting period during which people crash on the couch from having been in a survival situation for decades, after which they realise that they can work a job they actually believe in. Investing in the people sees grand returns.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @prospektOS-tmo97  until they raise the rents again by exactly $1,000 to extract more money and we’re back to square one
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Who would have known that creating a society where the only thing that people care about is money, and the only drive for production is money, and you need money just to survive and have a place to live, that because of that all anyone cares about is money and that it's extremely important to be paid enough and have enough money to live but because the people currently in control of all the money want to keep it all for themselves there isn't any chance of new people getting enough money to do literally anything.  People aren't paid what their work is worth, businesses don't want to pay people what they are worth, the people in control of businesses are highly incentivized to scam as much money for themselves as possible while artificially raising the stock price by laying off thousands of workers and destroying a company for short term gains so they can get their golden parachute payout when the company goes out of business.   Whereas one CEO could cut his paycheck in half and cover the cost of all the people he laid off multiple times over, when it comes to choosing between the company and those peoples' livelihood or choosing to be slightly more impossibly richer, they always always every single time choose to keep the money for themselves.   Just look at Elon Musk, he moved Tesla's headquarters because his massive CEO salary was denied for being too large, the lawyers involved getting it denied got paid 2+ billion dollars, he moved the company and got the salary anyway, and subsequently started laying off thousands of people and cutting back on the company, when just a fraction of his salary could have covered the payroll for all of those people. Not to mention that he is the CEO of multiple companies so the idea that he has time to run all of these companies, campaign for Trump, potentially become a member of Trump's cabinet, raise multiple families, and do all the advertising he does while posting on Twitter more than anyone else... It's laughable to say that he deserves that salary. Actually ridiculous.   He just delegates all the work to other people, he is not fulfilling 30 billion worth of work for Twitter, Tesla, Space X, and his AI company and whatever other crap even if you combined them all together. And that is just one example..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Big surprise, narcissism and zero-sum games went hand in hand to create the world's most miserable suction cup.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Zillennial - The only reason I was able to move into an apartment at 25 was because I'd lived at home since college.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im a gen z ('06), being a junior in high school and im trying so hard to get out of this bad habit of my self worth being based on school grades. its hard but i remind myself every single day that my self worth is not and will never be based on my grades
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel this so hard. I became disabled in 2018 and when I was suddenly unable to reach metrics as my peers and it was as if all systems and people gave up on me and maked me as lazy and a failure. It has been devastating to my self esteem. Even more so in the pandemic when people were pushing for normalcy at the cost of the high risk people (most of them diabled) because that "didn't matter" as much. It's been a constant battle to remind myself that my existence makes me worth it, not my value to the economy or my job title or how many comendations and awards I have
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yea school kinda just made me have to go to therapy!! i am  very checked out and very done. i just wanna be treated like a person instead of a number

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Idk why it an oxymoron instead of a metaphor may u elaborate
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @OwlEmperor You can't do it because of gravity, you only get tired.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 2003, married to a 2002, both Gen Z, we both lost our jobs, and cannot get new jobs. We are constantly ghosted by fake jobs. I've heard calls that my Husband gets saying "sorry we are canceling your interview as the position has been filled." We are both very unhappy, and the worst part is that, even if we do get jobs, we'll still be unhappy. We won't be able to see each other anymore because we'll have to work different shifts because if we try for the same shifts, we will be denied even more jobs. We won't even earn enough money to live anyways, so what even is the point. I keep hearing bull about "the job economy is great" and "well, why don't you try all these resources to get a job?" I did, and I am now in a huge pool with thousands of other people waiting for a job. It has been 2 months since then, and almost 10 since I've had a job now. This country is a sh#tshow, and I'm tired of listening to the lies of how great it is here. I just want to leave and live in the forest... if that wasn't illegal.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Even the trades are rough. My husband was an electrician for 1.5 years. He was trying to get his license and to freelance after 5 years with the company. The company doesn't like people becoming certified (competition). The state changed the certification requirements from hours worked to hours of lead electrician experience. He was also fired 2mo short of his hour requirements being met. So, no hours, no lead experience. And fired for driving a truck driven through a dug up yard. He had no way to advance and only made $20hr
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why should younger people have to suffer just because we have? A better way is possible. It’s up to us older generations to make workplace changes that will benefit ALL of us. Thank you Gen Z for unionising against corporate greed, exploitation and abuse.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ve sent hundreds of applications and only gotten interviewed by three companies. For all three I did three interview stages each.  One job had a 2-3 hour long last interview and I got rejected. The second told me I was the perfect candidate, they felt optimistic, and they took me out to lunch. Rejected with an automated email. Still waiting on the third one.   Companies will waste your time even in the interview process only for there to be no return. It feels useless to even try.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as depressing as it is to hear about how bad our generation is struggling, i’m legitimately crying tears of relief because i thought it was just me. i’m 26 years old and in so much credit card debt. i have an incredibly hard time finding work. it is so exhausting to hear from my mother over and over again how i’m a failed adult because i can’t support myself financially. if it weren’t for the fact that my boyfriend got a job in STEM that pays decently, i wouldn’t even have a place to live. i’m so tired y’all. but i’m also really glad that it’s not 100% my own damn fault—because feeling that way is debilitating for one’s self esteem.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: unfortunately since I live with these people, it takes every bone in my body to not tell them to stfu when asking why I havent gotten a house. they then try to cope when I say it is impossible by showing me delapidated colonial homes with no foundations going for 200k on a half acre of land. I genuinely want to just not wake up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1:55 I don’t think we’re really rejecting education y’all, the universities in my country are full to the brim, and most of my classmates are women by the way, this feels really important to point out
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The problem with the school system is that it's working as intended. They teach you to sit in one place and follow instructions. That's the primary purpose of our public school system. It was designed with the express purpose of training the masses for factory work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a glutton for knowledge. I would stay in college and be a professional student if it was cost-effective
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 34:56 I tried to have my gen z child held back for totally valid reasons and they, the school, said I was being abusive. I should support her. I was supporting her. They pushed her forward every year and she’s still struggling in adulthood.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My personal experience is if you work hard you will be taken advantage of. I am someone who starts a new job very motivated doing everything thats asked of me to the best of my capabilities. At my last job I had another apprentice working the same job as me. He didn't do anything except listen to music and scroll through instagram all day while I did my work. I was constantly forced to work late, take on extra tasks and was criticized heavily when I didn't do it to perfection. He got to leave early every friday and flew under the radar. I ended up with a nervous breakdown cause my autistic brain cannot handle this type of pressure and I got canned. And this is not a one time experience. I have a disability, which makes burnout more likely for me, but I see a lot of people my age either completely overwork themselves or not giving two shits at work because if they did, they would burn out as well
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the answer is no we don’t. corporations have a greed problem
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I use to have an incredibly strong work ethic throughout school. I went above and beyond on everything I was given. I graduated high school with a 4.3 GPA and graduated college with a 3.86 GPA. I was bought fully into the idea that hard work and doing well in school will get rewarded. Three years later in the workforce, that illusion is completely shattered. It was shattered within my first year in the workforce.  My first job out of college refused to pay me more than $19 an hour, and gave me a 2% raise at the end of the year, after a year with 10% inflation. My next job was better, because they at least gave raises in line with inflation, but then a month ago I was fired with absolutely no warning, completely out of the blue, with no reason given. I later found out it was probably because they were downsizing the department (3 other people got fired that month, too, from my 30 person department), but didn't want to lay us off because they didn't want to pay severance. I am now back to looking and applying for jobs, but I have been so disillusioned with everything that it feels like no matter what job I get it will be an endless cycle of soulless jobs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The worst thing is that I wanted to be able to go to college at some point for theatre, and then it was revealed recently that I'm disabled... so... I just can't see myself working; not when I have to help my folks.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's almost like there's a structural disjunction, literally diametric opposition, between the incentives employers have--to maximize the amount of profit squeezed out per unit of employee labor time--and the incentives employees have to maximize the real value they're paid in compensation for each unit of their labor time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "They don't have any incentive to pull up their bootstraps when they don't have anywhere to go when their boots are on."   That shit hit me like a punch to the chest. It so eloquently summed it all up. Older generations yelling at us to "pull up our boot straps". Ok... AND GO WHERE?!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millenial here. We're on the same boat as Gen Z. Prices go up, salaries aren't going up, you're not promoted or paid appropriately for the hard work and/or the hours. It's not paying off anymore. Nothing more, nothing less

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same! Not married but no one will hire me. I had to even drop out of college not due to grades but being unable to pay for it. No one wants to hire us, and the ghost jobs suck.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sorry to hear about the struggles that you and your husband are going through. Have you ever considered working abroad?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: that sounds like something that would fall under wrongful termination. Even in a "fire at will" state you cant truly remove someone from a position for any reason. I'd ask a lawyer if they think you have a case
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Forgive me for sounding ignorant. But shouldn't anybody hired as an electrician be certified as an electrician in the first place?  At least that's the case in Switzerland. No certificate that you've learned a job, you don't get to apply for that job.  There's always some under-the-hand-fuckery in shadier jobs but usually you gotta have a certificate.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Aurirang heres a question, how can you learn a trade without doing it? In the US we value experience you gain as an apprentice over schooling on the trade. People who go to school for the trade end up wasting their money since they do not have the necessary experience to get a license in the first place. You need 4 years of work experience and pass a test to be a licensed electrician.  Any simulated experience you get in a school will be wildly different than what you come across in the field anyway.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: He should go in the electrical workers union.  I live in Boston and a licensed journeyman electrician makes around 150k plus here.   The union ensures you get the hours and training.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am so sorry but I hope you’re husband knows he is a hard worker and he would’ve been successful, the world is just messed up
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ouf 20 bucks a hour for electrician ? i build mountain bike trails for a living and make more than that ! Oof thats terrible.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ electricians where I live get over 100$.  The op said her husband was an electrician for 1.5 years.  If you aren’t licensed you aren’t an electrician.  It takes 4 years of on the job hours and 4 years of schooling to be able to take the test.   He was an apprentice not an electrician.  Sounds like he worked for a small scab company.  I live in Boston and the union electricians here make 120-150 a year

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @clairbear1234  The point of this video is to make a lasting change that will benefit all of us, and the first step to getting that done is rooting out these hostile inaccuracies regarding Gen Z's motivations to remain unemployed in the face of corporate greed, zero-sum games and the lack of governmental support for basic necessities.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im 24, dropped out of a good university after 1st year, doing B.A arts, i blame myself. thinking if only i could study something i dont like, something like buisiness or science of some sort i'd have a stable decent job maybe. but i dont like any of those majors! also i was working and commuting for 5 hours daily just cuz i couldnt even afford dorm. so i burnt out. im living with my parents in a city where not even 100% of your minimum wage income cant cover rent. my mom also keeps asking what i will do with my life. do you know? cuz i dont.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Good on you to not rack up student debt without a goal. I was a hard sciences professor at a university for a few years and saw way too many young adults without a goal racking up debt who ended up in jobs not needing a degree or later getting an associates in a specific area.   It's hard to know yourself.  Think about what you loved as a kid and see if there's something you can do related to that.  Best of luck!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im 29. when i quit my job in 2021 i was unable to find a job for 2 years. i genuinely tried. i dont have a criminal record. my savings reduced in those 2 years. all progress lost because theres no jobs out there
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @XJ9sodypop why are you quitting your job before finding a new one… you set yourself up for hardship
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m with you, original commenter. I WAS financially independent for a few years. Sure, it was a little tenuous but I’d started to even build a savings… Then I suddenly needed brain surgery or I would lose my eyesight.  Insurance may have covered the cost of the surgery and hospital, but it did NOT cover living while I recovered from the damage already done, adjusted to my new chronic condition, or even help me keep a job I physically was unable to work for longer than FMLA.  And my mom blamed me for not having enough savings to stay afloat in this sudden, massive shift in my life/abilities. Told me I should be financially independent at 24 and 2.5 years out of college. Completely ignoring that I had been just months ago…  That kind of shame hurts and sticks with you, but disentangle it from your identity. Your mother’s words don’t define you. You’re putting in the work. Just because she doesn’t see or understand your struggle doesn’t mean it isn’t real.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: you're definitely not alone, random internet stranger! I know 1 person within my age group and below who has a car and mortgage. A single person. She has a VERY good job and I'm very proud of her. But having money and savings and property is not the norm for us anymore. And it's honestly depressing how little empathy we are given from those older and more successful than us. No wonder we are all stressed, like look around!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Don't let people shame you for credit card debt. Of course it's not the best, but we all know that  bills, food, doctor appointments, women's healthcare like tampons or pads, household items, gas for the car, taxes, etc cost money. Do y'all forget how much you pay for life? There are also unexpected things like car breakdowns, a funeral to pay for, money maybe kids need for school, a pets expensive trip to the vet, a broken appliance to repair randomly, etc. Idk why people assume the credit card debt is all iPhones and lash extensions. To the OP,  i'm sure you're frustrated enough with the situation, don't let other people make you feel worse. if you're surviving, you don't owe anyone an explanation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Costco is notoriously hard to get into
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It'the same all over the world. People just can't afford anything anymore. Especially housing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What job does your bf have? 'Cause I got a bachelor degree in STEM (biochemistry) and where I live, it's completely useless. Entry level jobs require 2-3 years of experience and internships do NOT count as experience. The pay is way too low, it's a dollar or two above minimum wage. I hated every minute of college but I was told - no, brainwashed into thinking- at a very young age that I could never make it in life without a degree in STEM. Look where my studies have taken me. Absolutely nowhere. What a huge waste of my time and energy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't like that it's been difficult recently for you. I'm not in debt, but work is so incredibly hard to find these days with how many hoops recruiters and big companies want us to jump through to fill a spot that they (allegedly desperately) need filled. I always feel like it was a mistake to go into a creative field because I could so easily fall into debt when my parents, eventually, are no longer with me. It will be hard but you have no choice to push through. Try to savor things you learn and enjoy along the way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have a cousin (gen z, close friend of mine) who applied for literally hundreds of jobs to try and get more than minimum wage and it took a long fricken time to get any hits. Like, 10+ months iirc - this was a couple years ago. She eventually got a slightly higher paying job in a mall that was terrible and quit after like a year and started doing other things, we don't talk super often so I'm not 100% sure what she's doing now but I know she worked at a national park a few states away (they provided housing) and a zoo (low pay but her BF has a job too). She's also in college.   But yeah, point is, it took hundreds of applications to get anything above minimum wage, and you can't live off double that. And this was in a big city. It's ridiculous. You're absolutely not alone here, no matter what anyone says. We shouldn't have to fight this hard for basic financial stability.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ what’s you guys minimum wage? In my city it’s $17/hr. I’m not sure if it’s the same everywhere else.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: agreed, the bt about fault is a massive blow to one's self steem
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Don't feel bad. Us Millennials are in the same boat--struggling as hard as we can and not getting very far. 😢
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I do feel for this generation. Kids do not have it easy they’ve got so much going against them
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Uhh hate to break it to you but it sounds like your mom is the bigger problem affecting your self esteem. Yeah the economy is part of it but the person who’s supposed hype you up is literally calling you a failure??
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This! I am disabled/neurodivergent and I felt like such a failure. But it's kind of comforting to know that even if I was a "perfect" person, I would still be struggling. Everyone is.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i've never related more. I have a job but i have to do so much for the bare minimum wage, its just not worth all the chronic stress and burnout its causing me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bro, don’t worry, it’s not your fault. My mom’s literally going through the same thing and she’s 60. I’m about to have a similar struggle with my store closing and I’m 30. Never let anyone make you feel like a failure because you’re not.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not your fault! The only people to blame are the rich, since they built the system this way
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Can you see yourself married to your boyfriend and being a stay at home mom? Lots of people are deciding that they'd rather find ways to get by outside the mainstream economy. Working under the table, growing their own food, getting creative, and thinking outside the box.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Now imagine this but you don’t have a significant other to live with. This is the reality of many men
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ as well as many women. I know more men that get taken care of by women than I do the other way around. It’s crazy out here. Don’t let online fool you. Yall acting get help just as much by family as the girls do.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Life is a zero sum game. I dont like this ugly truth any more than you do. But I preach the ugly truth so as to bring you back to reality.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Failure to acknowledge that this is the nature of reality, is how the hubris of man will be the destruction of civilization. Are you going to be responsible, or an emotional, projecting, hateful tyrant? This is a rhetorical question you should all ask yourselves every day. Scoff at it, I did too, but my life has improved and my inner peace has returned, ever since I realized this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I mean how did you get the credit card debt? What did you buy?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You, and everyone else, at a base level, spawn in with a "have your cake and eat it too" mentality. It sucks we spawn in like this, so it must be unlearned. Otherwise you fail to make sacrifices and you collapse.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Life is all about sacrifices, give and take, the ebb and flow. Time, money, energy, fun, health, emotion energy, put some one place, and some will be taken from where you removed it. If your world is hell, you probably hate your world into annihilation. If your world is heaven, you probably love it alot.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Credit card debt? that's def 100% your own damn fault lmao. You can find work. Easily. I could go get hired somewhere TODAY if I felt like it. Stop being picky
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: thank your boyfriend for doing all the heavy lifting. Or, in the future, ditch him once he stops being useful for you. User.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah your credit card debt is your fault though
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What phone do you have and do you have a car? I'm always baffled at how Americans have so much credit card debt but then I see what they buy and it makes sense
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Florian00 cars are a necessity in like 90% of America, no car no transportation, can't walk anywhere, no infrastructure to do so and even then for most it's an unreasonable amount of time to walk to and from places(or over 2-3 hours one way) I can tell you if most people could go without vehicles and just walk/bus themselves everywhere a lot would but that's not a reality for us
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @AAKing-d8b  oh so it’s my fault that i have a debilitating chronic (genetic) illness that keeps me from being able to walk some days? cool, thanks man. really appreciate it. 🤙🏻
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hmmm your boyfriend had no problem finding a “decent” paying job, seems like you got yourself into these issues.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @TheGoodMMADog  Yeah she also got a ton of credit card debt. That’s usually due to one’s poor decisions.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's not hard to find work. Are you being picky about the jobs you're applying for?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@deamorebeaute2412  it is hard finding work. I luckily have a job rn but am looking elsewhere and it has been hard. I have a college degree and cant get an interview at costco.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @deamorebeaute2412  it is hard to find work, I have a masters degree and it’s rare to hear back/interview for jobs that just require a high school diploma let alone the jobs that matched my education/skills
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @deamorebeaute2412  Employers don't hire anyone, doesn't matter what you apply for
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This whole video is about the US for most of Europe nearly none of it reflects the reality of the situation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sitting in that position isn't good for your posture either. Theyhave us sitting for 8hrs a week day. (Besides recess, extra ciricularss, & lunch)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes. With limited learning (most of the time). Smart enough to run the machines and dumb enough to not know they're getting messed over for the adult world.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: and then they build the factory's abroad, for cheaper labor
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @stefberg-kk1jl  Did you mean "factories"?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And the funny thing is factory’s don’t want you to sit down. Got to do the job standing even if you could do the same job sitting down.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @tjholmes66  That’s only due to ignorance. Try researching a topic before presenting an opinion on it. It’s not a contested issue; it’s just not openly discussed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If it were affordable, there’s a lot of degrees I would go for just for the sake of learning (mainly art/music related, but some others as well). Since it’s not, I’m doing strictly what I need to get enough to have a roof over my head and at least two meals per day (I can go without heating or electricity, but I want breakfast and dinner)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I majored in STEM due to it supposedly being a more lucrative path, but the whole time in uni I wish I could done art classes instead since that’s my passion. I didn’t even have time to take them as electives, or had the time for language learning classes. I miss what could’ve been.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm in college rn going for a art degree in Graphic Design. Thankfully that career area seems to be doing well, but I do worry about debt and not being able to live comfortably ya know?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ha you sound like my kid. She triple majored with a minor in music before getting her masters ten months later and I think she would still be in school if Google hadn’t recruited her. They liked that she liked to learn new things from Astrophysics to Italian. I was happy to pay for it all because it made her happy but I’m glad she is off my payroll now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: me too, im a little stuck on what im meant to do 😵‍💫
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i got my human dev degree on ACCIDENT, bc i was facinated with the social sciences due to a video game. if i wasn't full of anxiety i woulda gone for a broadcasting degree too! And taken some music classes for fun >:3
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same. Scale back your commitments when that happens.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Only do what’s required. Don’t speak out. Become part of the scenery. You’re more likely to be let go by trying to be a hero than promoted so don’t bother.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Jagonz844  best advice here.  Do your job, don't do unpaid overtime, don't expect raises or promotions.  When you want a raise or promotion, get another job at another company.  Rinse/repeat.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey I'm autistic too and feel your pain.  Feel like I get taken advantage of at pretty much every job I work. I could tell story after story after story. The one girl who did nothing like in your story, who I was training, and was making $3 an hour more than I was
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No that’s true even doing something like a cafe job, if I do a job fast they then expect me to do all the other jobs fast and make me do it while some of them would just sit down and do nothing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i relate so much, as an undiagnosed autistic person who is trying to handle a full time job where i'm constantly being asked to do more but not being paid enough, i'm exhausted and struggling.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I can relate. First of all I’m autistic as well. My parents raised me to think that I don’t have any value outside of what I output at either school or work. They wouldn’t speak to me if I had bad grades. So I became an honors straight A student. Carried this mentality over into my first jobs only to be rewarded with more work and less pay than those that didn’t try. It’s unbelievable!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Other countries treat burnout like the medical condition it is instead of a lifestyle. The tradeoff though is being taxed to the high heavens. Seems like they're still happier than we are though
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I know it can be a challenge (and debilitating at times, let’s be real), but it’s actually a gift . Unlike others, you are very aware of your strain and this will help you in the long run.  NT get burnt out just as easily, but usually they turn to substance abuse and don’t realize they have a problem until a sudden mid-life crisis. Sometime down the line they have an extrem and sudden crash.  Take the time to find yourself and a community you enjoy. Rooting for you!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think corporations had the greed  problem ever since the start of corporations
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @hatter5834 If by the system you mean the process of corporatization, then I 100% agree. It's gaslit the boomers into thinking this is the way things should work, drained the optimism of Gen X for participating, blamed the millennials when things started to fall apart, is now antagonizing zoomers for not being able to or wanting to pick up the pieces, and worst of all, managed to turn us all against one another.  Sure, it could be argued that at one point in time the corporatization process represented the most effective means of controlling competition in which the most efficient or resourceful means of production from labor was rightfully rewarded, but clearly those days are long gone. Now it's turned into a signaling contest of which people already in positions of influence and authority you know and how many of them you know - regardless of their demonstrable competencies or qualifications - that you need to schmooze up to so that you too can be boosted to a position of influence and authority regardless of your own demonstrable competencies or qualifications. It's not for nothing there's such a competency crisis going on in the labor market.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @RealRatchet oh yeah I’d definitely cope with not being able to AFORD TO BE ALIVE
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You are just blaming the problem on someone else. No one in this generation wants to take accountability for their lives.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @HasanAbiOfficial so it’s our fault that corporations are not paying us enough.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Surely there's something that could serve as grounds for a lawsuit there?? Wrongful termination maybe? God I'm pissed off just reading your comment, I'm sorry that happened to you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: literally yup. too much work, not enough pay, so workers don't work--as is their right
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Welcome to zero-sum games, a narcissist's playground.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hadn't even reached that thought damn  The idea that even if you somehow voided all debt, held a stable.job with supportive management and included paid leave and logistics planning, was connected to and maintained regular checkups with a free government health service and had sufficient time to relax and have downtime- in what place of the world or just what world would this be worth pursuing right now? let alone rewarding and progressive for people  Even the idea of what we could do for the world in 50 years has basically become so abandoned it's an uncanny liminal horror to think about it in the way some people think wistfully about what they would do when they were grown up during early childhood
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @AlexQuinn-f2r I don’t know what you’re all off about with this horror scene. I left school and worked my ass off, didn’t complain to everyone, didn’t say the world was against me, but  got knocked down by so many people, dealt with drug abuse, got payed pennies for professional work and so much more. But I pushed through, I worked through shitty times and I’ve been promoted twice because I didn’t blame my problems on other people. I could’ve said what you guys are saying and said it was all for nothing. That is loser, victim mentality. You will always fail with that mindset
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THIS.  I did everything right . I'm extremely driven , worked hard , did a STEM degree , got an above average white collar job straight out of college then worked hard and lived like a pauper while everyone else had families and went clubbing or on holiday.    I'm now better off than all of them , certainly,  but I'm STILL barely comfortable . I still have to budget.  I still cant afford to eat out without pinching pennies . I still can't get decent quality healthcare and end up running up the credit card every time I want to treat myself to a nice meal or new clothes .   I'm better off than most , but what was the point of it all if I did everything we are told to do to succeed , and my success has been to be at a mediocre quality of life ?   Sacrificing everything for mediocre is not a functional society.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As gen z that grew up in the lower class, my initial reaction was 'what boot straps?' tbh
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s no wonder why kids want to be YouTubers and influencers. It’s pretty much the only way they can make it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There’s nothing to be happy about like thinking about the fact if you worked 40 hrs a week pretty much all that money would go on rent and you wouldn’t not be able to have a life is just said, and I think our generation really just don’t take shit, because people basically had to work their whole lives but at least they got a house out of it, our generation is basically expected to never retire that just sums it up
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jmdyt3626  I work 40 hrs a week. I make more than double the federal minimum wage an hour. I take whatever overtime they offer. And still; I will never have a house. I can't even afford a single bedroom, single bathroom apartment. My mother always complains "You're never gonna move out!". IF I COULD, I WOULD!! 😡
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've noticed wages are going up. When I was highschool everyone was flocking to the $15 an hr jobs cuz it was unheard of. Now most job's starting pay is that. Unfortunately, cost of living has gone up so $20 an hr is the new $15 an hr. It's like a never ending cycle 😞
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @woodsyturtle7080  Yeah, a burger should not cost $10.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I wouldn’t be dealing with options trading as a side gig if jobs actually paid well, but it is what it is
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: try looking for work elsewhere and using a new job offer as leverage! i'm not saying that to undermine what you said, it's a legitimate suggestion lol. my friend just used that method & it worked-- she got a raise and an extra week vacation. she's shocked, didn't think it would pay off (literally).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SaraxAdam  I'm a bit puzzled, did she go for the new job or stayed at the old one and used the offer to show she's wanted and that resulted in promotion?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SaraxAdam  I told that to people elsewhere but they said I was entitled. Idk, when I hated my jobs I worked towards solutions. Theres still a lot of real problems in the world but I think that approach is the most productive and successful for oneself.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Presented so well! I'm a Baby Boomer. Thank you for helping me understand what our newest adults are facing. Not sure what the answer is but you are shining a huge light on the problem. One thing I really appreciate about the young adults around me is how they can think outside of the box and come up with new options. Right, that won't pay the bills. But when I'm with a group of young adults I feel hope for the future. Please hang in there, Gen Z'ers. I now appreciate what your challenges are.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There is absolutely no incentive to have a work ethic. My husband worked extremely hard at his job, 10-12 hours a day, all of the higher-ups like him and he has great relationships with other employees and customers. He got really good reviews and he was excited for his raise...it was less than a dollar. That raise doesn't even keep up with inflation, so technically he's making less than he did when he started in context with the economy and cost of living. When he confronted his bosses about it they said they can't give him anymore because they would have to give everybody more pay because of inflation...yet the company is making more profit than ever and still growing. Why work hard when it won't get rewarded at all.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well, they are going to be paid nothing, own nothing, but are expected to give you everything ? What did you expect ?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: At this point, believing I have a future feels like believing in Santa Claus
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Don't forget the risk of automation! One factor of picking a career path is "will robots/A.I. replace my job and make my education and experience irrelevant to my hire-ablility, meaning that I adopted the 'grindset' with all of the stress associated with it, and went into debt for nothing?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think a big part of this that everyone is missing is that Gen z is the first group to be fully aware of the fact that America is the only “first world” country (and I say that VERY loosely) that pushes this mindset of living to work. We know that our European counterparts have health insurance and paid vacation and maternity leave, and we might get some sick time off if we live in a liberal area. I currently work for an Italian company, and even though my job is harder than any job I’ve had previously, it’s infinitely less stressful because everyone in corporate is Italian (except for me and like 3 other people). We’re all working from home/ out of office from the first week of December to the third week of January. Everyone in the company who works 15 hours or more gets full benefits, which are great and very affordable. I was out for 3 weeks sick after only being there for a month, and they told me to take another 3 days when I got back, just in case I didn’t feel 100%. Fully paid. We see these things being the bare minimum, literally the law, everywhere but here. They can continue to not hire us for maybe 10 more years at absolute maximum before their entire labor market dies and retires, but one way or another America is gonna have to make some adjustments for us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Calling Gen Z ungrateful for not wanting to work more than they're paid? It's insane, if corporations started wringing us dry, why is it inappropriate to wring them dry back?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've watched older friends and family struggle with loans and overworking themselves to the grave, I refuse to burn myself out for some company.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I do the same amount of grinding and overachieving as my mother did.   The difference? Rent keeps rising but my paycheck does not
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm genz (27) been laid off 6 times because of lack of seniority. There is literally no reason to give more than the bare minimum, especially when your job pays the same rate for your position as literally every other business out there.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z will see the collapse of society before they are even allowed to become so integrated they blame the next generation for being lazy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thinking of my mom's stepdad who worked a full time job with a 5hr commute everyday and then got diagnosed to be dying within the next few months literally 3 days after retiring. He had finally bought the house of his dreams too.   Companies are not families, they will replace you if you don't function well. I think it is hilarious that people point to Gen Z with terms such as, "Quiet quitting", when in reality it  just means Gen Z does not identify their workplace as a foundational structure within their lives like prior generations with more security within their employment did. Back then there was at least some semblance or illusion of meritocracy. Nowadays, we don't even have that.The dramatized TikToks to me are exaggerated versions of this shift in the workforce. The numerous lay offs from jobs that were deemed safe have only fuelled the detachment. I have heard a million regrets of people who were old or on their deathbed, but not once have I heard they wished they had worked harder or more. It is not that Gen Z has wildly different priorities than previous generations, it’s that socially speaking, Gen Z does not care to uphold the image of “Hard worker” while losing sight of the things that will actually matter in the long run. A company is not going to be at your deathbed, a company will not hold your hand if you get chronically ill, regardless of how many things you sacrificed for it. Work is just work.  And if you are not careful, you’ll retire an empty husk of yourself. Because once your desk is cleaned out and your workspace items of 50 years are packed into an old dusty cardboard box, you may just exit the building you resided your entire life in and won’t have anywhere else to go.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In addition to all of this, i think older generations need to put more effort into working with and teaching Gen Z and be more understanding that jobs are learned. Most people don't start a corporate job in their early teens so now we have 22 year olds who have never worked in a formal environment showing up on their first day with no experience. Yet some employers seem to expect us to have these skills immediately after the university hands us our degree (plus that 4+ years of experience on the entry level job posting).   When i got my first job out of University it was obvious my older colleagues didn't immediately understand how many things I simply didn't know how to do. Learning office and departmental norms was like learning a new language and i am grateful my older colleagues took the time to teach me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Before my junior year of high school, I remember having passions. I loved baking, I loved drawing and writing, I loved movies and stories, I wanted to help the community and the environment, I was learning a second language. I’m in my first year of university now and it feels like there’s nothing left in me to keep trying. Everything is exhausting, things I like doing are near impossible, classes I really do enjoy and want to learn more in I just can’t do the schoolwork for. I don’t care what my career is, I don’t care what my job is. Everything feels like it’s only going to get worse and I can’t do shit, so what’s the point?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm gen z What I realised about job searching "I'm too overqualified for standard hospitality and retail work but I'm underqualified to do basic admin work." So I went with a couple recruitment agencies (got temp work) and focused on my hobbies and interests. Now I'm working in my dream job that suits my qualifications.   Success isn't linear. Success is what you make it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 24, born in 2000. I graduated college a year and a half ago, did everything I was told to do. Studied hard, fought through covid and made it out the other end. However now, a year and a half after graduating, I'm living with my parents and stuck working a low-paying retail job that barely relates to my degree. I've applied to hundreds of "entry level" jobs, went through a gauntlet of 3 interviews for a pair (including one 1hr long interview), and have ended up rejected from them all. It's been incredibly frustrating, and has left me really burnt out. I've got a mountain of debt to pay off, but I'm barely getting paid enough for groceries. I can't see myself buying a house, much less paying rent somewhere. I work hard, and I'm trying to get a better job while also trying to get promoted. But it's hard not to feel exhausted when all your hard work leads to getting paid poverty wages. I can't even begin to imagine trying to start a family, I mean I'm still scrambling for pennies in an attempt to create some sort of stable foundation for myself! Like, how are we supposed to live? I'm just so tired, and I really don't want the bulk of my working years to be spent in the retail mines. I'm really regretting getting my degree at this point, like I'd have been better off spending those 5 years building up the work experience these companies seem to value above a degree.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: At 26 after clearing all my debt and saving a few grand and still being unable to progress in my life because of the cost of living; I’ve essentially given up on having stable future for myself..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel robbed after having gone through college and now I'm saddled with debt and not using my degree. I would never do it again and I caution every single young person I see about college.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I like when I heard someone say this, “ effort = pay. I’m not working more than I’m paid.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen X nurse here. We actually had a Gen Z nurse that fraudulently clocked work hours that she did not work and got paid for them. She is having very serious repercussions as a result of that. We now have a replacement Gen Z nurse for her that is absolutely great. You can’t judge the whole Gen based on a few bad apples.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You do not know how much your recognition matters. All fucking day we are subjected to being called lazy wastes of space who deserve not even the bare minimum because we aren’t outputting 150% more than everyone older than us for pat that doesn’t even reflect 20% effort, thank you for understanding and not belittling my generation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you. Thank you so much. I really appreciate your words especially since you're from an older generation. I'm tired of seeing older adults belittle us young adults. Thank you for the encouragement
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The answer is wealth redistribution. Taxing the rich. Unions. Medicare for all.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We need UBI. $1000/m for current unemployment figures to under $90B, a speck in terms of federal spending, and it will save everyone a bunch of money: estimated $300B is spent on work-related stress in the healthcare budget, and we'll make up for it with a healthy, loyal and dedicated workforce that knows the value of what they are working for. Younger generations will actually have something to hope for, some viable promise of life where their basic necessities are human rights.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Straight up. My best friend in my state is a gen x dude (so a little older but the point remains the same). He works for a fucking company that builds rockets and has defense contracts yet after YEARS on the job, still makes barely $20/hr. At his last review, they tried to deny him a raise, citing the same bullshit as your bf was told. My buddy got pretty pissed and demanded a raise and after an insane amount of back and forth, the “best they could do” was LESS THAN FIFTY CENTS. They are making record profits and alll drive new sports cars.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "We'll do that when we grow, but first let's invest this growth into the company. Oops, now we can't fulfill our promise. Bummer!"

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: exactly! we are faced with so many very suddenly developing threats in an era where things are already tough in every possible section of life!! all creative jobs already had it rough....now ai is getting favored by the non artists. it grew too much and now those of us who are burnt out may also rely on it or feel hopeless
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Didn't go back to school because of this exact thing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: losing my grip on any writing or editorial jobs bc of this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you want a hardworking workforce treat them well, give them healthcare, paid holidays, good maternity leave etc. Workers deserve to have a life beyond the workplace otherwise what is the point. Americans need to realise how they have been shafted by their governments and corporations
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i'm from the uk, where it's very much "live to work". the jobmarket in the uk is awful. all these benefits mean nothing when you're unable to work anywhere that actually provides these benefits. there are enough food/retail customer service jobs, but so few entry-level jobs that you can actually make a decent career out of.   i know only two people in my generation who might be able to afford to buy a house in the next 5 years (excluding people with parents who will help them pay for/give them a property).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Nat-qi4eg  yeah, what you’re describing is the same here, but we also don’t have health care
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This. We are getting a raw deal and we know it. It started with unpaid lunch hour, slashed benefits, and the corporations just keep takign and taking and taking more from us. We have a garbage quality of life compared to Europe. Every time I have to navigate health insurance it fills me with rage. I have no time off, jobs don't even have to pay any PTO at all. Continually not having any vacations for years (except for unemployment!) is how you kill someone's soul. I feel like a slave. Meanwhile all the rich shitheads everywhere getting so much money for doing nothing and being lazy parasites, it's enough to push you postal.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Ella-g2m The EU has umployment problems and many EU nations are not first world. Parts of EU have rolling blacks much like California. Look at whats going on in California where costs are higher for things because of work benefit requirements. The Silicon Valley layoffs were a consequence of all these practices - they could not afford it. California runs a deficit every year due to all their social programs.  All US workers/families could have these work benefits if govt policies didn't pay people to sit around and pay for wars all over the world, but instead prioritized corporate tax benefits only if employers provide health care and benefits to workers.  Instead ppl want single player medicaid. Things cost money. EU health care is great if you are healthy but God forbid you are ill. Most cancer treatment there has a 50% lower survival rate than US even for younger ppl. Getting surgery has a wait list of 6months plus for minor surgeries like hernia repairs. We really don't want a single payer but need competition in the health system to encourage cost cutting. The hospital systems and insurance companies make all the money colluding with govt.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hi, Italianhere and I can definitely tell you that companies dont give us literally anything else but those basics, thats why we all live still at home with our parents at 30. we cant afford anything else
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @giuliatrantonelli  I understand that but my point is that the thing you consider basic are absolutely unheard of here. My parents keep saying how absolutely insanely lucky I am that my boss is letting me go home for Christmas. That’s what it’s like here.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m Italian, and I can assure you that over here it’s not that much better. I turned 30 last week, I’m disabled and jobless. I busted my ass off to keep up with the absurd demands and nonsense that were thrown at me. And with most people I talk with, unless they were already rich or at least very well off because of generational wealth (and I know only two that could be considered in that category) we’re all struggling so much to have way less than our basic needs met. It’s inhumane.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The EU is not perfect either. Some countries are way better than others. I am a 31 year old doctor, married to another doctor. I can honestly say that if we stay in our country, we will not be able to afford to buy a house in the next 5 years. I’m also currently pregnant, and the maternity leave is very disappointing (the money I get doesn’t even cover rent), they do allow a leave of 4-5 months though (I think in the US they allow a month). I feel like all the years of education we went through, were for nothing. What is the point? We are working all the time, and getting paid the bare minimum.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @katch2511  I had a job as an insurance agent in the past and did not even have my own health insurance.  I quit my job while pregnant after my boss who was a female threatened to cut my pay in half for going to the emergency room one day. No wonder I had a miscarriage 😢
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I agree with most of what you said, but out for three weeks sick after only being their a month? That is absolutely ridiculous. What poor soul was having to do their job and yours for the same pay during that time?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also from the UK and it’s not all better the other side if the pond whilst jobs do have to provide these benefits there are almost no entry level jobs from my friends in secondary (high) school only one has a graduate level jobs we all have degrees we are all working minimum wage jobs or job searching whilst living with our parents . The other issues as previously mentioned such as cost of living also means that we are less motivated to work unpaid overtime in order to advance within a country as we can use that time for a second job, side hustle or looking for jobs that might pay more.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @scarlett-bv5nd  it’s like that here too but college is 20k a year
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The first world countries is not just the western countries, as other commenters have stated, Japan should be considered as well. There are also several large economies in Asia that should be discussed - Singapore and china.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There was a time when the US needed to push that mindset. It was 1946 to 1991, because that was the time when the US was footing the bill for Europe's defense against the Soviet Union.   Then the Soviet Union dissolved, so the US could relax, right?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @NJGuy1973  We weren't even like that in the early Cold War; in the early Cold War we had a Keynesian economic policy, which leads to FAR better outcomes in income inequality than a neoliberal economic policy, which is now the chief fiscal policy of the United States.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @NJGuy1973  tbh once the US and sovjet union got ICBMs the whole rest of the military was obsolete and a waste of money The EU was founded at the seventies and they guaranteed to defend each other.   Nowaday, the combination of DE/FR/IT are already outspending Russia on the military. Zero reason for the US to spend 7 times more than Russia
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If I wanna work in a European job should I learn the language, or is it okay if I stick with English?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Maxlne-P  depends on the industry. Most office jobs are ok with just English, and you can learn the language as you go. In healthcare you have to speak the language (almost fluently).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Maxlne-P  it would be extremely beneficial to learn. I don’t speak Italian yet but I’m struggling because of it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My full time job has one of the most generous PTO policies of any employer in my region. It would be illegal for an employer to have such a limited PTO policy in at least 35 countries i have checked.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We, the citizens of the USA, are treated as the world's personal bank account, and I for one am sick of it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Omg, are they hiring marketers? Haha.  We need to get the younger generations more politically active. If they ALL voted, we could have the nice things you mentioned.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the UK is the same.... we get free healthcare but it is awful and often misses people's illness. ik a girl whose cancer was overlooked at 18 for months by the NHS, one private appointment picked it up that day
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's good you have a caring boss.  Most American boomer work mindset is toxic
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen x and millenials realized it too, just most of the masses are clueless, making it seem like this is "new" information
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am a person living in a technically third world country. What do you mean ya all can't even afford food??? Like I can't even imagine having to look at price tags in grocery store. 💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @unavezms8167  I mean people are shopping at the discount store and not eating fresh fruit and vegetables for weeks if not months. Cost of food has gone up something like 3x in 3 years
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you are treated as less than human, then the work you do should match that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m in the exact same situation and feel the exact same way. I hardly apply to any jobs in my field. Why? Just so some HR rep can throw my resume in the trash? Over and over and over? Before they even give me a chance? Or waste my time with an interview when they already know they're not going to hire me? I'm just demoralized.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In 24 myself living at hoke slaving away at retail just the same. I get paid almost nothing and my parents had two kids by the time they were my age. They complain about it but juat simply dont understand the different world we live in now
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yuuuuup. same situation bro, right down to the retail. I got my resume so optimized, that the only thing in my way is THEM and how they treat me after i speak my piece.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 28, no debt, married, and we have $60k in our account. Can confirm we still can't do anything. Buying a house isn't possible still. Even with a fistful of worthless currency, it's still so incredibly hard.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Stardust10109 how the heck did you save 60k? Me & my husband are both 27, both work blue collar jobs, no college, we have a mortgage and his truck loan no other debt, but were barely able to save $500 a month

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Trevbotics  Gotta build our own cool new towns

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: do you have an associates? you could be a teacher in some states, even a police officer. very stressful job though, i wouldnt do it. my staff agency gatekeeps jobs. they only offer me ONE specific position. pays dirt. when i try asking for another option they ghost me or become evasive. eventually blocked my number
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: go trades. lots of unions/workforces will pay for your schooling and youll have better opportunities to make money out the gate. the pay cap is also higher than a lot of people think, especially if you pick the right trade
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There should have been PLENTY of people in your life who should have said to you:  if you're going to college, you BETTER be majoring in a career that is going to pay for it.   I am really sorry your generation has been saddled with the high cost of schooling, I was lucky that I didn't have that in the early 90's.   BUT, if you went to college, saddled yourself with debt, and now have a career that can't pay for it .... yeah, you sound like your fucked.    Someone should have warned you away from that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That was your choice to get a useless degree. I didnt go to college and do great. I might return to get a higher paying job. But its just the sheep mentality to follow the basic process and then complain about it afterwards
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @HasanAbiOfficial Define “useless degree”.  A degree with useful skills doesn’t even guarantee you decent employment anymore. Most HR departments spend all of but 6 seconds looking at your resume and some now want masters degrees for jobs that previously only required a bachelors degree.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @HasanAbiOfficial you’re saying sheep mentality about a lie that is sold to children their entire lives? And then when they’re old enough to be “legally” adults (but mentally still teenagers duh) they’re just supposed to not take the path every “trustworthy” adult has told them to take? That’s some major insight to expect from 18 year olds. I’m guessing you were so smart and different at that age you could never do what was expected of you?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @HasanAbiOfficial  yikes put away the fedora 😅"I'm going to assume you got a useless degree because you're not using it while also bragging that I'm going to go back to school to get a degree to get a higher paying  job". Do you even hear yourself? Just because I'm not using it doesn't mean the degree itself is useless. The field I'm in is extremely high-competition and I regret going to college mainly due to the amount of debt. If degrees were more affordable, this wouldn't be near as much of an issue.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We had a boomer do that at my work 😂 that’s not a generation thing, that’s a untrustworthy person thing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s more about trends but I question how tracked older generations were. Seems like we only integrated more hardcore analytics in during millennials.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What happened to her? Did she get sued?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I mean we had a gen X employee do the same soo yeah.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yea but it's a LOT of bad apples. That's coming from a Gen Z, who employed a lot of Gen Z. I saw more bad than good apples by far

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In government work there are few ways to get fired and time card fraud is the number one way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's almost like every person is an individual...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah here to. But we also have a group of interns not showing up to shifts and then when called out let their parents call.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have a coworker doing this except we're on salary and they just always show up late and leave early. I hope my coworker faces consequences. If their manager asked security for their badge swipes... Game over.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @netteloveszebras But if they're salaried, aren't they evaluated based on work output instead of time at a desk?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @netteloveszebras  I think you're mistaking salaried workers for workers on an hourly wage. If they're not in trouble bc they're getting the job done, you might be the one who's been fooled into thinking you have to be there 9 to 6.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @netteloveszebras Do they get their work done, though?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You’re right. But there is something about this generation that is very vocal about not wanting to work. Maybe I’m crazy but people have always had to work to live.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @HasanAbiOfficial very vocal or online more? Can’t compare apples to oranges. Previous generations didn’t have a way to tell millions of people how they feel about work. Idk that is my perspective on how “common” it seems nowadays.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @HasanAbiOfficial  EXACTLY "people have always had to work to live" yes! and jobs do not pay enough to cover the cost of living anymore, thats the whole problem.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​ @HasanAbiOfficial  doing something out of necessity is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from doing it out alone a genuine desire to do it. Saying that we don't WANT to work doesn't mean that we don't suck it up and go to work anyway. It's just shit for us right now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: An unspoken thing amongst all this is that older generations just had a more relaxed work environment. When they came home from work, they didn’t work. As simple as that. At work, you’d still have time to socialize and chat. Now, workdays spill over into the rest of your day and you’re taking meetings and replying to emails 24/7 without getting paid for that time. Of course you’re going to have to turn down meetings to go eat and work out.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Dude. Thank you for making this. It genuinely brought me so much comfort & you took my thoughts and laid them out in front of me. Ironically it gives me an ounce of hope to know I'm not the only one of this generation that is immensely struggling in every aspect even though they're seemingly doing exactly what they're "supposed to do". Thank you times a million.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: had an employer that decided to punish closing shift employees for staying late & making sure everything was done & prepared for the next day by writing them up. makes thousands of dollars a week at one location, but can only give the long term employees a $1 raise if they charge consumers $5 more for each service.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was a golden retriever employee when i started my first job i did everything i could to be a team player and go above and beyond and all it got me was a bunch of responsibilities that i got no additional pay for and i was over worked until i finally quit. It burnt me out and that burn out lasted 2 years. I jumped from job to job until  i got fired for the first time because my motivation to work was so low. I applied for jobs for 6 months before i managed to land a new job but that time in between gave me the re-set i needed and i felt ready to really commit to my new job. So far my new work place is great, my coworkers are awesome and it has good structured management. How you are treated at work makes a huge difference
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 16:44 I live with a diagnosed narcissistic severely abusive father. I have diagnosed complex PTSD, Anxiety, fluctuating depression, and issues with disassociation. Older relatives keep scoffing at me or screaming at me, asking me why I don't WANT to leave, my dad claims I won't leave because I'm HIS abuser. I can't leave. I'm literally am unable to. I'm 21. I've been trying to get out for almost FIVE years and I'm still STUCK here. No wonder the ⚰️ rate is so high in our generation. The economy is TRAPPING us in miserable homes and lives we don't want. America. Is. Unlivable. How could they EVER let this happen. This was supposed to be a country of hope and now everyone wants to leave or IS leaving.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wait. What! 14 minutes in and as an Australian I can NOT believe these higher education debt amounts. We have to pay for university but only when we earn a certain amount, and while it does accumulate some interest and is by no means perfect… it’s so much more doable than what some of these American TikTok’s are talking about. No young adult should be facing hundreds of thousands of dollars debt for education. What a way to wreck havoc on their futures and overall stress levels and mental health.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I worked 2 years in a dental office. I managed to get one good raise when i started but soon after i lost my work partner because she quit.   I worked 12 hour shifts, twice a week by myself for 3 months because they hadnt hired a new partner for me. When I asked for a raise they told me i wasnt doing enough. This happened to me twice except the second time the partner has been fired. I told them i didnt wasnt to do the 12s alone again and they basically told me to suck it up. The 3rd time i asked they told me i had to cross train if i wanted a raise. I did that and all i got was an extra 50 cents.   I was making less then someone who just started, while I was cross trained and doing 3 peoples jobs than someone who was just doing one. We also lost our original bonus structure so i was making less than i was when i first started, while doing double the work and supposedly getting better pay.   I ended up working a second job on top of this job because of that issue and found a lot of people my age in the same boat of 2 jobs trying to make it through the week. We are all exhausted
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Working over 40 hours a week and still not be able to afford a house is indeed ridiculous, but I do think we focus a bit much on the "not being able to afford a house" part. For me (also born in the border between Gen Z and Millennial), the focus is much more on the part about enjoying life than the money my work produces. I can be able to afford a house and have a nice living, but I still don't want to work if I it takes up 95% of my time, not even if it was like 60% or something similar. You get one life, that's it, and we're forced to waist it on work. Don't give a damn if I'm rich if I can't spend time with my loved ones, go outside, read and do things. Also, I do think we could work much much less globally, if we stopped consuming so much, but that's another topic. Great video!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Zillenial here— Worked my ass off, was eager to learn and improve, improved the pipelines we had at work including setting up what order tasks should go in, was given more responsibilities, was asked to manage outsourcing, was always 2-4 weeks ahead of due dates, did a ton of bug fixing.. I asked for a raise as I saw the post for a new hire for the same job but with less responsibilities was starting off 4K more than me (also found out other people were making the same amount the post had but doing less than me) and what did that get me? Nothing. I got laid off. : ) Def in the boat of just doing the bare minimum if working hard gets you nowhere.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 24:05 refusing to hire gen z is literally dooming your workforce to extinction within a generation (because I doubt any employer saying this is going to want to hire gen alpha down the line).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 27:05 it's basic psychology, it's the Stanford marshmallow experiment brought to fruition, it's broken promises and their consequences.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Losing my mom to cancer, and my niece being born, made me realize how important little moments are in life. I worked hard up until this point when I realized that life is more than the work I’m doing for corporate America.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 36:45 how will enrolling in Peterson's $500/year, non-accredited academy help the average millennial and Gen Z? It will predicably be ignored by any serious person, hiring manager, what have you. Is this a serious suggestion? Is a non-acceedited online academy really all that creative? All I see is a $500 annual pit for naive folks to throw their money into.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 4:52 Yeah, school should teach you that. But it doesn't. I have yet to hear someone whose efforts, work ethics, or actual skills in problem solving or group working were ever prized over someone who is just more apt at understanding maths or memorising science or historical dates. I was good at that. I could easily cramp everything and get it done last moment, never learned time management, and never learned to work in a group. I had so many classmates who cheated, and they never got caught, so they never got in trouble. The school system worldwide isn't promoting the learning of the skills it should. Especially when there are so many people who don't benefit from the rigidity of the system.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I like this corner of the internet. It validates all my experiences. I don’t feel so crazy or isolated.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: German, Gen Z here.   i'm disabled and neurodivergent and despite understanding school stuff, it never stopped burning me out since childhood. School is not accessible for everyone. its a very specific way of learning and if you dont fit in, you're done for.   Kids with memory issues, dyscalcia, dyslexia etc etc etc are more likely to fail, socially anxious and/or autistic kids or anyone that gets overstimulated easily may miss classes due to that or won't be able to learn at home due to constant exhaustion.  school breaks werent breaks bc it was just loud and full. too many strangers making too much noise. with that it was 6 or more school lessons and breaks being nonstop input, expectations, and stress and overstimulation.  i dont know if i'll be able to work normally as i'm in a wheelchair now since my body gave in. i wouldnt stand a chance in America.  also not everyone got a home that supports or loves them or is a good place to be at for various reasons.   maybe Gen Z-ers just have actual standarts and selfrespect. maybe its not our fault. maybe its the fault of older generations for letting it get to a point where work and school isn't accessible for many and does not make ends meet without overworking your body till old age for barely scraping by.  i have friends in the US, that do not have good home lives, but their work does not pay enough to be able to escape. how tf are they supposed to even be somewhat able to work enough to make ends meet, not to mention live a satisfying life?  and then its just "gen Z is depressed". i wonder why-------

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you haven’t entered college yet, I recommend community colleges if you have a local one! That’s what I’m doing and it’s less than a thousand dollars a semester and financial aid can sometimes cover the first few years of education, depending on the school. A few extra years of college and working part time to transfer to a university and having no student loans and a degree is worth it, at least to me. Just a thought for those who aren’t sure!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yep! My job will call you in on your days off and when you say no you’re in trouble ! It’s my DAY OFF but if you don’t come in it’s just as bad and no showing a scheduled shift! So even in your day off.. your on call …
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was told my job I recently started would be from 6 to 2-2:30 only to find it was expected of me to stay until 3:30 or 4 pm and I very quickly quit don’t gaslight me into thinking I’ll have my afternoons free if it’s not true
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @geekgirl616  I feel you. Our job gives days off based the no. of hours worked. (They were soo excited to mention that during my orientation).  Initially they'd apologize if they weren't able to schedule all the days off in the same month because of 'short staffing'.  Now they get upset/offended if you enquire about your missing days off. They act as though they've done you a huge favor by even giving you one.  I now understand why this department is perpetually short staffed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No fr. "On the grind" this and "grindset" that and then mfs wonder why they burn out. But then again, we feel the need to grind due to the toxic work culture from corporations demanding more and more from us for a cheap pizza day at work and maybe a vending machine if we did REALLY good!

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @clayton1738  Not necessarily. I've been in a similar situation as the person who originally commented, and while I can't say  whether they're actively trying to leave their environment or not, I do know that this mindset does not originate from giving up before even starting--it originates from trying all possible options and still getting nowhere.   On top of all of the mental disorders the original commenter  has from living in a toxic environment, they're also trying to stabilise themselves enough to plan and build for a future of financial stability, independence, and mental sanity.  I'm fortunate and grateful to move past that unstable period of my life, and for that to be reality, all while living with a toxic family, the desire for a better life has to be as important as breathing essentially.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yup fellow Aussie here, for reference my 4.5 years was 21k and has grown to 23k since I graduated in 2021 because I haven't paid due to being just under the threshold. From some of these American tik toks I've seen, some people are paying that amount per year + interest 😱 no wonder they're coming out with 100k+ of debt when they finish!

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The student debt support and the help of the administration at the uni I went to after I had to drop out in my final year due to critical health issues I was neglecting in favour of trying to complete the course is one of the few things I have respect for in relation to the  government and administrative support here in Australia  Although I do have mixed feelings knowing that despite my GP appointments being mostly bulk-billed and receiving the maximum amount of the disability support pension- I am still trying to survive just being able to maintain my parent's house without it falling apart due to construction corner cutting and effective criminal negligence- I burnt through all my savings this year trying to deal with critical engineering hazards in the property and said savings were only saved because I got locked out of my bank account due to a malware breach at the start of the year and my account was left abandoned in an idle state for months until I could regain placeholder access while processing ID theft account deletion and documentation re-issuing  It's better by an immeasurable amount that the US but it's breaking me away slowly knowing that this is supposed to be the best
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Comments like this genuinely make me feel like crying. (Not your fault, please don't feel bad.) It just reminds me I'm destined to work myself to death until I inevitably get too sick & can't afford my hospital bills & die just because I was born in the US. It feels like watching kids having fun from the opposite side of a fence alone. I'm 40. I've been paying my student loans for a decade and they've barely gone down while being my largest monthly bill. I can't do anything an adult should be able to. Ugh. Sorry, not your fault. Had to vent I guess.

I just hope that the certification in IT Support that I’m taking will mean something and the fact I have no social group outside of my family makes me look like a shiny enough work mule to get hired. I would love to have friends a romantic partner maybe a home, but I just think that they’re dreams that I can only have when playing the Sims.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just turned 14, and honestly, it feels like the world is setting my whole generation up to struggle before we even get started. Every time I look around, the economy feels like this massive storm we’re expected to walk straight into. Prices keep going up, wages barely move, and it’s like everything you need to live is slowly drifting out of reach.  People always tell us to think about our future, but how are we supposed to picture anything good when buying a house already seems impossible? Even adults with full-time jobs can’t afford basic stuff without drowning in debt. So what chance do me and my friends have by the time we’re old enough to be on our own?  Sometimes it feels like the idea of owning property, building a life, or even just staying financially stable is turning into a fantasy. And the scariest part is that we’re expected to “work hard” and magically make it happen, even though the entire system feels rigged against us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly even though Corporate blames AI, it's just the Higher-Ups making an employee do more at lesser after firing the rest, so that they make more profit, John McCarthy, the father of AI, said AI was made to reduce work days/hours, not to reduce the number of people that work, which speaks volumes of what is happening.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@ThunderTheBlackShadowKitty It's also arguably harder to build something from the ground up, that being said, there *is* a legitimate issue with ceo's and corporate overlords firing people because they made ever so slightly less than expected, to not have to pay them.   My recommendation is to build, and create something yourself, and then you can determine what you want to do with that.   I think the corporate overlords he's talking about mainly are also known bad companies that value profits over lives, not the numerous other CEO's and owners that keep their prices low and hire more because it's more about people than peofits.   Again, make your own company, and you can choose to pay them however.

This is the soul-sucking nature of life under a collapsing empire. America is a genocidal banana republic with nukes. It's not worth even trying to live here anymore. When the government starts noticing massive brain drain and a shrinking tax base, they'll rethink their policies - but not a day before. PS. I'm late Gen X and we were told all the same lies, and called all the same names. The Baby Boomers stole the future of every generation born after them.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The following first posted February  28, 2020.  Humans need to stop infighting long enough to topple our oppressors.  Mitch McConnell is Emperor Palpatine.   Some of you will die, but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make! - Lord Trump  Trump is evil! He ignored this virus until he couldn't ignore it. The steps taken have been deliberately slow to contain this virus, as the government has been deliberately slow to contain this virus, as the government has made huge financial gains in allowing particularly older, retired people to die. No More pay outs each month.  Voting, if still valid, is our  only peaceful, legal recourse. Voting 3rd party is the ONLY WAY to get real humans in power, rather than dynasty families and career politicians. When we realize the 2 parties we are divided over LOVE the division among us. Then and only then may America be great again.   @Justin Y. Lack of knowledge of the Deep State? I just accused our government of mass murder. I understand Deep State. Fact that you refuse to listen, only attack, says too much about you. Clearly you haven't known hardship. Clearly none of this has impacted you negatively.  You are part of the problem,  offering zero solutions.  Calling me stupid really helps your case. Trump has very limited brain power, as evidenced by his rambling, generally repetitive,  Toddler Talks. Although most of us are solely undereducated, Trump really amazes me every time I listen to his banter.  Trump did not close the borders in time. Many flights brought sick folk here. Action wasn't taken until very late February and by then 15 confirmed cases were more than enough to allow airborne, lethal virus upon the world. This is dangerous because common behaviors,  such as shoulder to shoulder events, shopping and working conditions helped this virus along, even as people died in China daily, America went forward 2 full months without any concerns. Then, rather than force the hands of State Officials and put the population through a 2 month quarantine, we've been seeing States react, rather than prepare, all at the natural stages this virus thrives upon, complacency among enough of us to allow the spread to continue. You refusing to see this logic isn't a blight on my mental capacity, just proves you are as simple as our Lord Trump. Likely among those very few, who like many elites, don't care about the plight of the masses, whom I speak for, in this contrived crisis. Trump is calm about the virus because he exists outside the bounds of common folk. Trump and other powerful people would never have to take the risk of infection seriously as they are all well protected by expendable servants or can afford to continue living lavishly distanced from peons such as myself. 9/11 was an inside job and this proves what I've feared since, that the government can perform mass murder and the people will always accept it, hire the next sociopath in line, whichever of the 2 evil divisional parties they aspire to dwell in.   Our educational system is archaic. We could be educating everyone from home.  There are no valid excuses for our current broken schooling, no teachers need lose jobs as the internet is an amazing communication device.  Taxes are broken. Your dollar earned gets hit so many times yet we all accept that blindly.  Medicine is broken. My grandmother died because her selfish daughter needed cable TV more than grandma needed diabetes medicine. Millions suffer inability to afford insulin, despite initially starting out as a gift to humanity from a generous genius, privatized by Evil and Greed, priced beyond reality for most.  Our 2 party system is designed to keep us bickering. Division keeps us docile enough to accept our own government conspiring to murder us.  3rd party candidates are generally real humans, that care about other humans, even, gasp, total strangers and foreigners.  We are all on the same spaceship, Earth. I judge character, not race, not whatever religion folks are born into.   I am old...I am tired of seeing disasters get slow attention from government as poor people die due to delayed or nonexistent help.  It's about time the many take control, with votes, to dethrone the sociopaths that control us, play games with our very lives.   When there are only voluntarily homeless, when the janitor is paid living wage, when a high school graduate can earn enough in food service or retail to support a modest home and essentials while creating a nest egg...when Veterans are are given the same care as congress,  senate or other positions of power, rather than left to suffer and die, when the lowest paying jobs are enough to survive on, then and only then can Ameroca boast of being great.  As it stands, I feel most of us are born into lies we have no control over. It's well orchestrated, as my points are made clear in every satirical broadcast about the plight of the masses, world wide.  Do I want peace, equity and kumbaya? Yeah, I do. Are sociopaths in power oppressing the plebeians? Yeah, they are. Have good Democrats and Republicans existed? Yes...they get blocked by evil at every turn, often resigning due to unbeatable corruption. Do I pity the very people I label simple? You bet I do. I want this planet to be a better place for most, not some...for all, if ever possible.  This covid virus isn't done. It mutates too fast to pin down with a vaccine. We haven't seen the end of covid because we, as a planet, would have to agree on a few ground rules to consider being a functional society.  Most of us just exist and watch, lazily, rather than get directly involved in change. We don't seem to take note that we, the expendable masses, are being ordered to push through life ignoring this virus. It took ONE infection to start a Planet Wide Pandemic. Because we didn't quarantine from January through February, we get to watch innocent and otherwise lives lost daily.  Who are "we" in "We're inthis together "? Certainly not the elite who step on us to avoid harm. I'm furious with humanity as a whole. I'm furious we accept all this death and Trump's Toddler Talks, akin to a Ted Talk without useful insight.   Those of us suffering are many, while the privileged watch the show they created.   When...when will the common folk unite against tyranny, through the only peaceful means we have? Vote out career politicians and dynasty families in favor of real humans beings, with consciousness and compassion for the lowest among us? We won't stop the cycle of abuse by trading Democrats and Republicans, 2 sides of the same evil, corrupt coin. Let that coin land on edge...vote 3rd party, vote for real people with flaws, that understand what struggle is, that have put time behind any of these so-called essential, yet minimum wage jobs...  This economy is screwed...always has been. Vast majority of work available is menial labor, food service, retail, janitors, grocers. A great many take their wages in government,  which is far too big, complex and unsustainable.   Until any job can offer a modest, secure household, until the only homeless are those that volunteer to live "free", until the pill giants are mandated  to make life saving medicine reasonably priced,  we are a selfish, horrid nation, divided by the very people that oppress us, yet too busy fighting amongst ourselves to take any useful action towards a better tomorrow, for the  MANY, not the FEW!

Unfortunately, most of us weren't aware because america does a great job of keeping people unaware.  It was especially easy when we were teens and many adults around us chose to "not be political" aka, ignore the problem until they're old and we have to deal with it.  I guarantee you can find information on rising prices, layoffs reaching a high, climate change causing drastic weather, the american dollar losing it's pull from when you were in grade school.   It's been in our faces for years along with the inaction of people in Congress and politics.  Conditioning and indoctrinating the youth usually leads to herd adults who just need to hear a few buzz words to vote against everyone's best interest.   That didn't work that well for most younger people who were taught to think critically so they created things that would think critically for us like *insert "cutting edge" ai chatbot here*. Fortunately many of us were out of grade/high school when these things became the next technological breakthrough.   All of that to say it wasn't a change that happened over night, it's been slow and gradual.   Idgaf though, I'm not bowing to billionaires. I'd rather eat a cactus whole.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @RetroGigabyte  It is a bunch of things, but it was mostly the shortage in construction and large migration caused by COVID for the recent spike. The long-term trend in increasing prices is mostly due to local land development codes and approval processes, which make building extremely expensive and arduous, and valuable land scarce.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The majority of “landlords” don’t even own the home.. they just work for the mega corp that owns the home and they decide the rent.. and they determine their prices based off a lot of online information that gives them the average income of most people .. so they raise rent accordingly to keep up down
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I know exactly what you mean, and it wasn't just in the US, but in Germany too. My parents purchased a home for $500k back in 2015 and we sold the same house with some interior renovations for $1.7 Mil. We where lucky to reap the benefits of the crazy market because we wanted to move anyway but it's scary to think what people on the receiving end of it must of had to deal with.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's because rich people are turning home to rent business.   Bipartisan effort of doing constant deficit spending, forever war, money printing and aid to Israel.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Breaks my heart till this day. When I was 18 homes were still under 500k in my area. I can afford that now but that same neighborhood doesn't go under 800k for a turn key house. Now I either rent forever or commute 2-3 hours daily if I want a home

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: A lot of that was actually because of women entering the job market and the house market adjusting to dual income status. It permanently made the house market more expensive.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: its fucking ridiculous and it doesn’t even matter how hard some work. they’ll still never get a house as soon as they like, or really ever. politicians dont care about solving real issues, they spit in the faces of americans.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The pandemic-era growth was crazy where everything skyrocketed... and things have just kinda stayed there. Like how 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yea my family got 2 homes back in 2016 for 165 thousand and 110 thousand now there both 780 k
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The median home price is 440,000.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fun story: my mom bought the house I grew up in in 1991 for about $30k. The house was built in 1939; a typical New England colonial; 3 bed, one bath. She passed in 2014. I sold the home in 2017 for about $188,000 (trust me, I did not make that much; there were two mortgages, but one effectively eliminated my college debt, making me the only millennial I know not still paying college loans, which is a whole other issue). That house is now listed on Zillow as being worth... almost $900,000... That is 30 times as much as it cost in 1991. And the state is still one of the poorest states in the country.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Got my house for 250k, I’m 41 and got the house 8 years ago, I got lucky that I found a decent job doing end user IT work that allows me to afford it. I feel for Gen z, if I would have waited a few more years I wouldn’t be able to afford a home. But I also worry about being laid off, if that happens I lose everything.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don’t think you realise how much mass immigration occurred from developing nations to developed nations past 2020 , and now that the developing nation diaspora have accumulated higher wealth they have not only increased demand for housing in the developed nations they reside in but they have also increased estate demand in their original developing nation by reinvesting and purchasing multiple properties/land back home which has now bumped up the cost of living for the locals who are on a local wage. Over 81% of properties are still in private hands rather than publicly listed corporations, although land is being scooped up by government backed corporations the construction for new homes are being regulated heavily so it essentially allows the rich to monopolise the estate market.

They tried selling to move somewhere closer to my sister, and ran into other boomers that were stonewalling for 20k over thebliated asking price because they knew some bank would buy it. Wild times
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't understand how is that possible for a cardboard house, 250k already looks like too much

Not all people have the money or the interest in a law degree, also following supply and demand if you increase the supply of lawyers than the amount of demand then the value or opportunity of that job will decrease. So not everyone can be a lawyer to "Make it " in todays standard.

I'm probably going to make between 100k-200k on this house when I upsize to a better value area. Sure, I've put 5 years and 35k into fixing it up, but still...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ngl imma blame the prices of housing on blackrock, vanguard, and state street.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeahh, then our relatives pressures us --Why don't you make up money to buy your own home now? Why don't you work harder?... Man I hate what the other gens have done, and yes, even some of the earlier generations close to ours have experienced 30k$ to 50k$ home pricing and they got the guts to tell us these.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We already do, in Washington it's a rampant problem in Seattle and it's suburbs, Tacoma, Spokane, etc

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's still happening right now. Properties that were $20K or $40K going up to $250K overnight! They know what they're doing too. They want the property owners to sell due to not affording the property tax anymore.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In the Netherlands a little house is most of the times already 300K 390k and sometimes its already 400K!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not only that! I remember being able to freaking buy a week's worth of groceries (including cold cuts for making open-faced sandwiches for breakfast and decent meat for cooking) with 50 Euros (so yeah: It's not just the US that has trouble with inflation and frankly food-prices are a lot more important than house prices! Yes, being a perpetual renter (especially since rent goes up, too) sucks balls, too but you can make do without owning a home, but you can't make do without being able to afford food)...at them moment 70-80 is the bare minimum for a decent week's worth of food (for one person, as I live alone)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In my country they’re all over 1.2 million in USD

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this is changing, i’m trying to sell my house right now and im real close to being underwater on my mortgage, because prices have come down that much
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1200sqft house with 1 acre for 300k in Kentucky. The sad thing though is that 10 years ago I could have bought a 750k 2025 house for 300k. I don't think buying a house is that unobtainable but it's the fact that unless you're making a quarter million dollars per year you're never going to have more than a small house. I make good money but it feels like that gets you the bare minimum in a decent neighborhood with good schools for your kids. There's just such a big gap between buying A house and buying a nice house.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Covid helped create that massive problem. People fleeing from those blue states into red states and were used to high housing prices. That's part of it. Things haven't been the same since. I'm from Gen X and have been experiencing issues since the 90s. This isn't new. It's just worse than it's ever been. I feel for everyone who's just a hard blue collar worker, barely making it. I'm with you in the struggle.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yep, DECOMODIFY HOUSING. Clearly leaving housing to the markets did not work, and corporate greed cannot be contained. Look into Georgism.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Aligns with increased border crossings... Supply and demand. Demand rose faster than supply.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @nathanboolin you cant blame the feds for printing off the money?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @nathanboolin Yes, fiat currency inflation is to blame, but the question is what are we going to do about it? I for opt out of the system by saving what I have outside of the US dollar and all other fiat.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same should go for apartments because renting is out of control.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 100%. Companies buying up all the properties and selling it on for huge profits 5-10 years later is what's killed purchasing any home near a city or any area with any kind of population for that matter.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: HOA are destroying the U.S.   BlackRock owns almost 50% of all single family homes. They own almost half of the populated country. Let that sink in. These HOAs are far worse than anyone could have ever imagined.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ADJCSee  Blackrock doesn't buy single family homes, they invest into mortgage securities but that is vastly different nor do they own 50% of mortgage securities.  Also corporate ownership of single family homes is around 5%.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: blame them government for given them such power in the first place
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly. And on top of that no one needs more than one house, these people hoard homes for vacation use once a year and remain vacant for the rest…it’s terrible
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Used to build pre-fabricated homes single story homes now it’s super big like bro start small end up big
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Houses are always built and selled by the private companies or corporations themselves, and some by wealthy individuals; government-built houses are fewer, and that's probably better because of the competition to buy the cheapest one.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For the most part it’s not big corporations that are buying houses. They are actually net sellers of houses. The big holders of houses are individual or small scale investors trying to make it rich. I have some academic articles if you’re interested in reading on it ❤

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a teenager myself, I'm surprised how teenagers today aware about the world and the current political state but I guess we don't call it The Age of Information for nothing. Lwk I feel a bit bad that kids start to worry about their future because of the political state, that really says a lot about uncertainty of governance
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @hit.knight5553  i mean, while our governance competency is shaky at best, governing itself is dealing with chaos & uncertainty as best as we can. & while kids are doing it earlier & earlier nowadays, it's not like teenagers never feared for their future, even way back in 1521, they just worried about the salvation of their soul instead of their profession.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @hit.knight5553 just so you know, any time in history when a society reaches the point it becomes an information society, it collapses within a few decades.   A recent example the British empire. They had a collapse in the 70s and they fell off the world stage. Now it’s the USA’s turn.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: dont listen to them. they WANT to limit you and they want you to fit into the system. you CAN do it! dont ever stop pushing for it, dont stop educating yourself, i promise it is achievable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeah that's around the age I started noticing how bad things really are BUT: try to live as best as YOU can. and tbh: even tho it is highly unlikely your sister could become an astronaut: there still is a chance. Always hold onto hope. Keep it at the center. stay positive. and optimistic even if the world is not. usually things happen for a reason so just try to go with the flow. you will find your place in life dw.  also stay opened minded to really everything as much as possible (not dr*gs and stuff) (just knowledge and exploration of yourself). Idk what im on about. rly when I hear about younger teens commenting I try to list advice relevant to what they commented about and stuff that could help. You and your sister got this! stay strong and motivated!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: while your going to get advice from a lot of people (go into trades, stay out of credit cards) i might give strange advice: don't tie your sense of self worth to productivity. this is harder than it seems, but this means you will have a high self worth & strong sense of self, no matter how hard you work or how easy you take it. so many people are restless, unable to rest for fear of looking "soft".  in another way, it is really important to be realistic, but what is actually realistic? most people think they have an answer, but we never thought as a species that moving to a celestial body was "realistic". also, it's really important to find out the hidden upsides & downsides of things early, ask uncomfortable questions & foster life long curiosity. also, try as many things as you can while resting to protect against burnout. most people find a pattern & stick with it, even though time & again it's shown that people who relearn will ALWAYS do better.   get good & persistent at relearning & your future will be evergreen, no matter what your situation ends up being  (yes, even if your homeless theres things to relearn.)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I turned 14 recently, every year is a year closer to severe debt and im scared.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I know ur young but take my advice get into a trade like electrical or hvac. Its hard work but these trades are hurting so so bad for employees that the pay is through the roof for something you don't need experience or an education for.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @The_Trippyish good idea! I’m pretty sure there’s a program opening up for my specified hands on learning for the career you choose in high school, I could probably sign up
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @The_Trippyish  if its not saturated by the time theyre older sure. but even then trades is just one option. a shit one imo opinion cuz ur trading your health in but the pay at the current time isnt bad
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Get into trades, college and uni are a deadend. Luckily I live in a country where college tuition for the school I went to is about $136 per semester but it was a deadend still.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also check out degree programs there are companies, schools, and randos who love to pay for others to go to school, keep your grades up, head straight, and you will be fine.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You're lucky if they don't just get rid of all (almost) the jobs with "ai" and robots,  then make being homeless illegal and your stuff everyone into jail, everything's been going towards that direction for decades and it's been getting faster and faster, could be 5 years from now could be 50, but the people in power want it that way and the politics how to change fast enough while we still have the ability to do it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jaykoerner Seems like a good way for them to get a french style revolution.  If they were to get rid of almost all of the jobs then make it illegal to be homeless while having no way for people to have a home then you’re just asking to be assassinated or worse.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 18 and in the Air Force, and am for the most part relying on the military as structure in my life. The retirement is good and the health benefits are very good but I’m terrified of how expensive it will be to live after I leave the service.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I can't recommend that you post your age online (if you're not an adult, that is), but... I do feel somewhat responsible for the younger generations even if I'm only a 21-year-old Gen Z myself.   Hopefully, we'll at least have a solid plan to figure this out by the time most of you graduate. Gen Z has been the generation to defy expectations all across the world, and we most certainly have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well, realistically it's true about the astronaut thing, just because of how hard it is
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @augusto1126 Oh, yeah, definitely, but I wanted to be a computer scientist and be a programmer, and I went to like 1 year of college and decided it wasn't for me. This was like 2023 so I'm glad I didn't finish because I'd have four times the student loans and still be working as a wagie.  Hoping to start piloting lessons with my neighbor soon, it'll hopefully be years before AI takes over flying.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah I don't know what your financial situation looks like so it depends, but I would say all that matters is that you be smart about what you're getting into when you look in from the outside. If a college degree is really want you want, that is definitely possible. Just make sure you pick something that is both fulfilling and realistic when it comes to job opportunity and earnings such as engineering or nursing, which are both great fields that give you a very valuable degree in only four years of school, with the highest returns. Community college can be a great resource. You can do half of your school there for way cheaper and come out with the same degree. If college isn't what you're looking for then the trades are very lucrative right now depending on where you live. You can go to school for 2 years or less and come out with a better job than some college graduates. Don't lose hope. Trust me I was in the same position as you growing up when I was just entering high school dreaming about what I wanted to do in the world. Now I'm 18 getting my degree in Optical Engineering, likely coming out debt free. As individuals the best we can do is stay smart and stay vigilant.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m so sorry for you guys man… I’m 25. It’s extremely difficult. Please don’t give up! The only way out of this is far right politics man. We need nationalism, we need to take the country back into our hands! We will win eventually!!

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey man, I'm 24 and I just wanna tell ya as a Gen Z, keep your chin up, we'll try our damn best to help you guys out unlike the previous generations.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this is why you build actual nursing homes: it is a classic case of the dictator's incentive.  If people need to aquire power to live in a nursing home, they will do so at any cost. But if everyone can live in a nursing home, no one needs to fear for their late life, and people can calm down to the point that people only desire power because they think they'd be a good leader.  :P

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @kadager569 I made this profile pic cuz I needed something “cyberpunk-ie” and the next week Luigi happened lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@kadager569 it's not capitalism.  It's corporatism. Stop falling for red bait.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I mean, America is quite literally the definition of a “boring dystopia” so it fits 100%
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Played the game for the first time a few weeks ago I almost immediately noticed how on the head they nailed the whole corporate capitalist dystopian not so distant future
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @StancedHellcat not distant..its very near

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: we DO have amazing tech to numb the pain: cell phones with internet for social media!  but because theyre so commonplace we see them as ordinary. if you describe an internet connected phone to anyone before 2005 they would think we have magic tablets
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Online use to be an escape now it's another control variable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Interdacted  as long as they can't control us, online will never be a control variable
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: idk, our tech is pretty incredible. We have computers in our pockets capable of precise geolocation that can access the totality of human knowledge, translate conversations live, and interpret the contents of a photograph. We have computer systems that can understand plain speech and reply in a human manner. We have watches that can read your heart rate, sweat levels, body temperature, and sleep cycles. We have autonomous aerial robots that can deliver products to your front door in minutes. We have mostly-functional self-driving vehicles. We have VR systems capable of tracking every movement of your body.  We live in the Cyberpunk future. The only thing we're really missing is cybernetics, but that's only because their not actually useful in the real world. Remember, even in the world of Cyberpunk, those with implants need to be constantly taking immunosuppressors and antibiotics to keep their bodies from rejecting the machinery inside of them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No cool chrome, just dystopian corporate bullshit 😞
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Probably why I can't get into the game fully, bought it after playing the trail tutorial section, as soon as I hit the open world and did a few missions I stopped. Probably because satirical takes on real life are only so funny until they're harsh realities themselves.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I tried telling people this and they said "But in cyberpunk the corporations control tech" and go into really weird explanations about how we have it better, but then I retaliated with "Yeah, but atleast in cyberpunk I could be a cyborg Spiderman"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @DomTheSub_VT do corporations not control all the tech in real life though?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We have it just not available to the public. Only way is to know how the stuff works.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Seeing these videos just reminds me of how the whole “america is a first world country” is a whole ass myth.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SOoshi_art  I mean that’s a dumb take regardless dude. We are first world. I agree America sucks right now and has for a long time. But I’m not gonna go and truly believe we aren’t first world😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: closer to Elysium (2013) movie honestly same thing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You mean the game made by a large company that released an unfinished game and crunched their employees
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @R0seW00D01  I mean the fictional world it's set in? Clearly that wasn't obvious enough for you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: thats what alcohol is for. And THAT is why the soviet union was famous for drunks and vodka.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I literally thought the same lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: there is tech to numb the pain, slop short form content
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The tech will only make the pain worse. Don't less flashiness distract you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So the funny thing is that there's a Cyberpunk 2020 TTRPG where corporations have way too much power which leads to terrible quality of life outside of the corporations and they end up going to war against one another, and yk 2020 was 5 years ago
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Pan_Highlighter I like the cut of your jib, even got a crown so the peasants know they place!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: been telling my friend since it came out how our worlds turning to cyberpunk— and each year it’s even more true…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @milesgordy6389  I agree in a lot of ways. One detail that comes to mind is how all culture, language, fashion, etc. Is just warped into one jumbled up new one that’s a mix of them all sloppily at once combined. Like in bladerunner.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Kinda disagree on the cool tech, i mean have you played modded VR skyrim?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got laid off last month. Out of nowhere, my manager was happy, everything was fine, but last quartal came out red, so...  Ironically, I got my hands on Cyberpunk this month, wanted to play it sooner but now that I have more free time, might as well, right? Kinda not the best game to play when you are depressed over corporations kicking people in the crotch.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: bring me my cybernetics, ill be a dreadnought. Ill fix the hellscape, for democracy!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was even researching brain dances the other day and have found out that it's not only plausible but we are already messing in that field.   Neuralink is one of the things making headway in research on that field.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: While using amazing tech everyday…… and remember 2025 in cyber punk looked quite similar to our time period now and in 2077 its going to similar as well at our pace
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well Cyberpunk 2077 has an "old internet network" that has "rogue AIs"... Guess what we are building today  Cyberpunk 2077 isn't a sci-fi... it is a documentary
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @hanzcraftcz  I find your name weirdly intriguing. What's the story behind it?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And without the acceptance of being queer
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: want cyberpunk? You can go find it in China
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @victorgoh4719  That propaganda of their robots is all bullshit lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is probably not the most ethical and may be something you already know, but genuinely if it won’t impact your ability to do a job I think it’s okay the fudge details as much as you feasibly can. Like obviously don’t go so far as like some big complicated lie, but if you have like literally anything that can be remotely spun in a way that’s relevant, exaggerate the relevance
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That’s outdated, it’s now ‘boss makes three dollars, I make one penny’
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @judgemental9253  maybe that's why my coworkers are on fenti (this is a joke i do not have any coworkers on fenti afaik, it just rhymed)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @judgemental9253  still outdated boss makes 5$ i make 1/10 of a cent
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @judgemental9253 that's outdated, "boss makes four dollars, I make a penny!"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I wish I had it that good. Making a dime for every dollar your boss makes would make you a multi millionaire
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Today boss makes $400 and you make a dime
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @HamguyBacon  I get the sentiment, but if CEO makes 400x lowest employee, then it would be $40 to a dime.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Boss makes a dollar, I make a cent, that’s why I’m in the street because I cannot pay rent 😊
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i think its closer to "boss makes $10, i make 1/10 of a penny"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you’re good at something, never do it for free
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Or this one, "Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime, that's why I crank my hog on company time"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Average CEO pay in US is over $400k. They're making more than a dollar, and youre not even making 10 cents
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i think the best way to pit this is that “boss makes $4, i make a penny”. $4 is 400x more than a penny
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fax I will never go to the bathroom on a break because of this 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I can tell you have never owned a business,  or you wouldn't be so ignorant
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: More like "boss makes a dollar, I make a dime, if I shit on company time the boss will fire me and I'll be blacklisted from every similar company in the area"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: literally this, I would LOVE to be apart of a community that takes care of each other but most every interaction I have its a competition and I HAVE to think about how can I profit from this situation. I don't want to play their game anymore.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it's all about "that sounds like a good investment" instead of "that's sounds like the decent thing to do"   Toxic hustle culture.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You just captured the essence of bankhazar thought.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yes collective is seriously important humanity will never be Kardashev 1 if we think of ourselves and our families not the state

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @thetapheonix  another misunderstood commenter 😔

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @matthoon3737 but has it really?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sorry to break the news, but morality has never existed. Survival of the genes that replicate the most is the law that governs everything in biology, including economy

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Leguim15 morality is a biological advantage. It allowed us to form communities and thrive. The idea that humans have alway been hyper individualistic and is just our biology is propaganda.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: dont profit, dont be selfish, any profit is literally evil and you MUST sacrifice for the collective or else you are Hitler
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @whenyoucantfindaname  top tier rage bait, i'll give it a 6/10 for creativity
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​ @whenyoucantfindaname  profit isn't inherently evil, selfishness isn't inherently evil. Selfish actions don't always taking from someone, good things can come with them after all. For example bringing your crush gifts so that you can get their intention, it's a selfish intent, but you gave someone something.  Besides what even is this collective you speak of? For all we know it's just some mastermind painting their goals, as the collective's goals, instead of the people.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @whenyoucantfindaname 100%  AAAAGREE. Light it up like it's 1917
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a hiring manager, HR can be stupid. They often list the “nice to haves” as hard “requirements” and then offer a salary closer to entry level than senior. As a result, there’s this skewed system where the hiring manager knows they don’t have the budget to get the senior and will happily take an experienced person with promise but can’t find them because HR is being stupid.  Meanwhile HR will argue to offer more. But your budget is your budget; you don’t set that, senior leadership does. But senior leadership will argue to stop being picky. But you don’t set the requirements, HR does. You see the problem?  I currently have senior leadership arguing against promoting one of my team who not only  exceeds the HR minimum reqs for their position but the next pay grade too! But their argument is we don’t have the budget to compensate that person. Meanwhile I have a more senior person underperforming but HR doesn’t want to demote them because they far exceed the minimum requirements (in tens of skill, experience, and education) 😂   Don’t try to make it make sense; the only way to understand it is that large employers are being pulled in too many different directions and see themselves confused about what they are doing.  I wouldn’t say “LIE” on the application; if you straight up lie, I will not hire you; but stretch the truth creatively as far as you possibly can. For example my entry level positions require 2 years of experience—ENTRY LEVEL, 2 years.. you understand how stupid that is right? We don’t pay top dollar, we ARE the place you go for entry level experience lol! But thing is, it never says it has to be “PAID” experience; the people I hire show me how they’ve gotten that experience in unpaid ways like personal projects, volunteer ones, etc.  Don’t lie; but do look for creative ways to leverage ALL of your experience. For example, I’ve seen D&D Dungeon Masters convincingly argue that they’ve developed group management skills, among many others, for playing a game.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @theronald2350  can you give other examples of unpaid experience you've seen/heard when hiring? simply curious, seeing as i play/have played/will play a lot of games and i believe some skills could be taken in/out from them
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @theronald2350 dungeon master here and yes we have :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Is firing the HR department possible? sounds like the problem would be solved, if the ones who don't want to do their jobs are removed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thats when you lie to avoid the auto rejection, thats what I had to do to get $20k+ salary increase and then exceeded all expectations after being  hired. If its something you know you can easily learn within day or two, just lie
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It takes about a week to get good at pizzas.  I did it for a year.  Not rocket science.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How do we do this but not have a gigantic government. And useless administration, that gets crazy money?

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Dude. Go to the fucking shop and bring your resume by hand. If that doesn’t work go to the one literally 2 blocks down the road
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Funnyhandle1  This may work. But I'm not looking to just get any job at any cost. I'm looking for something with health care and other benefits at or better than my current job as well as something that pays more than my current job. I can understand this from the “I need a job” aspect but there are other things at play. Also this was back  when I worked in fast food. But going in and handing someone your resume unless they needed someone right now did nothing. There was no system to do anything with them. I watched lower level managers take them and just throw them away before anyone who could hire you saw it. I don't think everywhere is like this. And this was a while ago but it wouldn't shock me if it's still happening. I've also seen people get told to just apply online.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bc they are kid. I am sorry for that. Train. Get strong. The plane will crash, we will need tough, capable people in the aftermath.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Genuinely sad comment bro. When I was your age (26), I genuinely still had optimism about the future and was able to only care about my friends a school, not the fucking state of the economy. A little after the time I graduated (2017) everything started disintegrating.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 24 here. We're all in the same boat. Just know for the future that us olders have your backs, and while it will be a lot of shitty work to fix all this, we will try together.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 34, licensed professional engineer with a MS degree, learn from our collective deprogramming and enter adulthood appreciating the power of unions and organization. Nobody gets to more than a couple million USD in net worth without ruining the lives of others, especially the employees they underpay. Those are the true enemy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 23 and let me just say to you,  Good times create weak men Weak men create hard times Hard times create Good men Good men create Good times  We are just in a point right now where everything is pretty much about to implode on itself very soon and when that happens we can create better times for the future and hopefully people stay educated enough to not let it happen again, because it blows my mind how World War 2 isn't even 100 years old and we are already seeing the US government and in particular, MAGA act in the same manner that Nazi Germany did that totally ruined Germany. They will unfortunately have to learn the hard way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @venmon9613   I'll agree with everything but the MAGA part  Respectfully, if you think any single political group is the issue, then you're part of the problem. Kamala wouldn't have done anything, neither would biden or whoever.   They all work for the same system that does nothing but screw us over, and all this "left vs right" bullcrap is just theatrics to keep us hating each other so we can't rise against them. That's why they're all huge hypocrites who shift their views depending on what's popular (Trump said the economy works better under Democrats, Joe biden and Obama didn't like gay marriage/illegal immigration until they were presidents.)   The more we play "left vs right", the less stuff we get done. If we just didn't think in left vs right and instead though Up vs down, we'd be in a better place.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: " John McCarthy, the father of AI, said AI was made to reduce work days/hours, not to reduce the number of people that work, which speaks volumes of what is happening."  We all understand that the slack could go both ways, and that the world would have its impulse in the direction that it does. John McCarthy shouldn't be surprised.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: AI is a scapegoat. They could pay people good wages if they wanted to. They simply don't.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm calling out the channel Shawzy for ai produced videos, makes the same "Voice on top of gameplay" videos as these, same thumbnail logic, uses "It's not just X, it's XYZ" metaphors constantly and her comment responses on her older videos often use an M dash.  If "her" voice isn't ai as well at the very least is a heavily ai assisted channel
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: like what happened with the cotton gin.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Every technological revolution to do with productivity was touted to do the same thing, let people work less, but every time it has just meant more work can be done in the same hours.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey, that's what happened with the cotton gin! Wild that history repeated itself when we didn't learn from it! (I'm just generally salty)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: same thing happened with the gatling gun btw, the creator wanted to have 2 people in a field shooting bullets at each other
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Remember, almost all technological advances are to make work easier. Americans were fighting for 4 day work weeks and 4 HOUR work days in the 1920s.   We can’t let capitalists oppress us.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@OwenTaylor-z7sscientists are so much more important than politicians, good on you. Me personally, if I was president, id like my cabinet full of scientists and experts rather than idiotic politicians.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Okay I’m gonna set you straight again sir. America was never and has never been a democracy. We’re a federal constitutional republic. No where in our founding documents did the founders put the term democracy. This is the problem with the educational system. They don’t teach the truth. And they don’t teach true life skills. 90% of what you learn you’ll never use
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @justinclemons9100 it doesn't matter what the founding fathers intended, democracy is the best form of government. The founding fathers weren't all knowing saints, but they were smart enough to know that about themselves. They why they included a framework to change the constitution
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Gen Z History student wanting to run for office I agree
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: System's rigged. Every president has been related to King John except Martin Van Buren.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Ouranos369 I better check my genetics rq, I want to run for some type of office one day. Probably state representative or governor if I could pick.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Ouranos369  That's more of a fluke of genetics than evidence of a conspiracy. Due to how genetics works, every single person on earth is roughly equivalent to being 6th cousins with every other random unrelated person on earth. It's basically impossible for any two random human beings to be less related than that. Besides, genes matter - it's no surprise that an overperforming chunk of genes would appear again and again among overperforming individuals of history.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Literally same here brother gonna try the same thing, run for your district rep work on campaigns that’s what I’m gonna try to do this summer
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wouldn't it be interesting then that a group of Gen Xers and Millennial men saw this coming and developed a memetic virus that could reach and breach the hearts of all young men against the one thing they hold dearest that those in power use to control men?  That would be interesting. Like an entire generation taking the red pill.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Keep your mouth shut and your nose clean. As Nick Fuentes says, hide your power level.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you get into office, you absolutely need to advocate for regulations that restrict large rental companies from buying so many damn houses. That’s a direct issue where I live. There is 3 large rental companies in a college city of 60,000 people and since it’s a college town they are constantly out bidding regular home buyers and turning the houses into college housing and grossly overcharging on rent. I would not be surprised if they’re all in cahoots
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@Adm1ralPound this is exactly what I've been thinking about as of late. My neighborhood has been victim to this exact issue, with one man buying up the houses every time someone moves out. Every year I see more and more of my home turned into overpriced rentals, and it is really the sole factor responsible for our housing crisis
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As someone who also hopes to run for office one day, I'd support you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m in the same boat as you. I’m at a T14 law school, and at first, mostly out of escapism, I thought I wanted to chase big law, make good money, and just live comfortably. But I’ve realized I want real change. So I’m using every opportunity this school gives me to put myself in a position to actually make a difference.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same, I might go for elected office later in life, as I’m super pissed about how both sides handle the issues. But I’m just a college student so I have a long ways to go before getting a chance at running.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hell yeah, gen z as a whole needs to step up and get involved in local politics at the minimum. I have a sinking feeling that voting might not help, but we need to try to avoid the worse options
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "what you're actually made about"................... okay, so who do you blame? Who were you propagandized to blame? Sure, we can all be made about the same thing, but we all blame different people, and sometimes each other. Running for office? Another dimwit vying for office lol.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @jkfr629 easy to be cynical and not actually do anything. The wealthy elite in this country are everyone's enemy. That's not propaganda, it's a fact. The propaganda does everything it can to point away from the real problem in society, consolidation of wealth and power to the top.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You’re wrong sir. Again if wages go up all of everything goes up. You don’t stop to think that companies when people make more money and have more disposable income won’t just raise prices you’re delusional. Also you think you have issues with jobs raising the minimum wage will only cause the lower tier entry jobs to completely disappear and all jobs of any type will require 2-5 years experience and no one just coming in to the job market fresh will be able to be competitive. Once again I reference what’s going on in California with minimum wage being capped by 2027 at 20 an hour all the trouble is causing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you somehow get presidency or a high position, destroy the federal reserve and cut off all ties with Israel

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I want corporations to reinvest into their workers from their supposed company value. Then we’d all be buying houses. Or at least thriving on rent. Imagine if Amazon reinvested its company value back into their base level workers instead of corporate.  You’d have so much more loyalty on that basis alone.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Foreststrike fr, we need to incentivize putting money back into the economy and working class instead of hording it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hello fellow law student! Yes it’s extremely frustrating, especially when you learn how the law should be followed by big corporations vs. the loopholes big corporations are legally allowed to work through 🫩 wish you all the best in running for office!!!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You're exactly the kind of man/woman I want in my circle. I'm a recent engineer grad with an engineering job but I've always seen our country and politics as an environment and a systems and wanted to fix them. I've also worked detailing cars/planes/yachts and the big wigs were always business savvy and law savvy. I always thought protest was a bit funny when in comparison to fighting the system at what we enforce, the law.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i and many others around me are pissed and tired the same, i wish we could all just come together and look at who we are fighting, OURSELVES, some people seem to think that propaganda is something your own country doesn't do.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They're not going to let you run for office, because you're a threat to their plans and power
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As someone who wishes they could run without the hassle of a resume and on paper knowledge i feel this, Can someone want to unequivocally shake things up without the burden of proof, but at the same time in a hypocritical sense, completely abide to a sense of decorum, lawful abiding behaviors and standards and start over with the most emergent means of economic stability and ease of access? Its like an impossible and almost pointless endeavor as being educated feels so pointless as im not able to move any narrative as im easily dismissable, considered not a serious conversation due to my meh standing in life. Im at the point where ill get my hands dirty first, explain later with knowledge. These fascists make me fascist ffs and its heartbreaking and exhausting
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Genuine question, can you with stand not becoming what you hate? I respect you for what you said but don’t forget where you come from or what the rest of us suffer with
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @jakeschwindt7616 tbh, I'm not someone who cares about money, so I don't see that being too much of an issue. Plus, I like to think my religious background is strong enough to guide me to make moral decisions
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jakeschwindt7616 Ive always thought this would be an issue, they get elected, and then lose touch with where they came from due to the change in their lifestyle. Unless we can enact policies that limit the pay of those in office. The only kind of politician that would actively push for policies reducing their own pay, is one for the people. It forces them to live in and understand the poorer class so they can enact other policies that raises the base quality of life. But who would want to run for minimum wage? (not saying they should get paid THAT little) I fear it won’t happen.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The boomers said the same shit back in their day. Look at them, and us, now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i plan to run for president in 2048
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: and before that maybe something more local like DC Mayor
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: U make it sound like its the same people buying more houses, just wanna clarify the statistic is the average age for first time home buyers. Its likely that first time home buyers are on the decline in general, and the first to get priced out were the youngest bc of all the reasons in the video, thus moving the average upwards to the 40 year olds who have been saving up for 20 years to buy their first home.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Dumbledork1337  thank you for clarifying this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Dumbledork1337  still it’s the average age for first time buyers. It doesn’t mean the same people buying the houses but it absolutely means that the older generations are much wealthier and that the our generation is broke. It means young people aren’t buying houses.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Dumbledork1337  has the right of it. I was 30 when I got my home in 2020, and that was right before the prices skyrocketed, I only did it by not only saving for 10 years but having both my parents and my sister assist me in purchasing the damn place :S (mortgage payments are still cheaper than rent for a smaller place).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im almost 30 and nowhere near buying one. Just by having a child, the child care alone at my extra income, not including the coat of a child already.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In 2005 no 20 year old was buying a home.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You can only be a first time home buyer once
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The average age has changed in large part because as millennials are getting older, we're finally able to buy homes. I'm 37 and am only now able to start just getting ready to buying a house.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: my parents still think its the norm to move out at 18. im 23, stuck at home due to mental health
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The fact that I am born in 2005 is frying my own brain .

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Zergslayer_42069 Ah yes, Europe with all It's social program's, nationalized key industries, progressive policies, & lack of corruption is totally the same as the Hyper Capitalist, Flawed Democracy of the United States.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @52Legendand my favourite, double negative progress.   And then, separation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, bud.  The reason one side is zero progress is because half the country constantly votes for the negative progress side and they gridlock the system all the time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @aaronyayger democrats have had plenty of times and opportunities to make things better, they’ve been in power for majority of the 21st century
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @aaronyayger The sooner everyone realizes that neither party has your interests in mind, the better.  If there is to ever be any real change, it's to get the dinosaurs out of power.  The problem is, the Democrats want to be socialist, which won't work, and the Republicans want to keep doing everything like it's 1925, not 2025, which obviously also hasn't worked.  We need someone else with a different game plan because both of these suck 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Zero progress=Democrats  Negative progress=Republicans
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Both sides are money laundering
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Is it though? Because one side did manage to give us a step towards universal healthcare, even if they gave us a weaker version to cater towards lobbyists and an attempt to compromise with Republicans. I'm not sure how that can be reasonably called zero progress.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's true sadly. Embrace Christ and buckle up Future Wasteland Kings! ✝️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You just described pretty much every 1st world country in the world. You think the U.S. is the only country that you can vote in or something?😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hockeystick of human progress and innovations started when america recognized intellectual property and rewarded people for their ideas instead of keeping them isolated in fear of some leader's repercussions.   If you appreciate being alive after a slight illness and... literally everything which separates us from the medieval ages, thank America.  Most "progress" in history came from here.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s all the same evil. It’s negative progress regardless
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: we lost all the progress after ww2
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Negative progress would be a positive at this point.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So, if you live in New York City, which is where the jobs are located, but the job market is shit, then are you really living where the jobs are located? Bad logic there.  Minimum wage laws are irrelevant. Don't take jobs that don't provide a "livable wage." Stop blaming corporations. Blame your actions.  Go to the blue collar job market and work your ass off. Your chances of success are FAR BETTER than in the white collar market. College is an overinflated scam, anyways. Or join the military.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Was democrats really 0 progress though? I feel like we were a bit impatient. Progress might have been slow but I don’t believe it was 0, we were at the top of ALL countries and inflation was only bad because of covid.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Literally sums up US politics for over the past 50yrs
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ironically, negative progress is the better option here, as the majority of people (working class) will get tired of this and riot, and revolt and start a revolution (like in Nepal)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The Dems are a corporate party, presented as the defacto labor party. We need a real labor party.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Zero-tu9zd  ​ @Zero-tu9zd  Looks at  Life expectancy and Happiness graphs Well.. This data says otherwise, Imagine if there was more to the world than some numbers in your pocket...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Zero-tu9zd making money is the end all be all? i used to live in costa rica and made enough for essentials. I plan on moving back in old age as i literally had no worries, worked, then came home to the beach and it was so much more fulfilling and sustainable than living in my dorm in the states
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Zero-tu9zd  If I'm in the same room as Elon musk then sure, the average wealth of the room is 250 billion dollars, but that doesn't mean I walk out of that room a billionaire. Ask yourself of you weight a possibly higher wage more than free healthcare, paid paternity leave, more national holidays, better workers rights, big strong unions for workers protections, safe schools and streets, free education (some countries like Denmark pays you to study so you can pay rent and food), and depending on where you live and what tax bracket you're apart of in America, you're already paying the same amount of taxes as most European countries.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think millennials figured it out just fine, but older generations STILL have not given up their positions of power. Average age of a US House Rep is 57.5 years, and Senators are an average of 64.7 years.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @cosmic_jon   that part. this shit isn't a gen z thing dude. it's basically all the generations after babyboomer. Millennials BEEN KNEW this shit was fucked up
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @cosmic_jon they will never give up power willingly
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @cosmic_jon millenials and gen z should pass a bill for voting max age even when they themselves are 60 above
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The saddest thing about the millennials is that they intuitively knew the system was fucked but they took the corporate blue pill sold to them by the media. They had the right suspicions but their ‘solutions’ only served to help corporate interests
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @oreodepup  bro get your idealist ass outta here. tf were they supposed to do just be homeless? is that what you're going to do? not get a job to take a stand? get kicked out of your parents house. live on the streets in protest? like grow tf up they didnt "take" the blue pill they were force fed it with threats of homelessness and starvation by lack of change in politicians.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @oreodepup and I was super pissed trying to warn people about it when I was 22 in 2016
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as millennials we let Gen z down is how I feel. we been knowing this but our generation didn't do anything. about it. our politicians been in power since the late 80s til now
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How could americans sit there and watch herbert walker bush talk about nwo on t.v. and not care.... Then his son is president during 9/11, wow shocker
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: At the very least, some older generation people are recognizing our situation and trying to help. There are elders out there who care, and very occasionally someone who has the power to do something about it cares too.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We're all in it together. Yes Gen Z seems to be the focus of it but how awesome would it be if everyone started to do the stuff to fix it, you guys deserve better just like we do. And so does every other generation, we wont just make it better for us but for everyone.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennials and Z have to work together.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah i'm going to stop you right there, what did you vote for.  Did you vote for illegal workers?  did you vote for people who never gave a damn about us?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also a millennial.  Things were looking up for a while, then in 2016 we elected Trump so I knew it was going to get worse.  Then covid happened a few years later and we speed ran the destruction of America.  And THEN WE ELECTED TRUMP AGAIN.  You can't make this shit up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: didnt think id ever see political and cultural talks over minecraft gameplay

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I had, word for word, the same thought
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's a visual hook to keep you watching.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's a propaganda video for the left so ofc it's trying to be relatable to Gen z
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @joual9299  yeah, ok boomer. you have a good day
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @joual9299  broskie, we litteraly just went over that its NOT, this is a side-less discussion about the current issues and how to fix them TOGETHER.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @joual9299 How's it propaganda? How is it politically affiliated propaganda? Seems like you're the only one politicizing it, because as an American word for word this video resonated with me. We're paid pennies compared to what our parents or grandparents were making at the the time, mortgages weren't a long term debt slavery, groceries use to be healthy and affordable! A full time job could pay for a family home, groceries, a vehicle, ect. It's not propaganda, our generation was absolutely fucked
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nailed it with this video, I am so frustrated, angry, and burned out, and I'm only 23. I have spent well over the past year looking for a job but have nothing to show for it, I've only ever even been able to apply to ONE because every other opportunity that I could have potentially gotten into required experience for ENTRY level and would have auto denied me. Now part of my issue is where I live, I'm in one of the worst states to work in and live in a pretty rural area, so I am at a huge disadvantage there, but still, the fact there has only been one job that I could apply to where I wouldn't have been auto denied or ran around in circles then denied is absolutely insane. I am also angry because I made the decision not to go to college with incomplete and inaccurate information about the impact that would have on my life, and now that decision has possibly screwed me for the rest of my life. I had been told that if I just work hard and go through entry level jobs and worked my way up the corporate ladder, that I would be fine, even without a college degree, which that turned out to be the biggest lie I've ever been told in my life, and that is saying something considering a lot of the understanding I had about how the world worked was just completely false, and I have only learned that in the past 3-4 years because of the reality check I have been getting from trying to find a job. I have tried talking to my boomer mother about this, but she is so disconnected from how things work now that I can't even have a productive conversation with her because every suggestion she makes is something I have either already tried or is so outdated I would get laughed out of any place I tried to apply too. I just want a decent paying job where I can live relatively comfortably and not be scared that if I have some sort of emergency, medical or otherwise, I could be on the street the next month, I don't feel like that is to much to ask for. I'm not asking to be handed everything or given everything, I'm not asking to be given special treatment, I'm not asking for it to be easy, I am more then willing to work hard to get to that point, but I don't even have the opportunity to try and work towards that point, I feel like I am trying to push a boulder up a cliff while I have another boulder strapped to my back and 5 people pulling against me as I try to push.   "I'm tired boss"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Whenever I serve an older, rude, rich person at my job, I wonder why I continue to serve the generation that destroyed our nation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My favorite movie from Pixar was Bugs Life, and there was a message that has withstood the test of time. "Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one, and if they figure that out there goes our way of life! It's not about food. It's about keeping those ants in line." - Hopper, Villain that ensI@ved and was going to st@rve an entire ant colony under the guise of food paid for protection.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I somehow always end up watching politics on accident. I know more about American politics than my own country's politics
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i think someone needs to make a video kind of like this about gen alpha, they have millennial parents who just dump all their problems onto them and then when they go on the internet its just people making fun of them for being “ipad kids” or “sephora kids”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a millennial. I'm rooting for you guys. Don't listen to us, we have no idea what's happening. Find out for yourself and barge through the generational baracades, with justifiable anger. The political power is pandering to the old, simply because of declining birthrates and a growing older demographic, voting for their own interests.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: if raising the minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour would cause inflation. then wages falling should cause Deflation. wages have been stagnant since the 90s, and inflation is still rising.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i agree but watching you build this nether portal is filling me with rage
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Then corporations blame everyone expect themselves.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its such a breath of fresh air to have someone who doesn't spend all their time lamenting about our problems but actually has an action plan to figure out how to improve things, Bravo!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Watch my mom deny all this when I send this to her  No arguing about whos got it worse in the replies gang 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Lately, I've been telling people that Gen Z needs to be unapologetic about their interests and demands in political spaces. I know of a couple of Gen Z folks aspiring to be politicians, but interacting with them hasn't filled me with confidence. They're regurgitating the same (or slightly modified) talking points from the Old Guard, but what is needed are people that are advocates for Gen Z first cause that's what Gen Z people need. We inherit the country, the party, and its future. The Old Guard will eventually die off, not living the consequences of their actions.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Old GenX guy here.  I'm struggling too but at least I have a house.  I feel horrible for the younger generation.  The American dream has been stolen from you and they're actively inventing new punches and kicks to hit you with while you're on the ground.  It's nearly impossible for your generation and it's disgusting.  I've been in IT for 35 years and have worked my way up to a pretty good salary, yet I still have to Uber on the side to keep up with my massive debt.  It's mostly college debt from helping my kid, medical debt and home repair / car repair for emergencies.  Now I'm on the job hunt because I was part of the October mass layoffs.  25 years then just gone in one quick zoom meeting.  All during record profit times.  If I don't get something equivalent pretty soon I will have to sell my house. I love this video.  You are spot on!  Fight the fight and change the system.  Please!   These old farts in politics, (Except Bernie Sanders)  don't even see you as human.  You are nothing but crops to them.  I would love to see an entire congress and senate filled with Gen Z and millennials.  That's the only thing that's going to change anything.  Even if it works against my favor, I had my time.  I want my sons to be OK.  If I run out of money and end up homeless I'll just eat a bullet.  My kids are grown, my job is done.  I'm fine.  I'll do it with a smile and my middle finger up.  I will not be a parasite to society like the greedy boomers still voting in droves to take as much as they can from the younger generation when they have no more useful purpose.  I tell them to stop telling their grandkids they love them because they obviously don't.  If I can no longer contribute to society then I don't need to be here anymore.  Compare us to Norway.  The GDP per capita is almost identical to ours yet instead of having a national debt of $109,000 per capita, they have a national surplus of $340,000 per capita and free healthcare, free college, free retirement funding, free childcare.  That's how much we've been robbed.  The people of Norway are happy because they have almost nothing to worry about.  We have nothing but worry.  Good luck my man!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "I dont want to sound ageist." Why not? You know what is ageist? Thats right, biology. We don't live forever, yet these people act like they will.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Building that nether portal was painful to watch
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't think you mentioned that almost every company in the US is illegally posting jobs that don't exist. Meaning they post job listings for positions they don't need to fill. Just sitting there collecting tons of candidates and never actually hiring anyone. It is illegal but of course they use the loophole "well we are always expanding". If you don't have a physical position to fill, the job ad should not exist. Companies should be fined higher than the yearly salary of that position if they are caught.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I never write comments on youtube videos, this is an exeption. The fact that not a single ad ran this video tells me everything about the author that i need to know. I appretiate you sharing real problems and solutions, heres to hoping more people wake up and reclaim the power of citizenship.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: you know, the boomers will go down in history as the biggest failed generation,  they had it, the life we all dream about, and just sold it.  voting for people who build the idea of giving the rich money it would work it way down to normal people. and instead of just letting people build their own wealth. the gave it away to corps that ran everything into the ground.  and now we cant stop it, the corps own the governments. we went from gold to doo doo.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Idk man I’m going to college right now, and I feel like it was a mistake to take on this unnecessary debt, but I also get that without a degree I basically have no shot (but I’m also competing against everyone else with a degree so what are my chances?). Either way you go, it’s not worth it. I really wish I could give positive advice, but I’m genuinely starting to give up on the future myself. I’m really preparing for the next depression to hit because of how strapped for cash everyone is.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @justinbuddy56  Yeah, it feels like a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. Everything that gives you enough to just survive requires a degree but you are competing with so many other people the chances feel next to zero, which makes the degree feel like a waste of time. The biggest reason I had decided not to go was because of the debt, but now I can't find any work, even just basic level stuff so its like what do I even do. Makes it worse when I hear some old boomer start ranting about how my generation "doesn't want to work anymore" and I'm like, its not that no one wants to work, its that no one can because the barrier to entry is so fucking high that no one can get past it. Sorry, I don't mean to be doomer, I wish I could give positive advice too, but I just can't think of any based of how things have been going. I honestly believe we are already in the beginnings of a depression, many are just in denial because of what it means.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I know ur not gonna wanna hear this, but in times like these, joining the military is the best thing you can do. You are guaranteed a place to live (for free), a place to get free food, guaranteed income, and a job from anywhere between 4 years all the way to 40+, depending on how long you want to stay in.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: just be rude back. who cares if they come back..we are all literally just waiting for their generation to die off
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: then they cry "respect ur elders" when they get the treatment they deserve

Gen alpha is still baby sucking on rubix cubes, and gen z is barely old enough to work and holds basically no political positions other than people who make political content.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: All art is inspired from nature meaning the art of bugs life was probably inspired by what the future was heading towards at the time...just my guess
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My favorite thing about the delivery of that line is when Hopper screams about how they’ll lose “our way of life” for just a moment you can hear the fear and anger in his voice as he describes exploitation of the common man as “a way of life” as if he knows it’s wrong but doesn’t care and is only concerned about the consequences.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @bumblegoot1139  the reason for that is because of he doesnt keep the grasshoppers fed, they will turn in to locust and end up killing themselves and everyone else.

Inflation is basically: People have more money, they're willing to spend more money. Deflation is basically: People have less money, they're willing to spend less money.  So the reason why wages have stagnated while inflation has grown, is because the money that should be going into your wages is being funneled into someone else's pockets, and they're spending it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @darkmatter9643  Hmmm, I wonder how... remind me of every type of tax we have to pay again?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly it's just a lie these corporations tell us so we won't pressure our politicians into making policies that change them while they then turn around and do the exact same thing through lobbying. It's disgusting and it should be illegal.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s more complicated than that, there are other factors that impact inflation, but I do agree with you that our wages aren’t keeping up with the current inflation rate.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @DonkeyKong-ic1ou  i know it more complicated. its more of a Response to the simplistic thinking of 'higher pay = higher cost' of thinking. in reality higher pay stimulates GDP growth by and Increases Demand on goods and services. which would influence Producers to Produce more product for the given demand, leading to perhaps higher prices on the short term but would otherwise level back out and Prices lower once more when the demand is supplied meet back at a new Equilibrium with Higher GDP(which is good for the economy). but obviously the CEOs would normally pocket these profits themselves, unless laws (or Unions) are in place to ensure workers get a living wage from the profits they generate. the thing is around 22 dollars an hour should be the Minimum wage if the minimum wage kept up with inflation. since it had not increased it means the CEO basically Pocketed the Difference and YOU as a worker are Charging less for the Labor you sell the boss year after year(this goes everyone is if they don't get an annual Raise that at least = the current inflation rate).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @DonkeyKong-ic1ou  the inflation we are facing now is mostly the after math of Covid interrupting the supply chain giving Corporations an escape goat that they can blame allowing them to hike up prices (called Greedflation), when in Reality supply chains are fixed and the Federal Reserve Banks had Restricted interest Rates inorder to Decrease the Real Inflation rate from 11% in 2020, down to 2.3% in October of 2024. most of the High Prices right now are from Price gouging, since most people are told inflation is High right now people expect to see higher prices... business take advantage of this to charge more knowing people will still pay it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @DonkeyKong-ic1ou the primary reason the wages aren't keeping up with inflation is because corporations have completely taken control of our government and our politicians are allowing them to do whatever they want walk through lobbying which should be illegal.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Inflation is nothing more than the expansion of the supply of currency. That’s why it’s called inflation. Literally just stopping the printing of money today would end it instantly. If you don’t believe me just look up Milton Friedman who’s a way smarter guy than me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Reducing wages does not cause deflation, theoretically it should. In reality it does not
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m in Econ and much of what I learned is that they stopped prioritizing the social and focused solely on private. There’s a group of people who decide these things we don’t get a say on what they think is “more” important
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Raising the minimum wage doesn't cause inflation, it's caused by government spending especially when we're in debt, companies don't raise wages because they need to make a profit, otherwise they go bankrupt and then no one has a job.  Wages are the last thing to rise when there's inflation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Deflation isn't good just because it's the opposite of inflation, it's still bad but for different reasons.  What's good for an economy is monetary stability.  As far as minimum wage goes, monetary inflation isn't the issue so much as value of labor.  Yes, costs for goods and services will rise as a side effect, but also when the value of labor is artificially inflated, the demand for the labor will diminish.  In other words, many employers if, say, were suddenly required to double the wages of their workers, will simply lay half of them off and give the remaining workers twice as much work to do in the same timeframe. Companies do this all the time for other reasons, such as a decline in profits, so anyone would be naive to think they wouldn't in this case as well, because it too would effect their bottom line.  I know for a fact that a prior job I had at a company that made layoffs after a bad year didn't replace anyone and just dumped the workload on the people that stayed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This... is not how money works. Blame our fiat currency and detachment from the gold standard, as well as our money printing for our inflation problems (we print money to pay government debt).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is why letting the government control the market was a bad idea government regulation always makes shit more expensive
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @SilverWaterSoc07 exactly. I hate when other Gen Z people say "Look, the government regulations have fucked us!" and in the next breath beg for more government regulations and market control to try and benefit themselves.   Why have cars gotten so expensive? Government safety and efficency mandates. Why are houses so expensive? Government limitations and regulations concerning building codes, zoning laws, and material use. Why is college so expensive? Government subsidies and grants to students, increasing access and inflating demand.  They clamor for more government with every election and wonder why nothing changes and continues to get worse.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: First, it's true wages haven't kept up with inflation or the cost of living. That said...   The system is designed to keep inflating. The Fed just prefers the steady 2%.  Also, did you see what happened in 2018 when New York went to a $15 minimum wage? Car washes couldn't afford to pay workers that much, so they automated.  People became 'black market' car washers, working for cash.  Recently, California went to a $20 minimum wage, and many fast food workers and delivery drivers lost their jobs.  You can say that's greed, but if companies can't make a profit, they will go out of business.   If it's cheaper to automate, they will. Now we have outsourced food deliveries to Uber, and drive thru's now are done by AI.  And if you say they are lying or just want higher profits, what then?  I want higher wages. People need it.  I also don't want only large corporations to be able to exist because only they can afford to pay people a livable wage, which is what minimum wage was intended to be.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @specialrobot71 In Arizona we have a $14.70 minimum wage and car washes are being built near most major intersections. Ny just has terrible companies running the car washes over there I guess.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @s @specialrobot71 hey can afford to pay. I live in Maryland which raised their minimum a few years ago to $15 and small businesses didn’t just suddenly collapse.   These businesses “existed” or fired people bc of greed not necessity. This country has dogshit protection for workers rights, and if we had strong unions or workers councils it can prevent this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@specialrobot71 If a company can't run while paying a living wage then it needs to adapt or it shouldn't exist.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That’s not how it works. The inflation is because the government print money out of thin air.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @thetapheonix  the government does not print money out of thin air, the Federal Banks do, which are independent from the Government. they can also make money vanish into thin air as well... its pretty interesting to think about, they literally just go into a Bank's bank account and add or subtract money to the end of the balance and boom money just vanishes or appears, it makes you think more about how real money even is. but i don't know what you mean by how 'it' works... what is the 'it' you refer too its hard to have a debate if i dont even know what your referring to...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wages haven't fallen, though. Real median personal income has grown by 43.62% since 1990.  Also, the minimum wage only causes inflation in sectors where the typical wage substantially increases as a result. Likewise, deflation would follow the same logic.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @anakinjames92  first I'm talking about minimum wage, and it did indeed go down in 'VALUE' you must account for Inflation since the 1990s. on average the Inflation rate had been around 2% to 4% every year since the 90s. that means the amount of money you hold loses 2% to 4% of its value.. if you had been saving 100 dollars, 2 dollars  each year might as well have disappeared. and if you did not get a raise at all that year your pay is now 2% to 4% less because it buys you less
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it "causes" inflation. it's actually just companies raising prices the second they have an excuse, and pretending they had to. regulating costs, say, with government funded public alternatives so that people were ALWAYS able to boycott unreasonable company practices, would drastically reduce this problem :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @pixiedustsoup how does it NOT cause inflation? If you increase the price of labor, you increase the price of goods. And why would the government want to help you in that situation? Your taxes are based on your income, not your expenses, so the government will take more of your paycheck away before you even see it in your pocket...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The govt spending money is the only entity that can cause inflation. The same reason a house that costed 100k is 350k.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Dk_the_Sage  Inflation is the Value of money Decreasing. when there is a Bigger pool of money in existence because the Federal Reserves makes more money. then compared to the supply of all the goods within the economy the dollar becomes less Valuable thus the Products that you buy increase in price because they are now more Valuable compared to the dollars you use to buy them. the government spending money on whatever does not increase the number of existing dollar bills within the economy, because those dollars are collected Via taxes... they are already 'IN' the economy, the Government does to just pull that money out of thin air. only the Federal Bank can do that, and the they are Independent from the government.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fines do not work.  Bank of America has been fined to the tune of billions of dollars. It makes money hand-over-fist casually breaking the law as it likes.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ZeroNumerous  Fines do work. The only reason they don't work right now is because our politicians have been lobbyed so hard in our corrupt government so they are often cheaper than they should be. If a company can get away with dumping waste incorrectly but incur a fine cheaper than disposing waste properly, they will 100% without a doubt do it improperly and pay the fine, for the "cost of doing business". If we charged them correctly, by charging them more money than it would cost them to do the right thing. Fines would certainly work. That is why each illegal job posting should cost higher than a years salary of said job per posting. It would cost them more than paying a employee for a year which I think is adequate damage for them to get their act straight.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​​ @lemonscentedgames3641  I'm figuring from affordability issues in large part ? (Like heaven's sakes at least guarantee parents paid parental leave each and job security in the course of that. If the choice is not having a kid vs one of you giving up their job or both of you being overworked to hell and needing cash for a nanny (or have very available family you trust) ....)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's a multitude of factors, as others have pointed out, not just toxic work culture (same in Japan though). Turns out when you demonize families, view kids as parasites of time and money, and pit men and women against each other over first world issues, birth rates decline. Who coulda thunk it...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Funny (in a sad way) it dropped to 0.68
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's absolutely true. I'm also a Korean student, and AI is making the job market even narrower, yet when I see parents who still force their kids to study nonstop, I can’t help but sigh. Blind, unconditional studying only turns people into slaves of society. And honestly, the older generation in Korea is several times more rigid than the older generation in the U.S
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There's a couple of factors that contribute to Korea's birthrate problem, but yes, time and money is probably the number one reason. In terms of productivity, South Korea is not even as productive as some other countries that work less with smaller populations and higher GDPs. A lot of Koreans loiter at the office long after their work hours are over, and a lot of the times you're pressured into spending almost every waking hour with your coworkers and boss, even spending late night dinners with them.  Koreans are tired of overworking, of studying themselves to the bone, of forced conscription, of wage inequality, of sexist views that expect women to stay in the home, of all the jobs moving and staying in the big cities, of chaebols controlling their politics... it's just a very sad situation.

The era that birthed the middle class that everyone bemoans about disappearing.   Boomers are the grandchildren of people who ushered in the progressive era.   We, the grand children of Boomers, will have to usher in a new progressive era.   Hopefully our grandchildren are not the next boomers. Assuming we have kids.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @heavenlysenju9948  there are also far more boomers than there are billionaires. The trillion dollar wealth transfer away from the working class isn't because of an entire generation, but because of a much smaller group of very wealthy people and corporations. What's headcount for the richest of the rich nowadays? 5000 and a bit? Same as the gilded age. They've vastly outnumbered. Sure, lots of people got absolutely scammed for the past 60 years to abandon socialism and union strength, but the working class still outnumbers the richest of the rich.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: in fairness they are a product of their parents parenting, and their parents were traumatized WW2 veterans who grew up in the great depression, there was no guides on how to do things and they didn't teach the boomers to appreciate things, not hating on anyone but rather just being realistic with how things played out
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jimbothegymbro7086  I think that's fair. I am not a zoomer but I have noticed that most zoomers I meet are less callous and more introspective, I always put it down to them being further away from WW2 trauma than the 3 gens above them. I get you get some utterly sociopathic zoomers broadcasting their insanity online now but pathological people are in every generation, and we had the shock jocks on TV 30 years ago.  Can't say I personally will excuse the boomers collectively though, there is some high grade selfishness running through a group who really don't have that many excuses given the economic leverage they had and still do have today.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What kills me is that I was raised with the tried and true mentality that you should respect your elders, and in MOST countries, in MOST time periods in history this is actually genuinely good to teach people. We SHOULD care for our elders and those who have lived full lives because they SHOULD be beacons of wisdom within communities. You look at several countries in Europe and Asia, and elderly people know that they are not the driving force of their societies but they try to actively help and teach the next generation, especially the youngest one's what wisdom they are able to share. In the U.S.? It's like the complete opposite, the entitlement/mentality of a lot of elderly people seem to be that they are faultless but deserve the utmost respect. That they can be tumors within families but should be the tip of the spear for it. It genuinely baffles me exactly how sociopathic the boomer generation is, they are such a unique anomaly for human history that it is like a glitch in the matrix. My concern, is that because of them and their antics it's going to garner a lot of apathy for older people in general even after they have passed because of how horribly they have damaged the country. Whenever I have kids I'm still going to teach them to respect their elders in general, but because of boomers it has become legitimately difficult to trust anyone of that age bracket because of their insanity. When that generation passes, I genuinely believe they will be remembered as the worst generation of people to have ever existed at least in US history.

They've proven they'll bend the knee whenever it serves them besides a select few, we NEED a new party for the people, and the way Gen Z is ending up I'm cautiously excited to see new hotblooded politicians who want change
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly it is time for a revolution
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Here’s the problem. If all workers get laid off, then they get no money. So they can’t buy anything from those companies. Which means the companies get no money. So these companies are literally killing themselves.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That’s so tragic thank god for mass migration it really helps out these poor victimized governments
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @TauPathfinder334  So actually the governments did try mass migration, but doing so fucked up the serfdom system and almost ended feudalism all together. Then they tried paying the peasants, because they couldn't fall back on the old worker/owner relationships.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s weirdly ironic, but true, that the Black Death actually improved quality of life for most Europeans in the decades that followed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Unfortunetly black death had 2 outcomes: helped to triger shift towards capitalism (due to sudden change in allowing peasants to move freely in search for work), but also while there was not enough workforce this allowed people to demand higher wages and move to places where better wages were offered..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also most the people who died were elderly or children only the healthiest workers survived and thus the explosion in wealth.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i read this in trumps voice for some reason and it was funny at first till i realized trump doesnt know a single thing from any part of history (except  copying Reagan's campaign solo. I guess the 80s were a good time for a virulently racist new york real-estate "mogul" (too stupid to be any sort of mogul) even the most basic hypotheticals and such immediately loose their comedic value with him because he's so stupid and incapable, making it so that all you really can do is call him stupid and incapable. but he just keeps failing upwards, a tool for his, at least half-smart, real billionaire friends
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And of course you hate the wealthy people that were willing to take advantage of the Somalians right? Not the Somalians who just wanted anything better than what they have I'm sure. Especially since those rich people want to replace everyone with AI
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If migrants had protections then employers couldn’t take advantage of them and would have to pay everyone fairly. But it required fewer braincells to be racist I guess
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Unironically we need a real plague to cull the population for exactly that reason preferrably one with a severe age differential in mortality. Plus just in general we need something to cull the weak periodically abundance is killing more of us than nature ever could

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @GodOfOrphans  If you are suggesting this idea surely you're okay with being a victim too? Cause I know I don't want to be considered weak by whatever standards you go by and I'm sure the countless other people the same as me want to either.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @GodOfOrphans  With that username your idea seems pretty on brand, lol.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Here's the issue: respect your elders used to be a good idea because back then, your elders knew more skills than you and if they said "hey, your forge isn't set up right" then that was important advice. Now it's flipped, because they might be the best woodcarver in town, but they don't know their ass from a hole in the ground when it comes to effective googling, AI poisoning, or all the other tech stuff we need to know in modern life. And even then, like with everyone, only learn from them what they know, not what they think. Learn football from the football man, learn chess from the chess man, don't learn politics from either of them, and definitely don't learn politics from the actor man
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My dad hasn’t worked since I was 5 , some of the meanest people I know are obsessed with “respect your elders” it makes tolerable easy going but low paying jobs annoying lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Word I work with people but we have like a senior program thing like they come to us to take classes but the amount of old people that are so entitled. I’ve given them all the Gen Z stare because their grumpy ass face isn’t helping
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like it would be better to treat the elderly with respect, but only if they are actually worthy of it.  There's obviously a baseline respect you show to people, generally. But, if they show themselves to be stupid, corrupt, entitled brats, then they should get no respect. Generally, old people are fairly nice, but that doesn't mean everyone is. And having to deal with an elder that was a shitty narcissists', its really shown me just how much respect is earned, not entitled to.  So, if they're as bad as the old people in politics, with some exceptions (Bernie), don't show them respect. Unless their actions in fighting for you back up what they say, they deserve none of it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s so sad. I’m so freakin stressed. I’m gonna soon be in this. About to graduate high school, and I’m so concerned on what the hell to do.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's the same in Europe, it's not only a US thing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a brit, I will say that yeah, mostly true. Old people in our country are usually quite nice and sweet, however, presidentially? Nah, not as bad as people in America no, but still awful.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I wonder if everyone makes businesses would we lost profits due to no more demand for customers since everyone is trying to make money
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@TayyJayyThat's been observed more than a century ago, the system has a tendancy for profit rate to fall. In a competitive market, businesses are forced to cut down on costs like lowering wages, automation, outsourcing resources and labor, all to ensure their product is cheaper than their competitor.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is the trajectory of capitalism every single time it has and will be tried. You must outcompete the opposition and if they are willing to play dirty they will win, so you are incentivized to do so as well.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You gotta pay the entry fee for a better job, eg college, certifications, experience. And then you have to compete with people who will work for less than you will. And if you’re the lowest bidder and get the job, congratulations! You now work for a bunch of psychopaths.   But I’m not just sit here and whine, we can always just start a business and pay ourselves with our own effort either freelancing our skills or providing a product, which is ironically these days one of the most reliable forms of income. Go fishing! Sell to your local restaurants! But that comes with an entry fee too. Rod, reel, cooler, bait
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Problem is a lot of people think they should be payed more than what their work is for. Like minimum wage is for 16,17 year old working after school or weekends, you want more money then get a better job (Now im not saying every job is paid fairly but you should rely on minimum wage to live, you should get a decent job)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @TycerKirk  A good chunk of the video istalking about how even "good jobs" dont pay enough now, you cant drop out of school in grade 9 and work at a Big 3 auto plant and make enough money to support a family of 4. that just doesnt exist, even going to school (post secondary for like 50x what it cost 40 years ago) doesnt guarantee a "well paying" job,
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @TycerKirk   And who is supposed to run those places during School Hours?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The solution is not just to steal that stuff your parents were lucky enough to get though as most people here are hoping for.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There aren't greener pastures out there anymore. The grass gets to be greener where you water it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In detail, our economies produced firms way bigger to their own health, and filtered into politics, this for something that makes sense to them, which is rent seeking, I mean, firms are working as intended, they should seek rent, the problem is the political frame on which the market is being sustained, the market frame should encourage competitiveness forcing firms to create wealth to seek rent.   But that has gone backwards since this big fishs went into politics themselves, and confused the masses into thinking that market freedom means a competitive market, which is not always true, as we can see right now, and we must take it by the neck and put it down where it belongs, into wealth creation and innovation, not into "finance engineering".  Am i suggesting to break market freedoms? Yes, Does this means we need to go political? Yes, Is this communism? No is a wise government restructuring of society which can work, history has precedent, the new deal, Does this get rid of capitalism? No, China is literally doing this as well and is going beautiful for them and denying is dumb at this point, the difference is that WE CAN KEEP OUR FREEDOM, and our DEMOCRACY.  And finally, Could this create a crash?  - Yes, and we are all already broke now so who cares anyways
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​ @samu_2822 your closing remark is beautiful
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @samu_2822  isn't the AI bubble and generally barely papered over recession set up for a crash sometime anyway? (Regarding the last bit on causing a crash ... plus those have been cyclical every 2-ish decades in US-style capitalism anyway)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @samu_2822  Your idea would put more power into the government and take away from individual freedoms, they want us to compromise more and more until we have nothing left, the reality is there will always be corruption and greed. Eventually there will be the day when you people give up the Declaration of Independence from cause of manufactured societal and economic issues, and that will be the day you sell the country to the enemy, because you never truly understood who your enemy was and what they wanted to take from you. They want to completely own you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly that practically where my life is at now and im 18
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Earth-To-Zan we cannot. Have you seen the United States Army? Maybe some would help us, but their loyalty is to those in their family and those in charge, not to anyone else. The revolt would die, screaming, and forcibly be forgotten because those in charge don’t want anyone figuring out that we did, and that our message was exactly what the country needed to be. So that’s why we can’t. So instead of repeating yourself, think it through, do research, then reply more informed than you’ve ever been.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is an interesting idea I’ve never thought of. Do you have an insta I can ask you about this?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's conservative propaganda, social security can easily be funded by removing the cap on taxing income higher than $176K
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Plutonix_5  there's a lot of clamis on how to not make it collapse, but no action. The current state of things amounts to theft.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Real. This is the worst thing about the EU, you're taxed to death because of some stupid social system that is certain to collapse before you're old enough to use it. So you'll forever be taxed nearly 50% of your income for absolutely nothing. At least in America the taxes aren't this bad and even before tax you're earning way more than in Europe. Americans don't have it as bad as it seems, housing costs are the same or more expensive in the EU than in America, necessities such as electricity, fuel, heating and gas are also cheaper in America, all that while you're earning barely half of what the same job would earn you in the US.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Jobs are hard right now mate, I was an electrician, and I couldn’t afford to go to work since my boss refused to increase my wages despite me working for them for 5+years, even though I started from the bottom again I’ve gotten an Apprenticeship position for a Michelins restaurant (what also pays better and ibdon’t need to work 5-5 every day and I don’t need to travel 3+ hours a day anymore ) , and I got that because I knew someone, but before that I went through 2000+ job applications

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @kazkanyoucan-00 you are genuinely delusional. Born broke die broke. That’s how this country and most others work. Lying to yourself time and time again only makes it more and more painful and hopeless every time you get crushed because you had the audacity to think things could get better.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: fuck the party system, we just need americans representing americans, not suits and silver-spoon fed cowards representing corporations. the party system creates a divide that cannot be salvaged, because it starts the mentality of "us vs them". It's the exact reason the founding fathers didn't fucking want a goddamn party system, but for lack of a better option at that time, had to implement it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @KnightofDark00180  I totally agree man, the party system really is destroying our country and will probably begin a civil war. It was a terrible idea from the beginning and the effects of it are shown so much clearer today when both parties are at each others throats. And what you end up with is the bullshit going on today. America should only have one party, the America First party because the two party system was the first crack in the ever growing cracking of America today.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @KnightofDark00180  Y'all should read up on the wheel before you try reinventing the wheel. You guys don't know your history, and it shows. Anger without the context is knowledge is destructive, not constructive. Your anger requires the knowledge needed to focus it properly and productively.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @KnightofDark00180 your statement is historically inaccurate. Many of the founding fathers wanted political parties and political parties existed during the revolutionary war, the tories and whigs. Tories were loyal to the crown and whigs to the revolution. These parties existed at the continental congress as well. Many founding fathers wanted washington to rule indefinitely, but he stepped down after 2 terms to set precedent that presidents only lead for two terms. After washington leads for 2 terms the first election is between the federalists and democratic republicans, the first parties that formed in 1790s. Unfortunately I believe that political parties are inevitable as people will always have agreements and disagreements in their ideology, and certain people’s philosophies tend to align in a way that makes some people their political allies and others political opponents.

There are politicians who care. Thr issue is the old facts still want to maintain power in the most damaging way possible so we see parties like reform spring up whosmt were the brexit party of the past.  At this point if we don't get green in 2029 I am genuinly going to have a generational crashout.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @glowtail3744  Yes, but a very real problem with the green party is that they do not care if they cause green poverty in the Southwest.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @glowtail3744  as a brit i completely agree
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We are never going to get anywhere if we don’t drop the “us vs them” mentality. Saying that one party is the reason this country is suffering goes against the solution of this issue. If we spent more time actually trying to understand each other instead of bitching about “DeMoCRaTS” or “RePuBlIcAnS”, we  would be more likely to reach a consensus on what we should do as a country. Furthermore, using either party as an insult doesn’t help anything or change an opinion, all it does is cause us to turn on each other
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Singleoxygengg I suppose I'll get rid of the 'us vs. them' mentality for when I face off against a wolf or tiger in the wild as well and see how it goes. See, this mentality wasn't our own idea - it was forced on this generation. It IS a fight for survival, it IS us vs. them. The sooner we realize this, the sooner change can occur.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What I’ve noticed is that none of their policies actually have any impact on America except gun control.

I was there early and I've got decent experience for my age, but he just drove off without a second thought. This is the stuff we deal with. It feels like the older generation is always on our backs, acting like everything was so easy for them. Sure, they had their own challenges, but it’s different now. We're really struggling and instead of support, we often get criticism. We shouldn’t be mad at each other; we should be aiming our frustration at the government and the systems that have let us down.

My parents thought i was being, 'lazy' until I showed them three months of job applications. I broke down the spreadsheet by workplace, hiring manager ( if available), their phone number, email, and how I had applied. Results were colour-coded, and summarized at the top; 283 jobs applied, 8 generic decline emails, 2 interviews, 1 minimum wage RETAIL job. I have five years of hands on IT experience, and $800 worth certifications...  Several of my  gen Z friends from a variety of fields have been laid off in the last year alone. My brother (24) was laid off in the automotive industry, and it took him six months to find another minimum wage retail job. It all feels so helpless at the moment.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think we all need to acknowledge who our enemy is.   I'm not sure if you'll see or respond to this but the current state of Israel is behind almost all of the problems we see today.   Who owns all of these rich corporations? Who controls our media?

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: do capitalists even have a place to escape to after the next crash?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hope that the 2030s will at least be a near-renaissance for the global economy. Of course, it won't be a miracle, but just as the 90s recovered after the economic disaster of the 70s and 80s, it's possible that world recover after the disaster of the 2020s.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What a hopeful perspective which can only be described as a dream. Contemporary economics indicates that a nuclear confrontation between the United States and Russia could erupt with little warning. Moreover, the rapid expansion of digital identification systems suggests to some observers a trajectory toward unprecedented global centralization—namely, the consolidation of economic structures under a singular international banking authority, accompanied by the emergence of a unified governmental framework and even a homogenized global belief system. Within this interpretation, current equity markets seem profoundly overinflated, sustained in part by what is perceived as the continual creation of trillions in new currency by elite institutions. Such practices, critics argue, risk precipitating not merely a localized recession but a systemic and potentially worldwide economic collapse. This in retrospect is primarily a result of biblical eschatological prophesy which namely marks the ending of the second primary dispensation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You may be right sir. I just like to keep a positive outlook on things I guess. Assuming we will meet a nuclear end is depressing. Hopefully this isn't our reality.  @Vezvein

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @llamaxrider you may leave the us, the us doesn’t leave you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ey man. I know that’ll be hard but you gotta live to. I think the best thing to do is expatriate. That’s already what I probably will do to.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly, the best advice I got for you is to do it yourself and see if your willing to live in despite said problems of said country. Visit the country, live temporary an few days if your passport is strong.   Look up the world happiness index + Human development index with inequality fixed. Use these two metrics and your own personality. Find what visa you need to reach said country. Easiest way honestly is by business or  be rich lol.   And lastly, do consider in fact that this world is cruel... meaning that the USA has so much problems but ironically is way ahead then 197 countries. My side of the family is from Spain and we suffer from unemployment and shit, stagnant wages. When they arrive in the usa, they make so much more money in the usa and they mention that it is better financially. Best luck to you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And also, there is some countries that dont do duel citizenship and renounce your passport. Meaning no taxes for uncle sam but also no more american citizenship
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i hope so, but the world is run by the uber wealthy and if the wealthy have one skill, it's not letting go of any power even in death

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You're party correct, it's totalitarianism vs Republicans + old school Dems. Also Trump did address Christians in Nigeria as well as farmers being attacked in South Africa recently, iirc.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Sugondees  doesn’t give af about the Christians he is just looking for an excuse to send the military to Nigeria and get their oil
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Here a few solutions that are proven to solve these issues in the US. Get rid of money in politics. Politicians are not allowed to trade stocks. Not allowed to receive money from corporations for their campaigns.  Do not let corporations buy single family homes. Or maybe allow them. But tax the hell out of them. Make it hurt them.  Another option is put a cap to how many they can buy.   Just those two things will honestly fix so many issues we have in this country. Politicians will actually fight for us and not against us in favor of political donations from the wealthy.  Houses will be more affordable for everyday Americans.  That’s seriously all we need for this country and it will start to heal. This has been proven to work in other countries
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im honestly in such a crisis in my life right now deciding what to do especially since im not able to fully focus on school without the fear of being kicked out due to my relationship with my parents. I either work and weld and hopefully make a liveable wage or focus on school
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s not just zoning laws, CA just rewrote zoning laws to basically destroy the r1 zoning and allow 6 story buildings in single family home neighborhoods and allows ADUs to built across the state. It’s the regulation and permitting process slowing things down. CA has CEQA where you have to pay some environmental fine for building and in my experience building, projects are slowed down ( even for simple adus ) by YEARS waiting for approval by the local permitting office.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Alright, major issue with what you were getting at around 7:23. You literally said that “no, companies won’t hike prices if the minimum wage goes up” and then immediately proceeded to talk about their endless greed. Like no, they would absolutely continue to raise prices. I mean I guess you could make the point that if they’re gonna raise prices anyway, that minimum wage should go up to try and keep pace but then you’re stuck with the infinite inflation machine and that would not be good for anybody. I honestly don’t know what the answer to it is, but I have a strong hunch that blanket raises to minimum wage would compound a lot of the issues we already have
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Another example is how hard it is to get accepted to college but then you get shot in the foot because you still have to pay tuition. Most students devote their time energy, sacrifice their social life, sleep, relationships and actually being a kid to get into a colleges who just turns around and charged them abhorrent amounts of money that most low income students can't pay.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I disagree… As a Gen Z myself, I’ve noticed far too many of us falling for propaganda and ideas just because those ideas are cool. The only reason most of us think we’re ‘aware’ or ‘immune to propaganda’ is because we couldn’t fall for the same propaganda targeted towards Boomers. Now we’re in a new era of propaganda, discreetly seeping into our lives without us realizing it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m from Oklahoma. Spent two years on the east coast, mostly PA DE NJ, and wow are there so many more jobs on the east coast and the legislation/regulation being so pro labor makes working where most jobs are way more comfortable and I was a much more efficient worker. I moved back to OK for family, and it’s changed how I view my home state. Getting a job, and keeping a job here is so much harder, and our employers and managers take advantage of us every day

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In other words: Less government does better than more government. Who knew.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is exactly it. Everyone is always saying that the government needs to change yet won't actually do anything but talk. Talking didn't change those countries. Action did. Also Americans have guns, which can terrify the government. If the entirety of Gen Z bought guns to take over the government, they could totally do such a thing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Until an actual revolution takes place, nothing will change. Things are so broken that voting alone isn't enough anymore. People want change? Then they need to organize and MAKE it happen.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i've been trying to get this point across. There will never be a revolution. Almost every common person in this country wants true socialist reform (even if your a rightist, you still want it) but there will never be a revolt
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is why I don't even want to go into computer science. The market itself is so over-saturated now that it's basically impossible to get a job if you're just starting out. Either you get lucky while in school and land a good internship at some massive company or you're basically screwed. Not to mention, the state I live in is basically the polar opposite of a tech hub. The number of CS jobs in my market is vanishingly small, which just makes the issue even worse. The whole economy here is based around tourism. So, I'd have to move to have any competitive chance.

I have two beater cars that are only a couple years younger than me that get me from point a to point b and I’m 27.

America is no longer the global power that it once was, globalisation has taken that from away from it. Housing affordability is simply catching up to the rest of the developped world. Long lived the greatest nation. In case you were wondering, it's not just Americans feeling the strain, all across the EU we are seeing drastic changes in affordability. The West has begun to collapse, better hold on tight, dark times are on the horizon.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: These houses are literally overvalued. They are simply not worth the price in material and it will come crashing down when people start defaulting on loans and no one rents. Move to a country where realestate is a small part of the economy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @brianburwick  This is the main thing. The actual material/labor cost of building a house does not at all line up with the actual value of the house. They are overly commodified on something that should never be valued as a commodity in the first place. It should be valued as a necessity that people can't live without.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @brianburwick  Corporations survive the crash and buy up homes to recover the market. Also 40% of people own there homes so a collapse wont wont like people think it will.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like Switzerland might not be to good of a representation of Europe because a lot of people move there because of low taxes, so it makes sense why the prises of things are so high, but yeah Europe in general does also have quite a high average first home age, but I don’t think it’s as bad as the US

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My grandmother came from communist Cuba and she used to be so impressed with how well the us maintained itself, she told me how impressed she was when she found no homeless people in sight, and how easy it was to keep a job. She even lied about her qualification in knitting and instead of getting fired, they simply trained her so she can work properly. Nowadays she compares modern society to communism, when she started doing it in from of me I was too young to understand political corruption so I didn't believe her. Now I do, it's just ran by big corporations. "you will own nothing and be happy" really struck fear into me, we're becoming like Cuba. And then on my other side of the family from El salvador which at the time was flooded with gangs. Unlike my cuban grandmother, I don't live with them so I don't know much. However I've heard vague indirect mentions how the government is a democracy but ran by political corruption. Now thinking about it, that sounds familiar. All you have to do is look at other nations with struggling citizens and you'll see our potential future.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I might just be cynical, but I think one of our biggest issues is that most people aren’t even able to comprehend the issues and possible solutions outlined in the video. People are just go to work, get on social media, eat processed food, and go to bed drones. Very good and comprehensive video, a bit on the socialist side for me on some issues, but most of the outlined solutions would be much better than what we’re dealing with now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 15:19 what the fuck is this nether portal you're building??? what are you DOING man xD
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think there's a big point you are missing here. Labor to build a house charges you 10-20x the amount compared to the material required!!! If you can build a house like me and Dad did, even with a half loft or something to peer over to see what people are doing downstairs. That'll be (in 2024 when prices were cheaper) 10 grand. $10,000 is not a lot of money to spend on material alone but you do need an expert to help you and yes... Like me, you could be stuck procrastinating over building it for years. It took 7 straight weeks without rain for me and Dad to successfully build the frames and install a metal roof. You don't want rain during building.

In addition to being the most prioritized thing our country should be funding. - put a limit on how many businesses/properties a corporation is allowed to buyout.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Did y'all know a 2% asset tax could easily replace all federal taxes. You would only pay taxes on your home and stocks if you owned any. That's 0-25000$ for most Americans(bottom 90%) in total federal taxes. That replaces business taxes, payroll taxes, federal gas tax, income tax, unemployment taxes, capital gains taxes, tariffs. Literally all federal taxes gone for a clean simple miniscule asset tax. Most Americans would see 40 percent raises on their paycheck and the average investor would go from 11 percent gains to 9 still pretty healthy profit imo. Oh and businesses pay way less in taxes too it does mean less billionaires though.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's not something that comes up in school, but back in the 1930s FDR gathered the ultra wealthy and made a big speech. The substance of the speech was "If you don't stop fucking the poor so bad, they're going to rise up and kill all of us." In the 30s and 40s the government took steps to establish a floor for how terribly you could be treated, and how badly your community could be manipulated, specifically because they were afraid of a popular uprising. When the tension simmered down as a result of these programs, the government abandoned most of them or cut their funding until they because a joke.

"A house divided against itself cannot stand", as Abraham Lincoln said.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: its not that we’re becoming similar to communism, its that we’re basically just living in authoritarianism at this point. Communist governments are authoritarian as well, so that why theyre similar. however economically the US is the complete OPPOSITE of communism, we’ve reached such an insane level of capitalism that we’ve formed an oligarchic, fascist, authoritarian government
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @annakeshish  will amend that communist governments aren't authoritarian by default (technically authoritarianism in itself is already antithetical to the concept), just most known "communist" states have been authoritarian (and semi-oligarchic and often corrupt) — as the US is demonstrating in full now under a "capitalist" system (the amount of support and subsidies large companies are getting from the US government aren't exactly capitalist either)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @annakeshish  No. The sheer comical levels of regulation utilized to ensure there's no competition is functionally a planned economy. Also, please don't use word salad to describe things. Oligarchy and fascism are diametrically opposed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Pure laissez faire capitalism hasn't existed in this country in probably about a century.  It hasn't existed in the world since Hong Kong was an independent state.  So to say the modern United States resembles communism in some ways isn't too far off.  The main difference is that our government doesn't technically own any of the production, but the similarities are in that basically an oligarchy controls the economy, but rather than a one party political system, it's the whole political system as well as a handful of powerful companies.  It's crony capitalism, it's oligarchy, it's corporatocracy, it's kleptocracy, and it's a surveillance state.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @100percentSNAFU   So basically, "This wasn’t real capitalism, guys." You remind me of those communists who keep repeating, "True communism or socialism never existed; that wasn’t real communism!" It’s the exact same argument: whenever the system produces an outcome you don’t like, you simply declare its "not real" and try to detach it from its practical consequences  "crony capitalism, it's oligarchy, it's corporatocracy, it's kleptocracy..."  You are just describing the end game of what capitalism is about. In the end capital tends to accummulate in a few hands. These are the predictable results of how capitalism operates in the real world.  We’ve seen it repeatedly: as markets mature, wealth and power tend to concentrate in fewer and fewer hands. Regulations get written by the same people who benefit from them. Competition collapses into monopolies or cartels. And eventually, economic influence becomes political influence, turning the entire system into a mechanism that protects and reinforces the interests of those at the top.  So when you cry about "Thats not real capitalism" what you actually mean is "Thats not the idealized version of capitalism i have in mind". Ideals aren’t the same as outcomes. In the end, wealth tends to accummulate and power tends to centralize, the end game looks exactly like the things you are trying to dismiss.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​​ @100percentSNAFU  wasn't famously trust-busting teddy roosevelt US president in the 1900s? Not very laissez-faire of him to intervene like that ( with monopolies that according to our math-based models of economics shouldn't exist to begin with but somehow keep doing so? Can't be that our models are too abstract to be good predictors ). You might need to go back a good bit further than just a century?  Also gotta love that it's embodying all the non-communist parts of the countries that claimed themselves as 'communist' (like at least fund the arts, sports, and provide childcare so the women can work?). Low-key though, don't think you'd need to caveat the single-party thing for the US, especially with how interest groups and wealth have been predictors for legislature passing in the country since at least the 80s to 2000s, with the overall population's preference having next to no predictive power. Just that the single party has two sports teams or dorm houses that like to trade insults every four years (and one has an extra strong flair of fascist overtones).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My family came both from 2 countries who went through communism. China & Cuba.   One side is cuban (Fidel Castro)  & chinese (Mao Zedong)  Another side is chinese Spaniard & Italian   I can tell you that you still can't exactly compared communism and capitalism.   At least with capitalism, you can own  private business to survive and could try your best honesty to earn more money (that is, if you can) and you arent trapped physically in an country like an ton of countries before 1989 and with crazy fucking dictatorship. They don't have National Revolutionary Police Force in which make you stand and guard your neighborhoods either.   But honestly, very damn accurate... we are living in an  hyper capitalist society and it should honesty be the nordic model. Capitalist but with some socialist such as public housing, healthcare, education etc.   You can't be hyper socialist or hyper capalist.  And unfortunately, when most americans never experienced real communism with family or any nordic model they unfortunately think socialist and hyper capitalist is an dream! Until they have family or themselves live it. That is the true horror...

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @artistaccount  sorry for taking so long to reply, I have divorced parents so I had to wait.  Anyway, I've asked my grandmother and I will say that she believes that a specific political party is causing this (which I wont say) She tends to see a lot of censorship happening done by people who've been "indoctornated" (in other words, cancel culture) She belives that a majority of our taxes tend to go to extremely poor people directly, while also saying that politicians are profiting off of this system. And she doesn't like how some people own 2 homes and then it gets taken away by the government (but I'm unaware of a scenario like this happening) and then brought to a group of poor individuals. And she also views welfare apart of the issue.  I should also let you know that because she's disabled, she doesn't go out as often so id imagine most of this would have to be what the news media she watches tells her.  From my perspective the only way I can see her feel some of these oppressive practices is with her knitting business and excessive taxes her and my dad pay.  So anyway make do with that information.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​​​​​​ @artistaccount  I'd wager it's to do with corruption/backroom business dealings, sorta ineffective rule, inability *for normal people to accumulate much of any wealth, lack of resources/quality products to keep things maintained, and rather intense and extra-legal enforcement (which kinda .. comes with needing to learn from scratch how to run and plan a country you've just turned 'communist', the sanctions traditionally combined with that, and a rather tenuous grip on government from being so new .... very much less understandable for a country as sorta old and established as the states)  Also monumental buildings to "the people"/leaders depending on how authoritarian the "communist" country is getting ..?  Would be some of my guesses but OP will likely have more precise things if they can get to responding 😌)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ngl i still dont understand the pushback on socialism
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Goobergobbs just reading the replies its because a lot of ameribrains still just think “socialism=more taxes” they dont actaully know what it is and suggesting to increase taxes on the rich is very unpopular in the US because US citizens think they can all become billionaires with a few lucky breaks
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Goobergobbs  Because of a very simple thought process.  "We should provide a safety net for the less fortunate!" - Okay. Who pays for it? "We raise taxes on the rich to pay for it." - Okay. They leave. Who next? "We tax their assets so they can't just leave." - Okay. They put their assets under a company. A foreign company incorporated in a tax haven. Who next? "We tax foreign companies from [country]." - Won't be passed, our government puts their taxes there. "We tax all foreign companies." - This is called a tariff. It doesn't work either.  Even if we accept that taxing people MORE will somehow work—it doesn't, nor has ever—then we've already seen how the government wastes our tax dollars. And you want to give them MORE? We've already seen how the government fails to implement policies. You want them to add MORE? The system is, by its very nature, broken. Because it relies on a top down approach. Reagonomics did that, and socialists the world over hate him for it. Why would you think the socialist program implemented by the same people would be any more effective?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Goobergobbs  Most modern Western societies practice some socialist policies in order to provide safety nets and a fair shake to the less fortunate, and I don’t entirely disagree with a lot of them. The counter is the more people you have dependent on the government, the less freedom the people have. The logical end point of full blown socialism is authoritarian communism. Some socialist policies in a capitalist society are generally fine and good, I just lean more toward traditional conservatism and individualism rather than collectivism. I also think socialist systems are easily abused and a net negative to the tax payers if not managed correctly, and they’re usually not.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: k here's the deal on socialism: socialism is the public ownership of the means of production. that means that the majority of the population is in a position to contribute to a culture's primary traits: symbols, currency, laws, works of art & literature, agricultural and technological exports, etc.  what WE do is capitalism: the private ownership of those means of production. that means that any person with enough wealth is able to usurp the creation of our culture and decide what is/isn't important to the average person. it's a development of imperialism, wherein the persons who owned the means of production were ordained by assumption of entitlement - rulers who claimed a divine right owned everything & parceled out pieces without actually giving anything up.  socialism is the next step away from imperialism. it's not fascist, as you've been taught, UNLESS a fascist exerts control over it and does not ACTUALLY implement socialism :) freedom of speech/press are one of the things that are a demonstration of socialist ideals! anyone, in theory, can speak or create works that the public considers important cultural artifacts. in practice, though, the majority of the ones that are successful are because they have wealthy investors who have allowed them to create and share their works.  democratic socialism 💚

America needs doctors, engineers, Lawyers, teachers and everything in between to remain the best and strongest country on the planet. A country is only as good as it's people. I'm am from a red state, I have lived and seen what happens when you don't let talented people achieve at home. They go and achieve elsewhere.   The goal is not to have enough money to survive. That's short-sighted and will lead to us falling into servitude and destitution.   Taking care of our fellow man and making sure they're provided for is not only how humans survived up until this point, but also what led to the greatest and most prosperous time in this country.   The problem is that you think it's supposed to come out of your pocket and you know you have nothing more to give. But that's not what we're talking about.   The top 10% own nearly 70% of the wealth. The top 1% own over 40%. These are gilded age numbers. The laissez faire era that was famous for it's corruption. Much like today. And it's what led our forefathers into the "progressive era' in which the middle class was birthed.   THIS IS US. WE ARE IN THE GILDED AGE. WE MUST BRING ABOUT THE PROGRESSIVE ERA OR BECOME SERVANTS TO ELITES.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Free healthcare?  So where are we going to get the doctors that work for free?  Don't understand economics and taxation much, do you?  😂😂😂  Nothing is a "right" that requires the labor of others.  What if nobody wanted to be a doctor?  Then would you force people to be because it's your "right" to medical treatment?  Services aren't rights.  You don't even have the right to a fire department or police protection.  If you live somewhere these services are unavailable, you are on your own.  What's a "livable" wage?  That is a purely subjective term.  Who decides?  You?  A person you agree with politically?  What if someone you disagree with gets in office and changes it?  Is it still a livable wage because they say it is or does it have to be okay with you first?  Who is going to police hiring policies of companies?  You?  Or maybe we create a new branch of law enforcement and raise taxes to pay for it?  But I thought police were bad.  Police should be defunded and we should just have social workers.  But more police is good if it's for something you want?  Ah, yes like when they pull you over and give you a ticket, they are Nazi gestapo.  But if someone walks across a piece of your lawn and disturbs a blade of grass, they should be at your beck and call, right?  I get it.  You can't get a job so it's everyone else's problem and we need a special task force to make it fair for you.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You know the worst part? We nearly had universal healthcare. Corpos lobbied that away.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don’t think fully universal healthcare would work as it would take forever to get an appointment, I’m thinking more towards a national health insurance like they have in Japan where while you do have to pay for healthcare, it’s actually affordable (drug manufacturers can only legally charge 17% over break-even price there, unlike in the US where they can charge hundreds of dollars for something that costs a couple bucks to make)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @keyboardgunner Yeah, a regulated insurance market might be able to achieve a balance between an affordable but quick ability to get medical help.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I can get behind half of this. the other half would only create a whole other problematic system, however. healthcare, as much as I would LOVE it to be free because the prices are INSANE right now, cannot ever be free. if it is free, how do the people working it get money? from the government? because that would only pump the taxes up because now we rely on the government paying them well. if they do, then we get taxed WAY harder. if they don't, you get a lot less workers as the pay is not worth it, and suddenly a basic checkup will almost never happen, because everyone needs medical attention at some point, but it can't be sustained by so few workers- and even an emergent situation gives you a nasty wait time because frankly, not many people want that hard a job for low pay. corpos buying each other out is only a problem if we let ourselves be too reliant. should someone get too many under their belt, we just need to be prepared to do what we must and watch them burn. regulating them only de-incentivizes them doing that, or even growing at all. why try for growth if there's a predetermined limit to what you're allowed to do?  frankly, for all these arguments about "changes" it just leads to another bad mix. there will always be a loophole and things will always get worse if we let people hold power over us. we need to be accountable for ourselves, and not let it fall on people who don't give a shit. that's the real problem.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @danny-d0rito  At some point you have to raise taxes. Either on the wealthy (which would be the most effective option) or possibly on everyone. We need to increase the standard of living across the nation, not just for every individual americans. People having more money in their wallets doesn't stop wealth from syphioning  off to the rich and being circulated in the fake economy, and never reaching back to us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @danny-d0rito   Fun fact: Health insurance works the exact same way as universal healthcare provided by the government except it’s more expensive thanks to the fact that health insurance companies want to make a profit, is less likely to cover healthcare costs thanks to the fact that health insurance companies want to make a profit, doesn’t pay for all of the healthcare costs when they’re forced to cover them because of the fact that health insurance companies want to make a profit, and is just worse in general because of the fact that health insurance companies want to make a profit. Also, the US government has been paying health insurance companies subsidies so that they’ll keep prices low, and that subsidy money comes from taxpayers. Alongside that, it would be more expensive for the US government to keep paying health insurance companies subsidies instead of providing universal healthcare.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Here's the problem: Stocks aren't real money. They're fake money. It's POTENTIAL money.  If you get taxed on a stock, and the stock goes down, do you pay back the taxes that person got taxed for? If no- you're justifying taxing the POTENTIAL EARNINGS of a person. If yes- you're just making it comically easy to game the system.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @ZeroNumerous your not taxing individual stocks your taxing net worth of all assets using an estimation of their average net worth the previous year. Presumably if their net worth goes down they could defer their taxes with interest to avoid selling at a loss it would increase churn in the stock market but businesses would have more liquidity to buy back those assets when needed. it would be annualized with a monthly payment based on said estimations. Obviously there are more details like do you fully tax primary homes, 401ks, t bills. Probably not but 2% is way more than needed already. The system works fine because the selloffs of stock are consistent, annualized, and expected in downturns people can defer or simply sell better performing stocks holding those that may rebound. The only tricky part is estimating net worths which is the easiest part to game/obfuscate. Here's the thing though if a bank is willing to give  low interest loans on stocks and various assets they are tangible enough to tax. Our currency is fiat anyway stocks are not far off it's all presumed value.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Was there not almost a complete state collapse in japan when they raised tax for peasants to 2% of income and people did not tolerate it?

People need to start questioning their corrupt and greedy governments. I'm a millennial and also want to leave the country someday. And the only way I might come back is if all these systems of old, grey, and senile politicians being able to keep their power are abolished permanently. We don't need super pacts, the electoral college, there should be congressional term limits, the people that really should be running need to be far younger, and open minded that are for the people and actually care about our country literally putting everyone else in front of greedy self interests and insider stock trading, which is something that should be limited. Things need to end up more diplomatic instead of ending in an impasse without positive results that benefit everyone. This is how we will solve student loan depts, and how we establish better health insurance, and make houses more affordable with comparable wages to afford said monthly household income and income, and state taxes that don't go to aiding in foreign wars that we don't need to be getting our hands dirty with. Money that could literally be used to help our economy, eliminate poverty, and solve both the drug and homeless crisises. Lastly we should stop voting for one party or the other just because it's traditional. Everyone should start voting for the protest candidate. Someone who thinks outside the box and is actually willing to get stuff done that the Dems and reps aren't going to do. It's time we oust these two gangs of 80 year old children that don't give a crap, not even for their own children or grandchildren and take the country back so we don't look like a joke to the rest of the world.

But what about in the future? The economy is bad, the government is even worse.  These old men in power are stupid — every single one of these people in positions that WILL dictate the future of this country and it's people are STUPID, the population is so hopeless and those who aren't are also egotistical and in a way, STUPID! They stripped the BUDGET of the MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, and guess what? They complain and criticise the young for being stupid?! When the curriculum shifts so much? When the education system fails to cater to students and child's needs, assuming that they're all the same and don't have quirks and problems that any person would have that differentiates them from the rest? I'm not even talking about the job market or the other horrendous aspects of this country! The law is basically dead, the wicked works until they're shriveled into nothing, and the people in power and their families continue to be so lavish and continue to be so indifferent to the struggles of the people — aren't we the same?

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The problem is not that corporations are greedy; their job is literally to make money. The problem is that the political class is too captured by unchecked economic power to use government power to check corporate overreach.   On your point about the minimum wage, here's the paradox. If you raise the minimum wage, you price out entry level positions; especially those that can be automated. There's a reason why grocery stores are replacing cashiers with self checkout. The solution isn't to raise the minimum wage, the solution is to build a new currency.

We had to do the discovery so you gen z's could do better than us... most us millenials will never own a home and we are well into our late 30's. The best we can do is hope to help you guys to save the west... its a shame a damn lot of my generation are dumb though.. makes it hard to push any real change.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is a basic principle of economics. Minimum wage to cost of living ratio often stays the same, regardless of what the minimum wage is. That's partially because company labor costs must be offset by profit, so the higher minimum wage rises, the higher food/retail prices rise in order to meet or hopefully exceed the cost. However, rising cost of goods tends to chase customers away, putting companies in financial crisis and perhaps even closure. This results in more unemployment and less economic activity and competition. So, constantly rising the minimum wage is a terrible and self-defeating policy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not from the US but i see that we have the same problem, basically the fix is political, a lot of our economies have gone backwards and confused themselves to poison itself and going rent hunting which is not wealth production, since we let the big fishs into politics and perverted the ideal of market freedom as market efficiency, which is not always true, specially in mature markets, as we can literally see from the stats right now, the fix is to take the market by the neck and force it competitive once again, even if it means to crash it down, is perverted as of is already, and we are all broke already, even the ones "doing well" so who cares eitherway

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The thing is about Nepal that I would say wouldn't directly transfer to America is that the citizens here including myself have enough little pleasures to delude their minds to not care enough like until everyone is starving and homeless nothing will happen in mass.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @graysonwhitmore4259  Somewhat disagree. Based on the popularity of the No Kings protests earlier in the year, people are willing to get up and protest. Gen Z is also feeling a significantly higher amount of strain than other generations. A Gen Z rebellion will happen much sooner than you'd predict based on a national average for homelessness and affordability. And with affordability only continuing to nosedive, while the job market only gets worse, Gen Z's rapidly realizing the bread and circuses are really just smoke and mirrors. Plus, every time Gen Z overthrows another government (up to like, 7 now I think) America's Gen Z is given another reminder "we could try that" The REAL difference, is that 1/6th of Nepal's population lives in the Kathmandu metropolitan area, and the entire nation is smaller than Illinois. The logistics required to affect change is orders of magnitude smaller.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm not from the USA, but your left is our center here. They made you think that someone saying example: "Uuuuh we are going to give homeless people shelter" is the same as a blinding bright red communist (exageration), when in reality that should be a basic human right. And that's why Bernie, for example,is considered an extremist there, because hes on the left of the total political spectrum.

That's because the rest of the world is HEAVILY influenced by globalists elites that want to make all poor people permanent serfs for them... America is the last stronghold in the world against the globalist elites that have conquered the rest of the world. That's COMMON knowledge.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: an even worse part is that you’ve been convinced that we have a left and a right  the democrats are centrists. at best they keep things exactly how they are. republicans are right wing. they tend to actively roll back progress. we hardly have any left wing people in the government, and that’s kind of the problem? because left wing policies are exactly what we need right now. every topic in this video is a generally left wing policy and that’s no mistake

I'm going home to suffer alongside people who care about me"  In a non-English speaking Western country, I now believe you will NEVER truly assimilate, or be considered an equal if you're linguistically and visually, NOT the majority or midjority.  It seems to make more sense to return to your own tiny game server and playing by the rules you spent the first half of your life learning.  Fund and feed the retirement and future of people who actually like me, than that of people who look at me like I stole something from them (while I beg for a chance to top-up their tax dollars).  My personal decision is not final, because I still want to believe Western countries are not actually dead automatons, but this is what I feel, deeply, while in a good mood.  I think I'd rather be a baron halfway up a tiny hill, than be a slave at the base of a gigantic mountain.

No profiting from land you ain't living OR working on, you either sell it or use it, no empty space allowed because we can't grow more space, inversion will be punished. 2. Companies that have been around for over 30 years are not allowed to have investors, you already know how to work, you don't need investors, any project that you needed extra money had to already been solved, you had 30 years to achieve them, and this includes any CEO and director that has ever worked at the company, it doesn't matter if they only worked there for a single month, you ain't dropping the company and funding a new one to get more investors. Neither will it be allowed to invest in foreign companies that have been around for 30 years, use that money on new businesses that actually need a push.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just let the system die, I'm perfectly fine living in the forest at this point. At least we'll be actually building something.....
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Dude I agree 100% with all the problems you're talking about but not your solutions. Raising the minimum wage would increase inflation tenfold. Building more "affordable" housing sounds good on paper but my governor tried that and its creating so many problems. The endless construction, the traffic jams, the fact that they're upscaled apartments anyway and people from out of state are just gonna move there, not to mention the environmental impacts.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People don’t even know that colleges used to be free like public schools, now they want you to be in debt for your entire life just to get rejected because no one wants someone who is easily replaced by ai, also home costs are increasing because of online services allowing people who aren’t even from your state to buy it, don’t actually fix anything and paint everything gray and sell it like it’s some luxury home when it’s a single wide trailer from the 80s just so they could make some fast money and make the home price and in general local taxes increase because local property value is supposedly better when it’s just a terrible market situation

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As the witch of greed I'd like to say this is not the greed I stand for. Absolutely disgusting to me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Some thoughts:   Solution 1  - Ban people who own more than 2 homes: easy way to free up the market  - Zoning is needed but on its own it a trap solution: there was a recent study in sf that estimated if upzoning happened it would lower rents by just 100 dollars, and thats instantly getting eaten up by inflation. You need rent caps.   - Social housing is illegal to build in the US. Its gotten a bad reputation becouse it was literally sabotaged and there is a law called the faircloth ammendment that actively makes it illegal for the government to build more housing if it increases the housing supply: this makes it so the only options the goverment has are Things that burn the fuck out of taxpayer money. Either paying out of pockets the diffrences in what tenants can afford (section 8 housing vouchers) or investing in low rent properties that eventually convent to at market housing after a set period of time. Leaving up to the market doesnt work becouse most builders are also landlords and they dont want to increase the housing supply enough to affect their bottom line. You need to split those two up  - BIG one is tentants unions. If youre renting you need to join a tenants union to leverage yourself against landlords. And you need to advocate for laws that strengthen tenants unions.  - Highly recommend reading "Abolish Rent by Tracy Rosenthal" it outlines a lot of policies and means to get substantial protections for tentats   Solution 2  - Also enrcurage more worker copratives: go further than profit sharing, people have a right to have a democratic say over their workplace. When people actually have control over the profits and descionsthey make it leads to more resilient, better paid companies. On the ground workers are better at making descions then distant CEOs and like you said: you need to hold to be able to hold people accountable. We need workplace democracy   Solution 3  - Look Up the blog pluralistic by Cory Doctorow it talks about anti trust though the lense of breaking up big tech. Amazing content  Solution 5  - Some good news on that front: in Montana there is a legal battle attempting to bypass citizens united. Its complicated but basically they are attempting to say as entities, corporations shouldnt have the power to spend money on elections period. Something to watch at least  - We also need more accountability for judges. Much of how the Supreme Court operates needs to be restructured so ancient unaccountable people control so much of our laws  - Big thing is ranked choce voting: we need this in the US to get more than just a two party system  Solution 6  - We 100 percent can do free high quality education. Up until Ronald Reagan was the governor, California had free high quality education and it was actively sabotaged. Billionaires dont like a population thats more educated than they need to be and would much rather you take bootcamps they control vs developing critical thinking.  - People should have the right to learn: both for job training but also to learn "lower value" things people are curious about. Thats how you get a more educated, curious population that isnt susceptible to propaganda.   What you can do  - Highly recommend checking out the working  family's party if you want an org thats trying to do good stuff on a local level.  - Gold standard is to actually help build stuff outside the 2 party system. Even if you got a non corprate canidate, their bosses and peers arent and will activly sabatoge their efforts. 3rd parties arent viable yet, but both parties are ultimately beholden to billionaires so IN ADDITION to voting, we need to look into orgs that arent taking money from big doners. Even if its just on the local level to start  - If you want good resources for unionization, especially on short notice: look up the Emergency workplace Organizing Committee (EWOC) . They provide a ton of support. Even if you dont agree with them politically, your local Democratic Socalists of America (DSA) chapter also had a lot of great resources for helping with unionization, you can exploit them for that.  - Great book to look into for how to affect political change is " The Persuaders by Anand Giridharadas" talks a lot about what you can actually do to change people's minds on stuff. Ussaly its available at your local library or for free on libby  - A great way to learn how to be politically active is to think about the issues you care about the most and see how you can organize to create the most viable small scale alternative today. Care about feeding people? Do a food drive. Care about transit? Start a carpool or bike bus. This isnt going to solve the problem wide scale but it gets you with people who care while doing good and restoring hope in yourself and others and building a poltical movement. If you want a great example of this, look up the history of the black panther party in oakland. Get out into your community, listen to their needs (espeshily those who have been neglected) and you can make things less shit now, you dont need to wait eons on politicans   -Dream big too! We need to not just trail other countries we should surpass them. If billionaires are going to fight the fuck out of you for just a 2 percent tax increase, may as well fight for the 90 percent they had post WWII, the time when the middle class was the most prosperous   -Think bigger than your country. Billionares are able to go to other countries for cheaper labor becouse often they scew them over. Supporting efforts for worker orgs abrod helps make both your lives better and fucks over the people screwing you both
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im hoping this never happens, but people need to remember one of their basic rights given by the Constitution: the right to reform, or even REPLACE, the government  if things get bad enough, this is the last resort: a revolution. i'd hate to see something like this happen, but that's where things seem to be heading, so we (as a whole) need to stand up and promote political reform before it's too late to do so

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There was a nation in Europe that implemented your suggestions, at the time they where one of the poorest and most broken countries on earth. Within two years of bringing these policies in they became one of the richest and the most scientifically advaced nations.  Free helathcare, companies invested thier profits into thier workers and the towns they where in. Government set up national factories to keep the unemployed in work and paid. Housing, healthcare and education where considered basic human rights. Massive environmental policy that protected and grew the wild landscapes. Huge incentives to marry and have children, all forgin interests removed from government with a total ban on lobbying.  That nation was 30s Germany.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: He brings up some great points about the democratic system (among other things) in this video but there's a clear left-wing bias here that might negate the point of the video to "unite both wings for progress".
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Alright so first off, yeah. you clocked the problems perfectly. I feel like making a few points though so here goes. -On the use of the term late-stage capitalism (16:00): Capitalism, by its nature, runs off of competition. If a company finds a way to decrease costs, they can decrease prices and outcompete every other company. Because of this, if one company starts treating applicants worse or paying employees less, other companies MUST follow this path in order to compete. Once companies reach the point where they can't actually improve their product or increase efficiency, the only way to grow, a goal demanded by every shareholder, is to treat their (potential) employees worse. Other companies follow, and here we are. So yeah, this isn't greed. any leader who did not make these choices would either be kicked out, or their company would just die. This is what happens in a late stage of capitalism when innovation stops. -On older politicians: It isn't just age. Older politicians like Mcconnell, Trump, Chuck Grassley (R), and Schumer, Biden, Dick Durbin (D), and Angus King (I, caucuses D) have caused more than their fair share of damage to the country and should all be voted out. However, they have and will continue to select younger successors who will vote for the same tried and true 1%-enriching policies, maybe with a new coat of paint ("abundance liberalism" for the dems, outright fascism for the GOP). Candidates like Newsom, Jeffries,  "ex"-CIA agents Abigail Spanberger and Elisa Slotkin, and on the republican side pedophile Matt Gaetz, con man George Santos, and basically the entire House Freedom Caucus exist entirely to hold the current status quo in place for businesses long enough for the people who have profited off of current policies to die and pass on their wealth, tax-free, to their children. Age is not the line between good politicians and bad politicians. I personally like to use PAC donations, or lack thereof, to determine if a candidate might actually make the world a better place, but there are a few warning signs that also work pretty well (the use of the term "working class"(good) vs "middle class"(questionable), opinions on Israel (the establishment of both parties have very entrenched interests here), and basically any involvement in the intelligence sector or high-level military/mercenary work (unless directly addressed and basically apologized for, having worked there is a solid red flag)) 20:27 - just seize them, okay? no need to give these people money for their greed. governments have crazy power. 21:46 - YES. I'm glad you said this, because it's important. means testing costs the government more than it will ever make back. if people are stressing out about not going above a certain income bracket so they don't get kicked out of their homes, you've just moved the stress from the start of their careers to the point where they're finally starting to get a hold on their finances. and rich people won't choose social housing anyway, because it's not a McMansion. 24:29 - fun fact: the primary reason for this decline is a campaign conducted by businesses like GE (and their spokesman/later US president Ronald Reagan) to pit workers against each other by abusing racial and sex divisions within and between unions. Their way of convincing workers to dissolve their unions, among other tactics, was to convince workers not that they would end up better off without them, but that other races would also benefit. moral of the story - do not let anything divide you when class unites you 26:02 - Stock buybacks were made legal by Ronald Reagan. if you're recognizing a pattern here, keep looking. Ronald Reagan is everywhere. 29:17 - for what it's worth, this may be caused by student loans not being forgiven when you go bankrupt (not an argument for this system being good, ofc) 33:51 - much as I think this policy would be a net positive for the US, this is realistically on the citizens. We repeatedly vote for these geriatric politicians. We need desperately to not do that, and younger people have a responsibility to run for office, bring their energy to their campaigns instead of acting as though they're above it, and do everything they can to make the world a better place when they do get in. THIS IS ON US. 35:50 - the entire idea of voter registration, in a country with mass surveillance that has a specific number set for every single citizen in the country, is absolutely absurd. Can you legally vote? you should be registered. 38:20 - You guessed it, this was Ronald Fuckin Reagan again. He basically went to war against the UC (university of california) system when he was governor there (IIRC tuition was totally free in-state), starting a trend toward effectively ending the idea of a public university 50:11 - Parties agree on very little. PEOPLE in those parties often agree on a lot of things. I think this is a pretty important distinction to make, because the parties only really agree on a few issues and every single one of them is bad for us. 52:15 - much as I agree, the vast majority of creators who call themselves independent media are far more dependent on disclosed or undisclosed sponsorships than any legacy news source. Be careful with who you trust and be willing to cut someone off at the drop of a hat if they prove themselves willing to take money from gambling sites, drug/supplement companies, or crypto firms. For every announced sponsorship there are 5 more people paying absurd amounts of money to creators secretly for good coverage.  oh god that's an essay. sorry. Hope you enjoyed, because I absolutely enjoyed this video..

Here's a super simple way to game this system: I found a company, then I create a board of consultants for people to make important vital decisions like voting on the color of our walls—beige or beige. This consultant position is not open to apply, but costs a sum of money to receive a seat. I can have an unlimited number of consultants. I pay out a percentage of profits to everyone who is in these consultant positions.  ...Wow, I've recreated investing with zero effort. Like what the heck are you even saying here?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ZeroNumerous  1. doesn't have to steal or kill anyone, just make it prohibitively expensive to hoard the land.  2. the issue with investors and dividents in general is that all the money they get is by definition STOLEN. That's what profit is, the value the workers produce that they aren't paid for.  Your comment tells me you aren't against stealing, neither of the proposals are theft in any way. Also, nobody would have issues with investing if it was treated as loans. But "investment" from 50 years ago was paid through dividents with interest some 40 years ago, everything after that was pure theft.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Raising the minimum wage would not increase inflation tenfold. It would go up a bit yes, but not that dramatically. The reality is that most people already aren't making anywhere near the federal minimum wage. Most people, even in low-cost of living areas are already making near $15/hr or higher at least. It really should be indexed by the inflation rate, however. The fact that it's been allowed to be stagnant for as long as it has is the problem. If it steadily increased by only a small percentage year over year since 2009, the economy would've had plenty of time to gently adjust to it slowly increasing in the 15+ years since then. However, now, it's so far behind inflation and the cost of living that you kind of just have the rip the band-aid off in the short-term to fix it long-term. As for the affordable housing, that sounds like a failure of the administration more than anything. Obviously, the governor is responsible for administering and overseeing that, so if it fails under their watch, then it's their fault. They need to hold these people accountable.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly, capatalism could still work, but its too biased right now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The absolute irony of this whole situation is that this sort of economic exploitation, caused by the very most fundamental principles of capitalism as a CONCEPT btw, is exactly why the flames of fascism, communism, socialism, and other radical ideas (good or bad) flared up in the middle of the 20th century! Nothing has changed! History repeats itself. And low and behold; people are turning to alternate systems of economy and government.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Here’s the problem, communism won’t fix the underlying issues of a degenerate culture.  To fix both the economy and degeneracy, you must escape both the left and right and head over to a third position.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Goobergobbs  Communism is a doomed system that incentivizes deteriorating mediocrity.  If doing better than others because of merit means you get punished, why even bother being good. Why not join the people who are doing worse and benefit from other payers.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The sad thing is it will make things much worse , what we have is capitalism corrupted by a regulatory state that limits competition through especially zoning laws
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The only issue I have with this is the Supreme Court, it was designed to be elitist and isolated from the influence of American Politics (Ideally), and often times a US presidents greatest legacy isn’t in their legislative or military victories but who they appoint to the Supreme Court. It’s why the Supreme Court is always an administration behind ideologically, and along with that they are ideally the bulwark of stability they take their time on stuff and they have to. Even then you can keep the Supreme Court Accountable and that is getting Congress to pass a Constitutional Amendment, if you do not like their ruling on a law. But that requires an effective Congress that can actually Compromise and work together to achieve something. So ironically enough a good chunk of our issues comes from a weak Congress.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I would normally say I aint reading all that but I read it all these are some great tips thanks
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Prestonprezzy  Thank you for spending the time to read it.   Things suck right now but we've been in just as bad, if not worse, places before and things got better because we worked together.  Having a good foundation of what your specific goals are helps you find people who agree with you and grow more as a movement.   Like I said before, looking up the work of people like the Black Panthers or STAR is a great way to feel less doomer. Half of what I talk about in the other post is similar to shit advocated by them.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @The-Devils-Advocate Of course, but you need to be able to explain to people the ideas you want and why they are good initially, especially if they havent enganged with ideas like this before beyond whats provided by limited stuff. Also people dont know how to organize. People arent intrinsically knolegeable so you need to be able to direct them to living orgs and acessable places to get those bits of info.   Do things, show things, get people curious and motivated to learn more after seeing your example.   Sell them on it.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Today's situation does suck. I know that times are harder now then they were during my parents generation, my parents are older in their mid 60's. The solution is absolutely to work harder though! I was able to buy my first house when I was 19 (2015) for $350k. I cut back on things that I didn't need, I worked two jobs and grabbed all the overtime I possibly could. I didn't go to university because I could see how big of a waste in time and money that was, I went to college to get a trade and put in the time to learn all aspects of my industry. Now I make really good money but I work 7 days a week for it, it's not a desirable lifestyle right now but that's the thing about hard work, it pays off. I'm in a place where I should be able to retire in my early 40's and with all the tech that we have at our disposal, it allows hard work to take you even further. Delay that gratification, put in the work, set yourself up, don't fall into the mindset that life is too hard. It is hard, but there are ways to absolutely kill it today that never existed even 10 years ago. Stay strong and focused, think before you do, find the calm in your mind before making big decisions.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you want higher wages corporations need to have competitive wages, but this won't happen due to the flood of foreigners (cheap disposable labor) repeatedly being dumped into the job market. Deport everyone who has not been a legal resident for 10 or maybe even 15 - 20+ years. Immigration needs a complete freeze with exception granted for exceptionally skilled individuals such as doctors. The dollar would go even further if unnecessary spending is addressed like the shoveling of billions upon billions of dollars overseas. Impose a 2 home maximum ownership limit on giga corporations like BlackRock, if they already own above that limit then the excess must be sold within 5 years before financial penalties are applied per individual excess home. Politicians need to be banned from trading stocks and have term limits for all positions to prevent the corruption we see today and allow for people more familiar with current happenings and technology to be law makers.   The primary function of the government is to protect and ensure the prosperity of it's people. The Western world cannot fund the entire 3rd world, they are not and should never have been a priority.    Realistically, we won't get any of this from our Crypt Keeper run governments.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The only disagreement I have with the whole "but look at what other countries in Europe are doing", is that it helps a lot when you don't have to spend as much on defense since the USA does most of that for you.

I guess if you know your way around a Linux kernel, it’s easier to be a cyber criminal these days.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The only question is in which direction. Never have I seen a generation more divided between building heaven, or building a worse Hell.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: we solve most of these problems by rejecting immigration, work visas, refugees, and deporting illegal immigration, a people should not have to compete for labor, aid, housing, and other local resources with foreigners in their own home land, but the system was never meant to look out for our best interests it was to facilitate monetary interests for power and exploitation so it will never throw us a bone to do anything but keep us docile because it can not birth things that are not supported by its incentive structure
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't agree with most of these points, but I agree that SOMETHING needs to change

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think one thing alot of people refuse to talk about is feminism, and how it has a huge hand in just how priced out we have become. We will never be able to have the same buying power as people did in time's where women did their duty as a mother and were housewives to care for kids so fathers could focus on doing their duty and provide for their family. If youre not gonna take women out of the workforce than there is not going to be any changes to buying power.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @CertifiedGirlThing I can't think of a single person I've ever known in my life who was able to go to a 4-year university debt free. Yet, most professions absolutely require a 4-year degree at a bare minimum (unfortunately an associate's is almost useless for most professions on its own). If you have to pay for room and board, that cost skyrockets.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In a system, where no student loan means, you have to work 5 crappy jobs or die on the street... voluntarily isn't the word, I would use.  But in the end, still way to few people realizes, they are worst then slaves in the land of the free.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thats why I followed up with proposing we change the actual cause, instead of just canceling debt. Because canceling of debt just resets the clock, doesn't fix the core issue at all together.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And doesn't Ireland have higher taxes than America?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @AVIATOR309yeah but you can live for much cheaper. That said, cost of living here as 2-3x since covid.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ireland has similar problems to the US actually, housing prices are insane, government is incompetent at best, and wealth inequality is increasing at a rapid pace.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @darkmatter9643 so true. It’s getting realll bad for the average person.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, but having to do 2-3 jobs just to barely even live in a home is not something that should exist, also since 2015 your current home might be like $1.5M now, back in the 70 and 80s you really needed only one job to provide for a family and still have enough to do some stuff, now you cannot even be in a house and eat with one job, and also, it is a miracle you haven't been released from your jobs either, as companies are so money hungry that they will layoff in a heartbeat, also, job opportunities are few and far between when it comes to chances of getting em, and, wages just should be higher as it is just ridiculous as some CEOs are making a 1000x the average wage of workers in their own companies. It is good that you got lucky and are somewhat content with how you are going, many tens of millions aren't.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The thing is, even if we stop the people from coming in like that, corporations will do what they've been doing for years, find labor in other countries that are cheaper than in the US. So even if we go through the expensive and cruel process of deporting them all, we will fix nothing. However, huge agree on limiting how much corporations can own and banning politicians from trading stocks. That massive level of conflict of interest is deeply disgusting. And most certainly yes to term limits! New people NEED to be brought in if we are going to stay up to date with the world as it is now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i agree that cheap labor is a problem, but i also think giant corpos have the power to just leave and find labor elsewhere. additionally, we need to make sure that if we stop immigration that birth rates go up. without immigration we are not at the 2.1 fertility replacement rate
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: so you, as a working class individual, see another working class man getting exploited and under paid, and instead of getting angry at a system that incentivises endless growth and profits over everything else, you choose to get angry at the man being exploited living under the same system you are?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'd agree but mass deportations are cruel and expensive as crap. The better, permanent solution is to constitutionally remove the concept of cheap labor and force every employer to pay a living wage. People will complain about their corpos going bankrupt, but my question is who cares.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @WolfyVoids  Mass deportation which includes people who have legally immigrated and have lived in the subject nation for the duration I stated, especially if they are actually contributing to society and working rather than leeching social programs is absolutely cruel and awful.  I only think that it's necessary because the numbers that have come in are so extreme. Had immigration been handled reasonably it would've never been a problem. Even if we were to deport immigrants who have not lived in the subject nation for 40+ years it still wouldn't completely fix the problem with how long the system has been broken. Were the government to force corporations to pay proper wages that cost would just be passed onto the consumer, and even if that were blocked by the government those corporations would just leave that country in response. I don't think there's a clean way out of this mess. I really hope I am wrong, but I just can't see any other way out of this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes, but if we actually went after efficiency in that spending, then it would be peanuts in the grand scheme of things. Also I don’t mean to take on the Europeans model. I do believe we should be extremely selective of what works and doesn’t and build a unique solution out of whats working and happening all over the world. This would be genuine progress and innovation of ideas.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Brother, we spend more on government healthcare per capita than anyone else, you don't gotta TOUCH the defense budget to fix this shit
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Even so, the economies of Europe have been underperforming to the point of stagnation for at least two decades now. While the US economy is currently struggling compared to years past, it's still outperforming almost every single other nation on earth, and the US economy stands as one of the only fully developed nations in existence with an economy that is still growing faster than the rate of inflation. The other economies across the Western world are struggling to a far worse degree than the US is, and it's to the point where most of the economies across Europe are struggling to even keep up with inflation anymore.   Germany, by far the most productive European nation, and the European nation with the largest economy, has experienced almost no economic growth whatsoever since 2008 when accounting for inflation. There's a reason why Europe is waning into economic irrelevance, and why the economies of China and other southeast Asian nations have come to supplant Europe in terms of economic relevance and technological development. It's no coincidence that Europe is absent in the various technological races for supremacy. It isn't the US vs China in discussion after discussion by random chance. It's the US vs China in every single cutting edge topic of discovery and development because those are the two most productive economies with the highest rates of consistent growth that are capable of putting their money where their mouth is.   Europe no longer belongs in the same discussion, unfortunate as that is. Whether people realize it or want to admit it or not, Europe is a has-been power on the world stage, and much of their remaining degree of relevance is thanks to being close allies with the United States. Without the US, Europe would have little relevance in modern global affairs, least of all in macroeconomics. They're among the last group of countries we should be looking to as a good example.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @EarlyExitPlan  I do enjoy your commentaries. I just have a sad reflection that while we can talk about those things, we can't actually change anything.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You wanna fix the job market. Get rid of illegal aliens and HB1 visas where they are importing people who will work for 7.50 an hour. You wanna fix the housing market. Make corporate owning of houses illegal, encourage building new homes, and get rid of section 8 housing. When I say section 8 housing theres laws if you have an apartment at a certain price you are required to take in section 8 and ive seen more than id like to count of section 8 people who would do nothing but shit up the place and not pay rent. Unions are okay but before that we need some sort of new mindset in companies who want to own their whole business and not have a shareholder board. Look at Arizona, five guys, etc. The stock market is literally a scam and does nothing for the working person.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The biggest problem with the minimum wage question is that, Yes, the companies SHOULD be able to absorb it, but we all know, they won't, they'll just import people from foreign countries so they don't have to pay them minimum wage, and the higher population will cause prices to increase while also increasing unemployment for us. Immigration is a huge problem.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We all need to remember what we as a generation were left with by those who came before us when we enter politics and the workforce in greater numbers. We must be the ones to cleanse our nations of the filth, and rebuild from the ground up a system that is designed to uplift the common folk, so that nobody is truly left behind. We must never allow personal politics to hinder our cooperation for a brighter future. We must not believe the lies told to us. We must reclaim what made our forefathers so great. We must reclaim our sense of shared identity.  Stop falling for the media that spoon feeds you comforting lies designed to keep brethren divided. Conduct your own research, and hold conversations with people face to face, even if you fundamentally disagree. An educated generation scares those in power. Fight now, so that your children and their children may live in a better world.

Then you've got all the Indian H1B and OPT and other abuses where they chain migrate entire extended families... yeah, we've got a foreigner problem.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What worries me the most is the inevitable war that we'll have amongst ourselves from people wanting real change to other Gen Z-ers wanting to keep the status quo because they're family/friends of current politicians and currently are set for life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The other day my girlfriends dad said his first mortgage was $500 for a 4 bed 3 1/2 bath house. The lowest rent I can find for a 2 bed APARTMENT is 1,200, and you need to make 3x that to qualify for said apartment. :Btw this was 10-20 years ago
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You did a great job at calling out the problems of the economy and inflation over the last 5 years.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a millennial who never went to college and who’s been mainly working. I know the pain. Even now, I’m just starting to get back into the workflow of work again. I work at a grocery store doing laborious work cleaning various different areas. Thankfully the pay is relatively decent.   But when I was unemployed I was applying to anywhere. Was unemployed for 7 damn months with only 2-3 interviews. And had been on unemployment. And now I owe the state 11k.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is what I think about everyday at work, where my boss does everything possible to extract more value. My job used to be one of the best skilled manufacturing jobs in the country, now I can hardly make rent.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm genuinely terrified to get older because of what's going on
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People are so overworked and burned out. I think each department in my company needs at least double the people. The workload is absolutely crazy. I’m stressed all the time.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm about ready to burn some beautiful oak doors for warmth.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: videos like this give me some hope for the idea of a future and how the younger generation may change the world with time
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Lets admit it. We need to fight for our own chance. The old who are supposed to support us through their "wisdom" are just taking away from us with their greed. Their needs to be a rebellion. Atleast some sort of unity, so that we can support the future generations like beta and onwards, after we've built the world better, so we can be better than our elders. Actual goosebumps seeing the amount of people my age waking up for change! Stay strong brothers! 🗣💪🗣🗣
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I GOT THAT BUNNY AD RIGHT INFRONT OF THIS VIDEO
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There was an analog horror that had a line that was like "Know that i am aware" or something  Thats what gen z is doing  In constantly propping booogeymen, the "old guard" accidentally turned their descendants into their one true opposite: Normal People.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Voting alone can't get us where we need to be, we need a regime change which has not once come without violence.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: for context and I'm 14, I am on my school's swim team, an eagle in boy scouts, and I have nothing on my record, AND I spent 5 hours updating my resume, AND I sent in over 30 applications and not even an email back.  Gen alpha cooked😭😭😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I live in Jersey, and I’ve been a welder for 5 years now. I was able to buy a condo at the age of 25 (I’m now 27) and I just had to sell it because I could no longer afford it. I’m making 37 an hour, living with my parents again and forced to move to PA just to afford a home. I’m so tired of this system, and we need to change it. It’s time we actually stand together and demand change
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why is that damn sink always outside
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Rent control/regulation is not ideal. Argentina has all the answers you can think of about economic isolation, overregulation, inflation "control", etc. When rent control was abolished back in Dec 2023, all rents became more affordable in a couple of months (until Dec 2023, rent meant around 80-85% of an average monthly salary if you could even find one available, then it went down to about 50% in the city of Buenos Aires and with plenty offers).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: America. The land of the " we rich 70+ year old ceos and gov officials make the rest of citizens fight each other and struggle to live. And as long as we put the blame on "random ethnic group", they wont attack us and keep us in power and free"

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got laid off last month... after working for a year... after half a year of searching for a job... Thank you for this video... I kinda needed this... I was sorta wondering... what is wrong with me. Someone out there implying it is not my fault makes me feel better.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 16:03 Late Stage Capitalism by its basic definition literally means "the current phase of capitalism, characterized by issues like extreme wealth inequality, the dominance of multinational corporations, widespread commodification, and increasing consumer debt". Late Stage Capitalism by definition literally means pure corporate greed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennials are similarly screwed. Working together I hope we can fix this mess to make things better for all of us and for those who come after.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The grass is always greener on the other side as a canadian we currently have a pm who's entire platform is his personal investments. Universal healthcare has pros but also cons, housing is awful. I think we all would like a better future because the way a lot of countries have been headed hasn't been great unfortunately. Corruption is rampant across the world. Hopefully thing can change for the better id love to own a home before my later half of my life

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Gen X I believed you are 100%. Wages have not kept up with inflation and devaluation. Average new home in the mid 70s was 15k and average yearly income was 13k.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z cares and is fed up. They don’t take the surface level propaganda. They know the Internet works.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Younger generations need to get into politics and booting out the geriatric congress and Senate

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Everything with lower age limit should also have an upper age limit. And i mean EVERYTHING
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My biggest personal "pump the breaks" is dismantling the Electoral College; on a surface level it seems contradictory to a Democratic System (Were actually an Electoral Republic), however the Electoral College was put in place as a balance of power against the "Tyranny of the Mob".  If it were removed, what point would there be in even measuring the votes of the smaller states which the College gives power to; bigger, more populated states like California, Florida, Texas, New York, would dominate politics which would remove representation from the smaller states.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the other part ppl tend to not talk about ppl who live or grow up with a disadvantage in life... single parents, foster children, mental health, or probably worst of all physical health... if you have any of these not only is surviving almost impossible but 9/10 times you might as well pray you make it past 25.... its fucked
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Mythical YouTube recommendation pull
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Most people think Gen Z is braindead because of tiktok and media. But if you go out and actually talk to educated students of Gen Z you can see that we are aware and ready to change the system.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a 21 year old, who thankfully has a job that almost pays 18 an hour (I got lucky), even I struggle to make ends meet with some things. I don’t live with my parents and so me and my fiance still struggle with paying for rent or food. Thankfully we’ve gotten better, but it’s never about “working harder” because trust me, we work harder than any generation before us. There are the lazy ones, but there’s plenty of us who work and work and still struggle. Anyone above the age of 40 and tells you that you need to work harder (outside of being your own boss or something) don’t have a say, they don’t understand how tormenting it feels to work and still barely scrape by
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People need to protest by not paying medical bills and student loans en masse

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 40 years old here. Bought my home 12 years ago for 163k. It is now valued at 450k. I consider myself very lucky. I feel for the people just slightly younger than me. I'm the last generation that will own property barring inheritance or being born wealthy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: asmon is a trumper and constantly spews their propaganda... not sure how that would help at all
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Older people will always view the youth and new ideas as a threat. It’s only natural. With the deconstruction of family structure this will only become more apparent in our society.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People that say "Just move somewhere cheaper." Have no idea how it works.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "I'm tired of people just making silly posts and talking about things instead of actually doing the right things. I know exactly what we need to do to fix this." later "Support good things guys, I know it's corrupt and that needs to change. So support stuff that is good" brother gave the most concrete promises and least concrete solutions imaginable

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i'm not even from the US, only gen z, but I think this video should get as viral as possible, and even be treated as a petition of sorts
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You want to fight corporate greed? Over turn Dodge V Ford.  You will be called anti semetic by the ADL if you try. But it’s a Supreme Court ruling that MANDATES a companies first and only concern is to the profit margin of its shareholders.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: He is going to overthrow the government
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: indexing to inflation doesn't work, it just accelerates inflation and spirals out of control, then you'll buy bread with thousands of dollars.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Federal minimum wage is not supposed to be a living wage. Its the definition of how much the laziest employee must be paid.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think what we need now is a strong voice to suck it up and finally call for revolution. We all know it's coming, and honestly, we all need it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im too young for a job but both my brothers own a house by 30 years old, they both had one by 25. They both make 6 figures. One even has a second beach house. they have all college debt paid off. im proud because they both worked hard. I think that working hard really is what you gotta do bro.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I live on the East Coast, and my mom is a real estate agent. I thought 700k+ on a house was good, because the majority of her homes (granted, she is in the waterfront market but still) are 1 million. 500k sounds like a steal to me. It's insane.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You know when cyberpunk 2077 came out a lot of people thought it was to detached from reality. But looking at the violence and expendability that corporations in that game use with its employees, I'm starting to think it's closer to reality that people would like to admit.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fair point. However I have a counterpoint. Chopping block for the wealthy. The French people had a problem with the 1% and solved it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't understand how treating people like humans is a "radical" idea, but actively seeing to it that millions will absolutely suffer is not considered "radical".
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly speaking on minum wage i bet they keep it that low to be able to pay H1B visa holders nothing while still being legal. Every McDonald's starts at $15 an hour at least and thats in Ohio.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Minecraft was a future preparedness simulater in hindsight. Housing prices are so insane we r gonna live underground to survive.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I can attest. My mom just turned 37 and still isn’t ready to buy a house to no fault of her own. She is a factory worker and make decent money (from what I’ve gathered. Havnt strait up asked her) she has even talked about trying to rent a place in the next year or two. We have lived with my grandparents our entire lives and she works her ass off for me and herself and it still isn’t enough.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the first home buyer age is increasing faster than age. Soon enough my parents will be first home buyer age.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Huh? 29:05 The USA has some of the highest quality healthcare in the world, rich/insured Canadians fly to the USA for high level medical treatments.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There goes another problem, not all countries allow citizens to have any defense equipments, not to mention propaganda and entertainment brainwashing in some of them...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: lets not talk about the fact that it became abused and led to napoleon risisng a  strongman who ended the first republic in france oh and he was average height for the time
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My mom is 49 and has never owned a house.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: how come then that i saw a video of a swede going on a plane home to sweden just for a normal checkup and then fly back to the US because its still sheaper. The healthcare might be good, but why does it matter if none can afford it?

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: in europe the house market is also sky high but here in belguim there is a system that increases wages with inflation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: One thing about gen z not wanting to work, its damn true. The highest rates of government assistance for able men under 25, the 4 years of covid fallout where i personally knew dozens of people my age who were BRAGGING about unemployment. The degeneracy and depletion of values in conjunction with the “lots of effort, no reward” aspect of today’s job market have resulted in an entire generation actively avoiding the traditional ladders and routes.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have been saying for years now as a 23 yr old on college. The system is rigged against married couples who want families. When we had 1 income for 12 bucks an hour we couldn’t get food stamps. They said that my college tuition didn’t count as cost. But when I was single I could get snap.  The other thing is corporations have monopolized everything. It’s suffocating everyone and working for them is worse. I’ve been treated like a second grade citizen bc we r busting our butts for pocket change.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have an idea: Collate local elections by state, then by candidate and their supported policies. Optionally, include the sponsors who are backing these candidates, down to the last chain link of economic support. By this metric, you can make every local election crystal clear on who you can vote for in your area.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The median age of a home buyer currently is 59 which is even more concerning
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Y’know? I originally wanted to be a software engineer, but electrical engineering in a trade school is looking really tempting right now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am a 16-year-old guy from Georgia. I have never seen a political video I genuinely mostly agree with, but I decided to devote my time to this one and God was it worth it. I always talk about the 2-party system being the downfall of our country and what is dooming our future. I feel like none of my peers hear me and just want to live in this cycle without change/leave the country blindly without any regard for the future. The lack of patriotism on one side and lack of empathy on the other is astonishing. It's almost like nobody truly cares anymore. I intend to stay here for the rest of my life but if nobody puts in the work to change this country then why should I stay? Anyways, regardless of your political affiliation, please put in your effort so we can break this monopoly of a two-party system and have genuine power to vote for our true beliefs. Right now, we are pigeonholed into extremes on either side, and I don't think many people realize this. If we break free of this duarchy of sorts and break the parties into fractions, you don't even know how much it would improve the future for this nation. Currently, the large majority of us are unable to express our true beliefs and fight for the future we deem optimal in these circumstances. For the love of God, bring down this oppressive order and restore independence/liberty.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I periodically do the technical interviews, and am looking for a few things for entry level. The applicant is able to explain a common/current technical concept. Is able to articulate how they would do problem solving (using a basic scenario). And is honest, when I throw a curve ball question (i.e. "sorry I haven't done this technology"/"not familiar" ... or asking for more information to see if they can figure out my question). I actually find a lot of people applying have low quality experience, so barely look at what they have done. But am interested if they are actually capable of thinking on their feet.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I love listening to foreign country’s gen z that maybe can change something in my country. Just maybe
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m already 26 and make $30+ an hour for an employee owned company. And to say how dreadful it is to look at home prices now that I’m in (or what i thought was) in the position to buy one for my family of 4, it’s terrible. I work the full time while my fiancé works 3 individual smaller jobs and we’re STILL renting a home with 2 other adults. This system is gone. It was hardly even there to begin with it seems. I’m tired of being hopeless to providing my family with a comfortable life. Not even a wealthy one. I don’t need that. Just comfortable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: College was too expensive for me so i ended up moving into lawncare but honestly even running the business is still barely making anything more than $20 a month cause my insurance and over a couple grand in repairs cause i use used equipment and I can't even afford a house at all and I'm also on 3 incomes lawncare hay farm working and one state job as a babysitter for my adopted siblings so yeah it's nice not being able to do much
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I really hope we don’t make the expected life expectancy any higher 🙏
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: AI might kill us all before that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was born in 04. I'm working two jobs rn over 70 hours a week, I don't have a vehicle, walk to work which takes me an hour both ways, and I'll never ever consider taking a loan out. Maybe a credit card. But yeah we need to work harder huh. And I have no interest going to college, it's pointless. Maybe maybe trade school, but I need to get a car
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I make 32$/hr and it basically still feels like minimum wage. I’m just baffled by how unsatisfied my finances are even with such a high paying job.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: maybe the reason they were getting government assistance was because of a global pandemic did you maybe think of that? also i like how to back up your argument you have to use personal experience coz you cant find and statistics that support your claim.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: At this point I rather let humanity die off.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @EarlyExitPlan you speak the truth we need people like you in leadership positions  Keep up the good work
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Love this bro but why is it in 4K?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They neglected to teach us that we can do something about this as the ones to hold the torch next, but we got the idea anyways.   Don’t underestimate your capabilities yall. Get active, use your voice, let’s get it done.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 48 so Gen X. Make over 100k a year in Memphis which is low cost of living. I still cannot buy a house. Prices are too high in every thing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: lmao, I remember the time when a grocery chain in my country had a job ad asking for some shit like master's degree, passport, 5 years experience etc. the job was a grocery cashier, 50 pesos below minimum wage. lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If we raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, my job that pays 17 will still barely afford my rent and food. Minimum wage should be 25 or 30 or maybe higher. Our grandparents could afford homes because their minimum wage adjusted for inflation and housing costs was over $65 per hour. But even a $65 minimum wage is just a band-aid on a bigger, deeper, fundamental issue with how we run our society.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: most news makes me feel so hopeless, even some of the more progressive news channels i follow just talk about how things are going wrong. This video makes me hopeful, I often have wondered to myself about what i can do to try to make my future better, and this video is well made. I also really enjoyed watching a minecraft video while you spoke.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: take a shot every time he says literally
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Graduated and turned 18 this summer, got a part time job that pays me jack shit. I complain about it and my family members tell me "just work a full time job" or "work harder". Im trying, 15 applications later and nothing. Only one company called me back and they wanted my 18 year old ass to move states to work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The US is controlled by the richest -- and yet still the greediest -- people in the world.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Love all the ideas, I wish someone like you could run and make a difference, even when people do run with genuine ideas they wanna execute, red tape and power imbalance always kills it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ll like it to help share but dude you have got to get better at Minecraft 😂😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a millennial, just turned 30. When I was in my early 20's I worked 2 jobs, was uninsured because my job didn't give me enough hours to qualify for benefits. I had to say yes to every extra shift basically within my region, (I was a cook). And I worked 6 days a week for 3 years. My co workers I've become friends with now thought I was older with how I acted 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Remember when a bunch of veterans turned miners in West Virginia started a revolution that, despite failing, changed US workers rights laws and regulations forever? Might be a good time to recall that event. The Battle of Blair Mountain.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We are getting closer and closer to making cyberpunk 2077 a reality
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not gonna lie... If my home country was as f*cked as the us... I would just... Leave...  Imagine living in a country that has the highest federal healthcare spending per capita while also being one of the only 1st world countries were people are afraid to go to a hospital because they don't want to end up in what can only be described as soul crushing poverty. Thats absolutely f*cking mental.  Largest economy in the world yet you will be in almost generational debt if you go to college or get a serious illness. Great.  The system in the us is so... I don't even have words....
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The problem with healthcare and how it works in different countries, is that the wait time in other countries is much more than the U.S.   You’re wanting a service over quality. We look at other countries with it without looking at the specifics of what goes on when it comes to how quickly someone is taken care of.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I really do hear that Gen Z is mostly gonna be made up of single men who have conservative view points, distrust of the mainstream media, and gonna at least be religious leaning.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: But also back then if you consider they were making 65 an hour, a coffee from a shop would be like 30 dollars. So if you saved 1 coffee a day for 2 or 3 years you could buy a home with that. The stuff we need got super expensive and luxuries like coffee and flat screen TVs are dirt cheap, but our grandparents dont understand that and think we are wasting our money when really we are just doing the only and best we can while trying not to go insane from lack of hope.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i have been trying to get a job since june and i have a friend who has been unemployed for a year. if ONE thing goes wrong me and my fiance have to choose between food and bills
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The answer is in the constitution. While we followed it, we had a great nation. Now we don't, and you can see for yourself what that has done.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 13:55 Yes, a CEO works harder than an average person, they also take on more risk.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 15:09 I don’t see a lot of young guys in construction. Just boomers in management and addicts in labor. I stick out like a sore thumb because I’m the only guy under 26 doing this. Nobody wants to do it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Affordability is becoming a problem because of the FEDERAL RESERVE which is destroying the purchasing power of the dollar because of something called money printing or quantitative easing. And we then go to war and spend tax dollars on the endless wars. So the solution: stop the bleeding by drastically bringing down the government spending. Then end the FED. But at this point, none of this will happen. The government and the corporations are working together to screw the American tax payer.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Things will either get better, or Gen Z is going to usher in some crazy form of government because we've been backed into a corner
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You need to be a voice spread across social media, everything here in this video is something I’m trying to get friends to look at. Blackrock, the company system in general that destroys opportunity in chase of money. Taking control of things that don’t concern economy solely but the quality of life and our future. Outdated politics that encourages focus on social standards and division rather than a collective thought process that prioritizes including everyone and not just making the rich happier.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m praying this all gets better when I become an adult (I’m an 8th grader)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I live in Texas making 23$ an hour while working 50 hours a week and even then have a hard time with food and rent

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I believe that social democracy is as close as we can get to what you've said. Good luck, hope to see your videos soon.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly everything you said is so based and practical. This is the first time I’ve agreed with any YouTube video’s entire political opinion, all the way down to me, personally also planning to eventually leave the United States. Thank you for this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My one issues in all of this, is why are Corporations providing Welfare to workers and citizens. Like why does life insurance come from Raytheon and not the goverment itself. The corporation should pay wages, while the gov should be in charge of protecting and providing for the people.

Land that didnt cost anything to build the air trees dirt didnt cost a cent there is no development whatsoever yet I have to pay for it. The amount of ways that the government just robs you legally is insane.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was 24 when i bought my house this year. Found a house outside of the city i worked in, GrandRapids, MI. I paid 155k for my house. I make 32 an hour. The answer is find a job suitable thats not inflated.. something that is NEEDED and not many new generational people are going into.. like TRADES. You will find success. You will buy your home. And you really won't struggle. Im a Mobile forklift technician. I work 40 hours a week. All my bills are paid, food in the fridge, with no concern of lay offs. When you get into a niche job that the country NEEDS to operate... you'll be perfectly fine. That's coming from me, now 25, and I've become fairly successful. 5 years i ago i was a apprentice in college making 16$ an hour and now have doubled that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Increasing the price of labor increases the price of goods and services. Goods and services require labor, so increasing the price of labor increases how much it costs to make those goods and services happen. There is very little proof that increasing wages increases productivity.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: These kind of housing policies you're suggesting are consistently shown to disincentivise construction and end up with less housing being built. Prevent corporations from buying homes, deregulate construction, etc, but absolutely do not implement rent controls, that is always a disaster.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: its the same issue with the welding and trade industry, they're asking for like 3-5 years for experience, but all the welder and people that used to do it are retiring, and there is no where for me to get the experience to get those jobs, and even with that if you can get the job, people are paying welders like 17 dollars a hour which is extremely low for that job, the average is like 40 and above an hour, so the people is just straight up killing the industry by suffocating it.

Where none of this discrimination or political divide exists. Where we may not all be millionaires and still may have to hustle. But at least we’ll be able to find a job, a partner, buy a house together and live a comfortable life. Where especially during this holiday season we’ll be able to all go to the movie theater and watch the movie of a year and then go out to eat with family for dinner. We can go holiday shopping knowing our pockets might get tight but still we’ll splurge on our loved ones because we want to and want to see their reactions on Christmas morning. On New Year’s Eve we will all be hopeful that the next year will be better. And at the end of the day we’ll all feel comfortable about the kind of world our kids will grow up in. Where they won’t have to worry if their college degree is worth it, or that they won’t be able to buy a house, etc… Is that simple dream too big to ask for?

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m an international Business student minoring in Philosophy from Wisconsin and hopefully going into politics when I get out, I say it is false that we are in survival mode because this current system is not survivable. Anyone I know who has money has made it illegally. Even my own dad who tries to do it legally is drowning in debt and taxes and is a vp of engineering of a major food deliver company! If someone like that struggles financially because they are doing it legally it’s apparent that anyone who isn’t struggling is either doing it illegally or some random obscure loophole they created by buying politicians. When a literal medieval peasant can have a decent life and have a a whole entire 3rd of the year off (adding up the various days they did not have to work not including Sundays) and yet my job at dollar general is threatening to fire me because I have school and wish to not work Sundays there’s a big problem (I literally barely make enough for gas money I’m only still alive because I’m reliant on my parents and the school)

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was lucky enough to be able to buy a house at 25 after I got into PhD school, but that was only after immense effort and also luck. I'm an archaeologist so I worked almost a year straight away from home and my fiancee living in hotels working 6-7 days a week 10-12 hours a day and saving almost all of my per diem so it was peanut butter sandwiches and ramen every night. I was also lucky enough to build my credit score enough to get a decent credit rate, and even with this the under writer grilled me for every tiny minor thing that would show up on my W2. I also had the foresight when I started working at 22 to stash some money away in a Roth IRA which you can make a 1 time tax free deduction for a first time homebuyers. And it's not like I was looking at a Mcmansion I did all of this to buy a 950 square foot house. And despite all of that it was still cheaper than renting in the area. So many things needed to fall in place just perfectly for me and not without essentially sacrificing a year of my life, and I'm still a lucky one

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's hard to work with one party when they are constantly obstructionist towards the specific remedies you mentioned. They do not want to help poor people. They want us to go away. They don't want to accept your right to exist. They can't be forced to, by our own designs in this nation. So, the only way is legislation, which they actively obstruct. So... it kind of is ONE SIDE, being ridiculous. They chose this over 16 career candidates in 2016 and they chose it again in 2024, even at their own expense, social benefits. One side is telling you 'the brown ones are evil.' 'That they want to replace the white ones.' 'They eat babies.' 'They eat cats and dogs...' like?

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1:38 I’m Gen z. Have a great job and about to buy a house at 28. I get it’s tough out there but please take this advice. Hitting quick apply is not applying for a job. You are doing less than the bare minimum. All you doing that does is being a number companies used to justify H1b workers which is what they are trying to do…  If you are not writing a cover letter, you are not actually applying to the job. I have survived multiple layoffs at multiple companies with a generic business degree. I had bosses saying the same thing.   “I’ve applied to x amount of places and haven’t even gotten an interview”.   “Did you write a cover letter?”  “No”  I literally say, copy and paste your cover letter and job description into chat GPT, read it, change the obvious mistakes and things you can’t justify/lie about confidently in an interview.  Literally 3 weeks go by and they have a job.   If you have literally never had a job before get one anywhere so you have something to put on your resume. Companies don’t want to hire people into high level roles that have never worked before. A lot of us have been working since 14. Wrote it down. I worked briefly at enterprise rent a car, who is always hiring and is a great stepping stone, and they were more interested about my experience at a pizza shop over an office.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When huge conglomerates like Black Rock move money around - what you see on the ground level is massive layoffs, controlled demolition of companies and business models that are designed to extract the maximum amount of capitol on a balance sheet regardless of long term sustainability in real world terms. This is what the commodification and bussinessification of every aspect of our lives looks like.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 23:21 As a gen Z who is employed in the public health field specializing in homelessness assistance and prevention it is honestly disgusting and disheartening to see how difficult the battle is for a regular person to get housing. Very few jobs that people have come even close to living independently let alone comfortably. It’s insane because I literally am not working a livable wage in my position while attempting to help others who are even worse off. I’m lucky I have a family that supports me but nothing the whole situation just destroys my faith in this country.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Importing millions of people results in competition for jobs and thus lower wages. The same goes for housing. These corporations have sacrificed the very social fabric of the nation out of greed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "But raising the minimum wage would increase prices!" As if the prices aren't already increasing with the wage barely changing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is all because of rich people’s subsidiaries corporate lobbying and politician’s friends bribing the government to keep their money
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ve noticed, one of the reasons why they’re trying to hammer us into the ground, is because they know we won’t take this crap, if we know we won’t take it, they’re terrified of us because we aren’t afraid to speak our minds, and follow up on our actions, i don’t plan on doing anything political, but push comes to shove I’m getting a group of people, and one way or another getting an age limit, and term limit on all government jobs, both Madagascar and Nepal got overthrown by our generation in this year alone, and the other governments see that, and are desperately trying to censor and hide the fact that, despite everything in their power, the people always win, I believe that we will see the day of a renaissance, a revolution, a mass overthrow, a day where our generation takes everything that we’re owed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So I come from a small city there’s a lot of points I agree with on your end in fact most of the conversation as a Gen Z member   One of the saving graces in my college time was all the odd internships I was able to get, I’m still in college so doing that and fortunate to have my bachelors and masters covered  Housing is something I worry about so is the job market  The ironic thing is we’re reliving the 1880’s early 1900’s and Mark Twain once remarked at history’s rhythmic patterns 😂 and we live in an era of Carnegie’s and Rockerfellars and when that was happening there was a progressive political figure named Teddy Roosevelt who stemmed the tide of capitalist exploitation   In politics we need to balance our Laissez-Faire identity with the progressive watchdogging that was headed by a Teddy Roosevelt the issue at hand is there hasn’t been a politician who’s had or was willing to confront the issue since Teddy   What we need big time is to break up parties, force political campaigns to have a strict spending limit supplied by a government represented by every party in America  The issue there is which state will support the more odd sounding American parties and I think we need to separate state and nation and have state representation from independent non-aligned candidates it should be illegal to align as a state representative and a national election to install an equivalent amount of representation from each representing party in America to check each political body due to the inner squabbling   This would force Americans to be active citizens and in a bid for each party’s winner to be re-elected on the national circuit they would thus need to conform to American demands since they’ve been cut from any and all outside supports not directly supplied from the us budget which at the start of every year will be equally set aside and all candidate representatives in each party will be chosen for their position 1.5-2 years before the election so we can fiscally spend  The other thing too is we need to freeze US spending on mass or find a way to grow our economy and outpace debt I prefer option 2 and the best way to do is to do a lot of which you proposed in the video   Anyways that was a rant and a half but I’ve long been a proponent at the complacency of our politicians and citizens in the political system and the capitalization of it also the lack of multi party representation as a 5th form of check and balance since we’ve been in an era where it can be difficult for branches to check each other I.e. single party domination
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Drinking game: take a shot every time he mispronounces 'access/accessible/accessibility' dies

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: More companies need to be like HEB. They CARE about us. Ive never felt more loved at a job than HEB. They even invest private stock into you as you work, which can build up which encourages you to stay with them longer.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They gave us amendments. Use em.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: All of those proposed solutions are great, in theory. It only works if people are motivated enough, educated enough, and have the free time to spend advocating for this. These are great long-term goals, but what about the short-term? Well, If corporations are enjoying record profits then you have to hit them where it hurts -- the wallet. Stop shopping at large retailers and support small local businesses, which I realize is harder said than done for many people. But regaining a grass root movement I think could help fight on a smaller and more localized level. The offensive plan has to be multi-layered; while we starve corporations by voting with our money elsewhere, we then apply that collective pressure on our local and federal governments to implement more equitable policies that can improve our quality of life. Take back what's ours.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is why we need to end the open borders and fix up the legal immigration system.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I understand that these changes may never come in my lifetime, but I am okay with that because I don't want our kids to suffer like we are now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey guys! I’ve seen a few of you mention that the economic aspect of this conversation was left out of the video, and I want to reinforce that it’s not because it isn’t a huge part of the problem. Like I said in the final thoughts, I have talked about how the system has screwed over Gen Z in many videos already, and I will link them here for you to watch. This was just a conversation expanding on the social and emotional situations Gen Z is dealing with. It's not to discount how shitty of a hand they have been dealt economically haha  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xosRVxzjgA&t=1s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2Rrc3BwZE4&t=195s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dY7KA_OPVo&t=27s
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a teacher, and I'm so concerned for this generation. I see students falling into one of two groups. The first has absolutely zero ambition, no goals, and is chronically disassociated from reality, swiping through a screen until the end of time. The other group is driven by achievement and constantly chasing perfection. These are the "resume builders" as I call them, but the constant grind is driving them into depression and anxiety when they can't live up to their own expectations. I have students in 11th grade showing the same signs of chronic burnout that I had at 26 working four part time jobs. Its crazy....
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The idea that Gen Z doesn't want to grow up is kinda absurd to me. I think it's more accurate to say that Gen Z is entirely and utterly jaded by the world we've been born into. The milestones/ teenage life that we see idealized in movies is just not possible anymore. Society hates teenagers now. I remember going to the mall in high school and after like 5 pm you had to be accompanied by an adult or you got kicked out. You want to walk somehwere so you don't have to beg your parents for a ride? It's 5 miles away and there's no sidewalks or trees for shade. We didn't design our neighbourhoods for playing basketball in the streets. Parents are too afraid to let kids out of their sights because everything on the internet is telling us to be afraid. Parents won't let their kids have sleepovers anymore and unfortunately their reasoning is valid. Plus they're tracking you with your phone, so sneaking out is a no go. Every mistake you make has consequences. I actually think that Gen Z feels the pressures of what they're supposed to feel at age 20-30 in middle school and high school but with none of the experience or economic backing. We're asking 12 year olds to test into special high schools just to get a shot at a good career. And it turns out that career isn't going to pay you enough to live anyway, if you get a job at all. I don't think Gen Z has the economic standing to take risks without major consequences. Even if you do everything right, you can barely afford to live. You literally have to be born into a good life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got rejected from McDonald's despite having a previous job, answering the quiz to the best of my ability and having full availability. This is the world gen z are facing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here. I want to grow up. I have a Bachelor's and a Master's. I have been applying for jobs for 5 years. The reality is, the industry at large has changed. Getting a job feels impossible. I have a Master's. I got a contract job with Google. They laid me off in the middle of the day one month into my second contract. Since I haven't even gotten a phone call. This isn't a Gen Z problem. This is a everyone problem. I've seen so many people just unable to get jobs. You have 1000s of people applying to one job. A job that more then likely is just up to add more data to their database so they can sell it to other companies. Like that job listing might not even be real.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i feel like economic concerns play a much bigger part in this than decision paralysis or even mental health issues. I live with my parents but the reason I'm not in any hurry to move out because everyone i know who is my age and more "independent" is living in a significantly worse situation. My only friends who live outside their parents house live in tiny crowded apartments with multiple roommates, work long hours and barely make enough to afford rent and food. its hard to convince yourself  to move out when the only thing you will gain by doing so is more social isolation and more debt
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a gen z teenager is trying to actually succeed in life, it’s really exhausting to explain to people constantly that it’s not that we don’t want to succeed, it’s just that everyone and everything around us is indicating that the metric for success is unattainable. There’s no reason to work so hard if you think you’re going to fail entirely. And it’s not that I’m lazy or anything as I’m going to college in a few months to be an attorney but I just think it’s insane that we expect people who are told that the benchmarks for success and truly “living life” are so easy when I know a group of 3 people who can’t even pay rent in a one bedroom anymore because everything is so expensive
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When they see their parents working themselves into the ground with little or nothing to show for it, AI likely to cause mass unemployment, and countries killing the populations of other countries, I'd lack motivation/direction too. I'm 68 years old, I don't blame them one bit. I look around and see loads of shit in society and politics that is supposed to matter which is utterly pointless.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: its almost like ive grown up surrounded by some of the most cynical and miserable adults imaginable that financially locked themselves into lives that they hate and are completely desperate for young people to suffer from the same mistakes. makes the whole decision making process a bit nerve wracking.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am 28 years old, so I am right on the edge of gen Z and millennial. And I am sick of hearing the argument that gen Z is struggling due to being soft and lazy without acknowledging the complete lack of economic opportunities for young people. I have teenage cousins who are desperately trying to look for work, but how can they compete when even people my age, holding Bachelor degrees, are struggling to find full time permanent work? At least give them the courtesy of acknowledging how the economy is holding them back.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im 22, turning 23 in September. I live with my parents in my childhood bedrooom. I work an office job Monday to Friday and I have a part time job on the weekend working at a high end jewellery store. On evenings, I volunteer at a local community garden that supports food insecurity in my community. I have my full drivers licence. I am not a big spender. I don’t ever go shopping just for the sake of it. I have a full Honours Bacjelors degree. I am starting my Masters this fall and I got a full ride to do it.   By no means would I say I am stunted in life by any action of my own. But I still cannot afford to move out, and I can’t afford my own car. I don’t have really any freedom in life and I don’t know when I will.   I can see why some people would just give up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You've correctly identified all of the symptoms to the greater problem. Economic instability is the root of it all. We can't afford what we need. Minimum wage is a joke (it used to be the wage one man needed to provide for a family of four).   And the police state has gotten insane. We're over criminalized and penalized for existing. My friend had to pay $700 for not being up on their insurance and tags, plus their car got towed because it's city policy to tow the car for expired registration. What good does that do?   We don't have third spaces or walkable communities, so when and where are you going to socialize with people? Plus if you want kids, you're going to be further in debt than others your age. And you have no time because the culture encourages hyper vigilance for your kids. No wonder we have iPad babies, people are afraid to let their kids out into the world. Parentifying your kids is not the solution to that either, though.   On top of that, social media algorithms thrive on increasing division and keeping you addicted to your phone.   It's a cacophony of societal issues all piled up to create the mess we're in now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This isn't just an american problem btw.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z here.  99% of these issues stem from the insurmountable economic/financial disadvantage most of us face and are likely doomed to face for the rest of our lives until this country has a massive upheaval. Our generation isn't lazy, we probably work harder than any other generation in history. Most fellow Gen Zrs I know work multiple jobs, myself included, with some kind of entrepreneurial side hustle. Just to make ends meet (and even then it isn't enough).  Meanwhile we grow up on stories from Gen X and Boomers who bought their 500k-1m value house for a stick of gum and some paperclips "back in their day", and a car and supported an entire family all on a SINGLE part-time job at a factory that robots have since replaced.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I want to add for driving, that a lot of people just don't want a car and many are sick of how necessary they are in the US as well as all the harm they do (e.g. demolishing neighbourhoods and third spaces for highways and car parks, worse mental health, no exercise, unsafe to exist outside in any other way other than being in a car). Movements for better city planning and allowing people to use other modes of transport safely are becoming more popular especially with gen z.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I can't stand the "They're so entitled" approach. I don't have a single friend who's used to the easy life, they're barely getting by and working themselves to the bone and developing mental and physical conditions the entire way. We're not entitled, older generations are.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How are Gen Z supposed to become adults when every door into adult life has been violently slammed in their face?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 3:52 teens aren't interested in getting their licenses because most parents tell their kids if they want to drive they're gonna have to buy their own car. My parents told me this and I didn't get my license until I was 19, moved out, and had to ask my grandmother for a loan to afford a $3000 beater car (because the days of the $500 shit box are gone)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 21 and living through this right now, so here’s some perspective. Not all Gen Z who are “behind” by society’s invisible standards are lazy or coddled. A lot of us grew up in unstable homes, dealing with real issues way before we had the chance to even think about adulthood, let alone prepare for it.  And now we’re entering a world that’s changing faster than ever. I started out studying computer science, but with how quickly AI is advancing, I changed majors because I’m seriously worried about that future career becoming obsolete.  Especially for those of us who didn’t grow up with money, we’re hyper-aware of how one wrong move could ruin our lives. We don’t get the luxury of just “picking something and figuring it out later” like some older generations could.  So no.. we’re not just obsessed with skincare and vibes. Dismissing an entire generation with cheap shots doesn’t make you insightful. It just makes you part of the problem.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I watched the whole video without interruption or looking at the comments,  and as a frequent viewer, I approach your content in good faith. But I think even if all the above issues were completely absent, the growing inequality of wealth, opportunity and even rights would still lead our young people to the same place... a place often of dread and even nihilism, despite their best efforts. And in the US the Big Beautiful Bill is going to create a deficit so large that we can count on future generations facing the same unnavigable adult landscape. It's inconceivable (and possibly in bad faith?) to think about their seeming "lack of direction, drive or adulting" without putting this at the forefront, rather than mentioned at the end, as a footnote. I hope that might add to your understanding of the overwhelming reaction the video is currently receiving.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am a therapist working in an incredibly unaffordable city. I have several GenZ clients who are in challenging living situations because they can’t afford to rent an efficiency apartment on their own or qualify for livable shared spaces with friends or partners. They are stuck living with their parents, sometimes in places where they experienced trauma or abuse, or staying in abusive relationships because the thought of moving out, in this economy, causes more anxiety than the alternative. In therapy, we focus on empowerment, approaching and achieving milestones, celebrating small victories… but all with the understanding that things are way harder than they should be, way harder than was promised, way harder than what they would’ve had to contend with if they were coming of age in a pre-pandemic world. It’s easy to become hopeless when everything is inaccessible. The worst part is that no one seems to see or validate this, outside of their own generation. This is the sense that I get from the people commenting on why economics or inequality can’t be left out of this discussion- that this is another instance of feeling misunderstood, which may be compounded by the fact that you seemed to be a person who “gets it.”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Are you dense? I work at a high school, and Gen Z simply DOES NOT have money. I have teenagers that work full-time jobs and cannot afford the fee to obtain a driver's license. They're unfamiliar with the very concept of an allowance. I'm glad you can discount the economic factors, but the reality is that most people cannot. As other comments have mentioned, you've delineated the symptoms but not the disease, crafting a really bizarre narrative that only applies to upper-class Americans.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ashley I've been following your content for quite a while and I usually find myself agreeing with you, but I think you dropped the ball here. This isn't a conversation that can be held without the economic nuance, matterless if you commented on it in other videos. You as a creator should know that your main source of views isn't from your long-term viewers, but rather from youtube recommendations on people's explore pages and suggestions leading here from other videos. What depth are you demonstrating to these viewers? In my opinion, you need to make sure every single video depicts you as a reasonable and well rounded person.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @PhilipHristoff-o8c  while I agree to a point but there are people in gen z who just truly don’t care to try anything. That’s not all economic based I’m also gen z btw so don’t hit me with your crowd. I’m struggling financially myself but that doesn’t make me directionless or anything else to do with growing up
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video feels like dogpiling on Gen Z for being dealt a terrible hand. Aww, what’s that, you don’t want to get your driver’s license because you can’t afford a car or insurance or gas or repairs because you make minimum wage even with a graduate degree? Poor thing, must be because you’re unmotivated and refuse to grow up 🥺 I know you made many other videos talking about Gen Z, and I appreciate all of them, but leaving out this necessary context makes it seem like you’re victim-blaming and recycling the same old intergenerational talking points.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is not a conversation that can leave out the economic part out without sounded extremely out of touch and as if only wealthy gen z matter. The points in this video are not the primary or even secondary factor of the equation. It's so off it actually offends me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @persomnus okay i thought i was just overreacting in my own head about this but i completely agree w u
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @persomnus  exactly. maybe more people really are overprotective these days but when the minimum wage is $7.25 and rent is 1.6k and people with bachelors degrees are getting auto rejected from mcdonalds and entry level retail jobs, the mental resilience is so insignificant it's basically a non-factor. talking about how kids don't have their driver's licenses when people can't even afford groceries so of course having a car or learning to drive is not a priority right now (also, it's kind of ridiculous to treat learning to drive as a milestone for "taking responsibility" because apart from the fact that a lot of people literally can't afford that, a lot of people also just don't need to be able to drive to live normal fulfilling adult lives. i spent 6 years in a car centric area getting around on the bus. this is just a marketing script for automobile companies at this point). the conflation of social and emotional milestones with economic ones. being emotionally mature doesn't mean you're going to also have a job and be able to afford a house.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @persomnus  I feel for any undiagnosed neurodivergent gen z who watch this.. just a whole video of "you've been coddled and need to suck it up" gaslighting
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Doesn’t even have to with just economical, but the boomer parents we were raised with who were taught mental illness isn’t a thing, to just “get over it” for everything, & that we should just flow through life no matter how fkd up it gets. That’s not a proper way of living and it shows in the evidence of pasts generations as well, so combine that with a fkd up economy…. Then what do you get???
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So you just decided to not mention it? But no money is literally why, though!  There are a lot of things that are shitty with the world right now, but to just dismiss outright the fact that inflation is nuts, the national minimum wage in the US is still $7.50, and a deliberately broken housing market.... there's no excuse.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You're wrong actually.  You come from privilege so you don't understand why late stage capitalism is ruining our futures. Your daddy prolly paid for your doctorate so its cheap sis
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When I turned 18 unemployment was 4% higher then it is now, you also tended to be cut off from your parents within a few months of finishing highschool.  I really don't see economics as being a solid reason.  Katrina and the Waves sang "Going Down to Liverpool" about going there because there were zero jobs there so rent was cheap.  The band UB-40, UB-40 was the UK unemployment form.  Quite often young adults lived on macaroni and weiners sleeping on floors with a bunch of friends and shared the bills.  We still had hope and a dream for the future, it seems these kids gave up before they started.  The world doesn't have a future when the generation that will lead it quit.  Oh for really chilling watch "Love is a Battlefield" by Pat Benetar, the video for the song is about girls that left home, lived on the streets and spent nights at the club hoping someone would take them home in exchange for a place to sleep, maybe a meal and a shower...I keep seeing these people that can afford a phone and a car saying nobody ever had it as hard as them.  Bad part is these kids are spending their parents retirement fund, I feel really bad for the milenials that have 29 year old dependents, you'll only have a decade to save for retirement which likely wont be enough.  There are a lot of reasons but economics is not valid, tough times make tough people, the silent generation showed us that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I understand not wanting to repeat a topic that you’ve covered so many times already (in other very good videos might I add), but these things are so intrinsically linked that it comes off as kind of disingenuous to disregard the economic side for the majority of the video, as it quite literally is the number 1 factor for the vast majority of people, regardless of their psychological and emotional profiles.  I hope you don’t take any of these comments personally by the way, it’s a very understandable oversight. I don’t think there’s a single person here that wants you to fail :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Love you and your content but this one was sort of lacking nuance imo
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not a good conversation if this part is left out because it is a KEY factor to most of the social and emotional behavior. As a gen Z myself it is all linked because it hard to make any decision, or think about the future at all when you dont have a hand to play with. Most people my age feel doomed like there's no point in even playing the game beyond surviving it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a regular viewer who has already seen all the videos you’ve linked to already, I really didn’t mind you focusing on non-economic factors.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Bradleyplausse  same! but, she should have told the viewers that the video would not be discussing the harmful impact the economy is making on adulting genz at the beginning. no hate, but the economy makes a bigger impact than parenting styles to young adults, at least in my opinion.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People complaining about this completely skipped the part about us using trauma and unfairness as a shield against personal responsibilities. We say "It's harder to grow up because the economy sucks" and "Don't judge me because it's the government's fault", and while those are both important considerations, they don't help us get out of this. Yes, everything sucks and the world offers us absolutely nothing these days. I'm not saying it's fair, but consider that this crumbling world is a world we will someday inherit, and marinating in its flaws does not prepare us to repair it, nor does it facilitate personal developmeny or satisfaction. No one is passing down the key to the kingdom this time; we just have to take it, and do better.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @TalesGrimm  Odd comparison but the same is happening in gaming.  Years ago people gamed for fun, now the developers spend all their time making incentives and free gifts because these same "kids" seem to have no interest in effort without some sort of reward.  Hell most wont even collect things without considering the future value of it.  If they want a brighter future your advice is dead on, get off your butt and start making a difference.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Great video great response. Don't listen to the h8ters
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So many comments prove the emotional stuntedness happening. Nobody is denying the economic problems, theres nothing wrong with living at home to save, etc. The takeaway I have from the video is assessing the emotional issues (which are NOT gen z’s fault) of decision paralysis, delayed sense of responsibility, and expectation management. This is happening at all socioeconomic levels.   Feedback to discuss the economics a bit more is fine, but don’t let these children make you feel bullied Ashley. Great video, well presented. Here’s the hard reality folks: the victim mentality will naturally select you out of the gene pool, and leave more room for the rest of us. You can be fine with that or not, your decision.  - from a gen z
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jestahjava4255  why would victim mentality be related to gene pool? not arguing in favor of one obviously but this statement seems laughably baseless. Calling it "victim mentality" when the viewers commenting are just pointing out the blatant flaws of the video and the way the information was presented. You need to think for yourself and to not let others do it for you for once!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like the theme of the video has been a little lost here. It isn't about Gen Z achieving economic-based milestones like buying a house, having kids, or advancing in their careers. Like I said, it's about social and emotional milestones. Getting your driver's license is not about whether you can afford a car or not; it's about wanting to take on adult responsibilities. As well, settling into a long-term relationship is not about economics, and finding a path in life is not about landing your dream career job. The economy is hindering Gen Z greatly, but that wasn't what the video was about. I'm not saying they can't get jobs or buy a house because they were coddled as children. In the same way, I'm not saying they can't pick a life path because car prices have inflated past affordability. There is some overlap, as you can see in the video, but I was trying to lean on the mindset side of things, which is why economics only got a shout-out at the end.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @AshleyEmbers why would you have any desire to get your license when there is no car available to you to use or even practice driving? And you know that you will not be in a position to buy a car for 10+ years
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠​⁠ @AshleyEmbers  i feel you that those aspects were your focus for this video, however, its all connected, diabolically intertwined even, sadly, regrettably,  imagine if it weren’t ?!? 👀 🎉 but i digress,   most of what the video focuses on is secondary, or even tertiary, look at it this way, economic based milestones as u put, also have social and more importantly emotional impacts, say you’re the only one who hasn’t gotten a license because no one has an extra boat to practice in, or money for driving lessons w/mrs puff, and you gotta ask for rides everywhere or use your chevrolegs, or find bus and light rail routes which still require gas $ to bus pass pimp na mean? (How r u gonna look em up with no phone, computer, or interweb?!)  But lets zoom out a bit, forgive me for putting in the details as i imagine them lol but okay from any lens yo, rational, logical, hell even number crunching, budgeting conscious, accounting class nerd type, unbiased analysis of, we might be fqked, it to take a very long time, lotta lotta cash/credit/debt, everything that economic based milestones NOW require (like anything and everything else now REALLY) and, still, 1 job two jobs, schooling, three jobs/side gigs that also become main gigs cuz still take time money energy and effort to do and recover from instead of rest or relaxation, and one could say with certainty even acknowledging that some or all economic milestones may not EVER be achieved, and if one has done that, has crunched the number, wrote it down, thought it out, and see, see it for what it is, that its not as CRAZY as maybe we friggin hoped it would be, because it IS crazy…it’s insane how uncrazy it is…  that that may very well be the case, for a lot of us, regardless of generation regardless of, anything else really, we’re more alike than not, even the 1% has ITS 1% ! Imagine ?!?! We have more in common and take any look see, its not looking good, by anyb measure, any analysis, any aspect of life today, here or anywhere, and the rest makes sense, iced coffeees & avocado toast anyone? =‘] it doesn’t cost a mortgage or rent and im way more sure about qualifying for 1 and no wait, get them today ! 🎉 🥳 🧊 ☕️ 🥑 🍞🥹🫠👍  (from conspiracy theory to conspiracy fact, or, you know, regular conspiracy (meaning true/real, a real plan, a scheme that occurred or is occurring)  because 2 or more people conspiring IS by def a conspiracy, where 2 or more parties plan or agree to do something USUALLY in a nefarious manner and usually for personal [corporate, special interest, lobby, gov, organized religion/education/media etc] gain, at everyone else’s expense, again, its crazy how NOT crazy it is, and because they’ve been doing it for so long, and efforts, MASSSIVE efforts to “ill make it legal” - sith, they kind of dont even really need to hide it, and sometimes like one of my fav movies The Big Short, why would they confess? Theyre not confessing, theyre bragging ! (The Other Guys, mark walberg and will ferrel touches on that too, wall st and corporate corruption and coverup and hijinks too!)  For anyone thats interested a good place to start is endless currency debasement with the Federal Reserve™️ Act of 1913, titanic, list of remaining countries WITHOUT Rothschild controlled banks (yet), and “The Collapse of The American Dream Explained in Animation” here on YouTube, i think its by doctordude https://youtu.be/mII9NZ8MMVM?si=ZanjQUInNu_eNjzL ? 🤷 that one’s good, and goldandsilvers’s “The Biggest Scam of History of Mankind - Hidden Secrets of Money Ep4, https://youtu.be/iFDe5kUUyT0?si=E85TDimbJW-LBEwl is also a doozy, and, painfully true. Just be ready, and it can be confusing, and thats on purpose. (Spoiler alert, the Federal Reserve™️ isnt federal and has no reserves…what a name eh? See: fda,fbi,epa,cps,cdc, damn near all of em…a lot of what it is, or i guess ISNT, is in the name, and thats by design too, think Totally Legit Enterprises LLC, lol im gonna copy paste this as a regular comment feel free to reply to either 🤷 hope you’re all doin alright, even if you’re not, thats ok 2 =‘], dont get me started on ghost jobs/ghosting, peace)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @AshleyEmbers hey ashley. if the theme of the video was lost on the audience it was made for, then im sorry, but the video wasnt done well. i understand what you were trying to do but the way you did it made your argument fall apart. a person's mindset and their ability to to even meet social and emotional milestones is heavily influenced by economics, which in turn, also AFFECTS said person's mindset and abilities. gen z's ability to meet certain social and emotional milestones which you are saying is the topic of the video, is only possible if/when the playing field is even remotely level. which it's not. bc of economics. so the theme isn't working.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, I graduated highschool in 2023 and most of the people around me were overachieving zombies. They sat in the class, did everything they needed to do, did extracurriculars so they had a higher chance of going to a good college/good scholarships,  worked a few hours to pay off their phone bill and got home at 10. Some teenagers I knew got six hours of sleep and got up at 5 to workout before school. I could barely function getting 8, I don't know how they did it. I feel like everyone after freshman year suddenly matured into 30 year olds with lots of experience, I think to get good grades and good scholarships/acceptance into college, along with the pressure from teachers and parents to stop being "lazy" and act mature, so we can have opportunity.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @buvkyy  yeah I'm 20 graduated HS in 2023 and still feel like a 11 yr old I'm trying but nothing changes but I'm doing things I try to like honestly I feel comfortable unemployed where Im at but at the same time Isolated or lack of money and idk but I'm grateful even though this economy is horrible and makes me wanna be part of a revolution lol but yeah im just living my life
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And it's all economically driven. You either choose the former and don't fret about how you live or, if you want something resembling economic stability, choose the latter. It isn't like sitting in the middle achieves anything beyond busywork. The gap between how much money you have and how much you need to get above water is comical.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just throwing in my two cents as a 20-year-old Gen Z living in Australia (not the US).  I’ve got my licence, I’m juggling two jobs, and I’m currently studying at uni. On average, I work about 25 hours a week, split between data work at a hospital and shifts at Subway.  The reality is, I feel like I have to work this much just to have a shot at a decent future. Sure, I know people say you can take it slow—enjoy your 20s, then think about settling down in your late 20s or early 30s. But honestly, it feels like if I wait that long, I’ll either fall behind or just end up in the same rat race as everyone else my age.  Where I live, house prices are through the roof. Even saving up a 20% deposit could mean scraping together $60–80k for a 40-year-old place that needs renos. It’s disheartening knowing things have been gradually declining for decades, and from where we stand, they’re not looking like they’ll improve anytime soon.  We were brought up being told, “If you work hard, you’ll get there”—that one day we’d be able to afford a home. But look around—how many 25–35-year-olds (even people in their 40s) are still trying to break into the housing market? It’s getting worse, not better. And it makes you wonder… if things are only going to keep sliding downhill, what’s the point in trying so hard?  So many people in my generation have already resigned themselves to throwing away their dreams in exchange for short-term comfort. Constant access to dopamine through social media, internet addiction, not bothering with school or seeking meaningful work—it's not laziness, it's survival in a system that’s felt rigged from the beginning.  We’ve grown up under the pressure of impossible expectations while being handed fewer opportunities. We’re the product of a society that changed the rules, then told us we just weren’t trying hard enough.  I’d genuinely love to hear your thoughts on how you’d approach teaching or guiding my generation. What makes some people grind through the system, and others give up or tune out entirely? Is it upbringing, luck, resilience—or something deeper?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The traveling sports fit into this category, families don’t even spend time together anymore in wholesome ways, because of the constant grind
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Let me give my perspective as someone in college: it is terrifying trying to enter adulthood these days. Not because Being an adult is the problem, it's the ability to stay afloat. I could drive, meet friends for bowling, watch friends, or whatever 20 yr olds 20 years ago did. But the problem is that trying to live that life now without prep is suicide. Getting a career as the economy shuts down EVEN HARDER than 2008 while bots moderate your resume, and the economy slowly prices working class people out of the market to preserve stockholder value, you feel like a caged animal where the only opening from the cage is entering into a hellscape. Some people are willing to resume build, and would have done that earlier had they been given the opportunity, others simply see both and drift bc it feels useless to kiss ass and denigrate yourself instead of enjoy the nothing you've got. But neither should be unexpected
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a teacher in Germany and it's the same here. But I also think, that growing up is depending on how you see it, a bad thing now. If growing up only means that you're feeding the machine, it's not desirable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the way you word that makes it sound like the future is gen-x redos & even more formerly-gifted-children 😭  (nothing but compassion from me for all of gen-z; capitalism & social media has taken a godamn horrendous toll to every generation alive right now)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i hit burnout at 16 as someone in the latter group. so glad i'm finding the balance of being ambitious and aiming high and being kind to myself now. i'm 19 and hopefully studying physics at uni
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a highschooler right now who wants to give her two cents with no direction in life except my love for art and psychology and wanting to be known for it… I’m so glad SOME adult understands. My dad has this sort of pressure on me to figure out an exact path of what I want to do but I just… can’t. I know very well that he had it harder during his young years but life just feels too difficult for me to jump into the rat race myself and fight to be known. It sucks, and I just want to be known for my stories and characters.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wow I couldn’t have said it any better myself as a fellow teacher you see the students clamoring for something anything but often times rather they numb themselves by doing nothing in search for something, or lie to themselves by trying to do everything in search of something in either case they end up even more empty.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s the current state of the economy that makes us as GenZ not want to branch out. We can’t keep afloat on our own, every thing is too expensive, food, rent, car payments, gas prices. You either have to be working constantly and have multiple jobs. But even that isn’t enough. So many of us would rather stay at home in stability with our parents. But we also don’t have any means to really leave. I’m thankful that I am with my fiancé, we just got an apartment, but we wouldn’t have been able to do it alone.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: wow i hate that i agree and fell into the latter group as i aged into early adulthood. Born in 96 and by the time i was 21 the resume building had zapped every ounce of me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a parent this is very helpful to know. I want to prepare my kids for the reality they will face as adults but i don’t want to overwhelm them, i have suffered from burnout and depression and would hate to bring that upon them. Such a hard thing to balance
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Omg the second one was me during high school and now I’m in the first category having graduated 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Their own expectations" the worlds, you mean. Since i graduated high school it was ALWAYS "we are all trying to get as close to 100% as possible" as our primary goal because the idea is theres no excuse, the only limit is how hard you can work. And so for my generation the disabled are the first to drop because its all just 'do it perfect til you fail or die then get replaced by someone else"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And the thing is that neither of these groups ever get to "grow up." The former have no desire to grow up because what good is that going to do for them. It will just shatter the alternate reality that they're created. The latter never got to experience  the emotional growth and personal development necessary to be resilient because they are on a factory line of achievement that doesn't allow for any individuality or expression. At the end, both of them lose. My sister is the first category, and I fear that I will be the second one.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SwordSnapper289  I have no choice but to overachieve, and a lot of my peers are the same way. We have no support from family members and haven't since we learned how to drive. Once we got a car to drive to school and work, it was up to us to figure out how to pay our bills and gas and clothes. A chunk of the issues here are a lack of good parenting. They don't want to/can't provide their kids necessary things like winter jackets and glasses.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Funny I used to be the 2nd group then I burned out and became the 1st group later in my adult life. When from overachiever to “no fucking clue to do with my life”. It’s honestly frustrating and exhausting mentally even though I’m living right with my parents. I’m grateful for them cause idk what I would do without them. I lack ambition or sense of direction which really makes me feel worse.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im a history teacher at a public high school. Except for a few standouts, the entire generation has given up. 😢
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah I was part of the first group and I got out of high-school senior year without graduating because I literally had zero drive and I could see the Forest through the trees. I realized that I was probably the only person who did and it made me give up. Nothing is going to get better with just me alone and thats how I felt and how I still feel. Alone.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im a '99 gen z, and literally for as long as i can remember, i've been suicidally depressed. like literally my earliest in-motion memory (as in not a snapshot of a moment) is the night of my 9th birthday, typing up my first suicide note. the idea that gen Z are burnt out and depression is 100% the reality of the situation, and i can only imagine how much worse it got for everyone behind me. my experiences with tech were paced to my age in a way that felt manageable - i got my first nokia brick phone at 9 (most kids my age got them around 10-11), then used variations of that style of phone until i was 16 and leaving school. in my friendgroup at age 13, there was ONE kid with a smartphone out of like, 15 kids. that was average. now every single kid in a classroom has a phone and probably a tablet. the impact that alone has is genuinely immeasurable. my last year at school, they instituted a ban on taking photos on school property - within the same year we had an assembly about the topic of making deepfake p*rn of each other. years later, i attended a family funeral, and as the second-youngest person there at 20, i took my cousin outside for some air bc he was around 13-15. within 10 minutes of us leaving the adults behind, he pulled up a video on his iPhone of Elsa from frozen singing "F*ck my ass!" dubbed over let it go. at a FUNERAL.   i'm entirely unsurprised that my generation is full of depressed aimless wanders and burnt out overachievers, theres nothing on offer for any of us anymore. the impact that tech had on us was mostly negative, and i say that as someone who's terminally online and has been for over a decade. i've never had any direction in life, any wants or desires, and whenever i tried to voice that to adults as a kid/teen, i got told off for being "negative" and "being contrary" instead of being listened to and helped/guided. i also grew up with a decent amount of freedom and support to develop independence and confidence, but without any desires or goals, what's the point of it? i dont want to be independent, i want to not be here anymore!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is why you focus on your own aspirations kids. What good is an A grade in your geometry class when you don't care about geometry? Even then, you could learn much more at home than at school.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @retroreview6178  With respect, we have a generation of students focusing on their own aspirations. They are all acting crazy in public and filming it for tik tok because views are what they value. Maybe taking them out of school isn't the answer...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The drive to perfection is because of the fear of being ridiculed by others. People nowadays, most prominent is the generation that grew up in era of social media live in day to day basis in social media. And sharing their opinions there is opening the chance of being ridiculed. The life without social media is lonely if you became active in it for years. It's like you know your friend is being in a party and you outside. The party is shit, people are shit, but that's the only place you can belong to.   I have been born in 2005 and I don't know if I'm still belong in the generation talked here yet I can still remember the time where people can interact outside.    And also punching someone is possible outside. Yes it's bad and we should find other ways to regulate our emotions, but being in a negative "party" everyday without the choice of punching someone can drive someone nuts.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This precisely is what concerns me most of Gen z and why I actively cringe when they're mentioned. They want to skip the process of adulthood completely and exceed In every possible way to avoid ever making a mistake and dealing with it's consequences, which is how most people grew up.   It seems good at first that they act this way....until you see how repetitive and "generic" the mindset is. Like @buvkyy mentioned, they're "zombie" like...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a cop, and outside of dealing with gen z and a's behavioral worst I had limited expirence with them until we got some high school interns from a career exploration program for students. Almost all of them were like you Said, straight up zombies. When you could actually get them to open up and start talking you heard like others had mentioned, they planned on excelling so hard that they never struggled and couldn't even put together a loose idea of how they were gonna make that happen 😂.  This one kid in particular said "if I don't make it in college sports I'm gonna go be a welder or engineer" so I said well you must be good at math then if you're gonna be a engineer. He literally said "oh I'm terrible at math...engineers gotta do math?"😂. So then I said we'll maybe welders better, you can make a great living as a welder but be careful alot of them spend every cent that comes in when they get those big checks and before they know it they are too old to be out on the pipeline and don't have much to show for it other than bills. He responded with "oh na I was gonna get me a new truck and all, what's the point of having money if you don't spend it 😂. But as we started taking some calls he started looking like a kid  seeing things for the first time
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: EXACTLY!! Especially the part where you can’t make a mistake. You can’t be yourself, you’ll get pressured into the norms of everything you see on social media; you can’t make a mistake, it’ll be broadcast all over the internet. It’s an awful environment to grow up in.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This may be a bit uncouth but I am a 2002 gen Z who was given absolutely everything by my parents who expected me to succeed. I am naturally gifted in learning, and I always have been, but due to burnout in two STEM fields that I’ve gotten years into, I have no idea what I’m going to do. I went from Chemical Engineering to Computer Science/ Mathematics majors, but now I live at home. I have no social life, I take online college while working full time as a sous. I am achieving, but you’re incredibly right, i am jaded. I’m not happy about any of this, I’m not happy about my majors anymore, I don’t engage with my hobbies because I don’t have anyone to engage with left. All that is left is work, and not fulfilling work either. I had to grow up early, I was taking college classes amongst AP when I was 13/freshman in highschool, completed calculus 2 by 16, the only time in my life that I had meaningful interaction was a short two months between the end of highschool and beginning of college where I could be with my friends. Now I start my day at 4:30 in the morning and finish studying by 10 or 11 if I don’t have any extraneous obligations. All this and I’m in debt with the only reassurance that I’ll be okay because I’m “achieving.” I don’t have any career prospects, I’m so tied up daily that I can’t afford an internship. The problem I face is that I’ve been doing this too long, I’m tired, I don’t want to be expected of these things.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @UltimitShadelord  I'm feeling something and was born in the same year as you, would you be open to talking??
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah I feel like we have more of an apathy problem rather than never wanting to grow up. To be honest most of the attitude comes from being taught over and over that our efforts are meaningless.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You have said it exactly how it feels. The only thing I would add, is the amount of trauma we have with actually having full access to the internet, the environment of domestic terorrist attacks and school sh00tings, and now we're watching our neighbors get nabbed by masked ICE agents.  Like... this is kinda a nightmare. And honestly? We're coping the best we can.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fully agree. The video implies that every Gen Z has an inherent personal problem/delay in life. Odd and I believe inaccurate.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I wouldn't say its not vaild to hate on teens (depends on how you hate on us) because alot of teenagers have been doing alot of stupid stuff (the Minecraft movie shit is an example of that) but it is sad how we cant go nowhere without a parent around
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Society has hated teens since the 80s what are you talking about. This is a very defeatist attitude and I was born into poverty and worked hard in my life
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Frosty1026 good for you… nothing has gotten better
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Frosty1026 yes teens have been hated since the 80s, but teens had more freedom in the 80s. Teens could be out all day and explore the world around them on bikes or driving with a groups of their friends, they could work a minimum wage job and still make a decent buck and buy themselves some decent entertainment, food, trinkets, clothes, etc. they could be in public spaces and skateboard or just hang out without having the cops called for trespassing and loitering, I’d also argue that in the 80s kids could get into some trouble or fail without serious repercussions that could severely affect your life going forward. Teens today have none of that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I tried to apply to, among other things, my local post office. I was told I 'wasn't qualified.' To sort mail. A job that literally only requires the ability to read, which I have.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @dapperdapps post office jobs were hard to get for us at your age too. Economic pressure related, like yours, so our rejections were also shallow arbitrary rejection excuses and not any really any indication of skill set. Whole economic system is a mess for everyone.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @dapperdapps The post office is a government job and you have to pass a real government background check. But they don’t just hire anyone for there because you do need specific requirements of job skills to get the job because it’s not an easy job to “mail sort” as you would think. I know this because I once a long time ago looked into this, talking 10yrs ago and out of curiosity.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @dapperdapps yes thats a federal job.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why does Gen Z not want to work? Because the free market doesn't want them to. Who are they to argue against the infallibility of the free market?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @DiasporaDoomer  I still don’t have a problem finding a job and most of my friends and we’re all gen z
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I applied at Dairy Queen and at the time I was doing adult education classes. They had both morning and night classes so I discussed my availability around those times and they said, "We are unable to work with you on your school times." Despite 90% of their staff being high schoolers...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @wallowa_sc that makes sense. They were looking for someone to work the hours the high schoolers couldn't. I'm wondering what you're trying to say here. It sounds like one time a fast food place told me they needed hours I wasn't available. Totally not noteworthy in a job search conversation. This is something people expect to hear many times, nbd.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You were the wrong color for McDonald's probably
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Forget a job interview they would give us the interview itself such a fake world
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You’re exactly the kind of person this video is talking about btw :/
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Late response, but depending on what job you had in the past, if you had a White/Blue collar job (a career that required at least a high school diploma), you can be overqualified for most minimum wage jobs because they can evidently tell that you can do better than the minimum wage jobs (those are moreso for people that see this as their only 1st job or previously only worked minimum wage) and believe that you're throwing away your financial future.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That’s a you problem I never had a problem getting hired I’m also a gen z myself so what are you on about?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Probobakt bc of scheduling needs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why would you prefer to work for McDonalds instead of starting to learn a trade?  I did and I'm self-employed. Whining about your bad choices isn't going to help you. BTW  -  there's no shame in living with your parents.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​​ @excommando1 Tell me a single "bad choice" I've made except for having the gall to apply to that place. I should have worked at the mines at 16 instead of going to highschool, should've started investing in crypto when I popped out of the womb. Should've done formal education and on-the-job training to learn a trade, despite already being in full time education which gets me declined from doing any apprenticeships or be qualified enough to even be trained in a field (jobs don't really train you anymore, but even if they did, they'd require someone who has previous job experience in that field or graduated school with that field qualification, which I'm too young for that). It's a never ending cycle, I'd probably have better luck with a car but surprise! I'm too poor for that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@excommando1 if he went out and improved his own situation instead of whining about it he wouldn't be a liberal, not to mention 21 years of public education has taught him that agency and taking care of yourself Is wrong
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sorry if you got rejected from McDonald's that's a you problem. Don't get me wrong, the job market is absolutely ass but McDonalds??????? Getting hired at  grocery store took only sending in my resume and I got a call the next day. No experience, still in Highschool. 16/hr. Indiana. My second job was one that required a bit more experience, and I got hired same day as the in person interview. 14/hr and only a Highschool degree. Look, what I'm saying is you can't blame you being off-putting on the horrible job market.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Velociraptor449  lol survivorship bias
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Velociraptor449  off-putting?? Dawg, I'm a teenage girl (I'm 18 technically but still), I don't think I could even TRY coming across as unsettling at a job application of all things
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Velociraptor449  you’ve pretty much just said “I had luck finding employment so you just must be off putting” very helpful, you’re part of the problem
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is such a weird problem, & it's pervasive now.  My boss had job candidates trying to vet our authenticity before applying, & thought they were weird.  I had a hard time convincing her last year this was a real issue candidates were dealing with, but now its spread enough to finally get news coverage.  Its not just screwing & depressing job seekers, Id guess at this scale its also skewing the data on employment in general-  young people are yelling out the problem (like its not uncommon for a grad to apply to hundreds of listings to get a single interview, then find out even that position isn't available), but the old uber-capitalist d£ckheads in charge can point to stats showing 'plenty of great open positions listed & unfilled'.   This backs up their fallacy that "young people just don't want to work"... so they can continue to screw them to pad profits, rather than take apart & repair the corrupt system enriching them.    Im gen X, in the 90s I used to think we were on a path to a peaceful cultural evolution.  Now I think we are more on a path to direct revolution... the 'get the torches & burn down the castles' type.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah something is going to erupt in some manner
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Lisa-Simpson-i3i  do we even have the energy for revolution?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's true about the fake listings. I went to just, try to get a job at Long John Silvers, the restaurant, and I asked if they were hiring and they said they "already did" and that they weren't taking applications and that their manager just told them to keep the sign up. And I said that's false advertising, and they just said "no it isn't". Um yes, actually it is.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Google contracts/contractors can be soul crushing. You got this and I hope you find a better place to get ur money.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THIS!  I'm a millennial too.  I went to school, graduated, paid off the debt, and did all of the "right" things.  I got married, had a kid, and just generally worked really hard.  And I have been paid for all of that with failure.  It took 5 years to land my first good-paying job.  3 years after that, covid hit, and the cost of living surpassed my salary overnight, so all of the things I had been saving up for (like a house) immediately became unobtainable.  Shortly after that, my husband dumped me, my kid, and our pets onto the street.  I had quit my job a year earlier because his job moved him 3 hours away, and now I'm stuck living with my mom (again) and wondering how I'm going to buy groceries for the week because, once again, I can't find a job.  Honestly, I don't blame Gen-Z for being unmotivated.  I personally have to fight myself to do anything; I have no motivation at all.  It's not just that I have a fear of failure, it's that success has always been just out of reach for one reason or another no matter what I tried to do about it.  I'm tired of working so hard to stay so stuck.  No one should have to work so hard to fail.  And to add insult to injury, so many people blame me for the failures saying I should have chosen better.  Someone in my career field could have bought a modest home 30 years ago.  As far as I can tell, the only "better" choice I could have made in life was to be born 30 years earlier.  It's not really a great incentive to make success impossible to achieve and then blame the person struggling for not choosing a different impossible path.  And Gen-Z isn't stupid.  Part of the reason they can't choose is because they know that they will be slammed into the ground and blamed for their failure no matter what they do.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @fairywingsonroses  I'm sorry you've had to face all that! As someone who literally had to argue with the boss in order to land a job that only lasted two months anyway before, just to try to make enough to pay a storage rent, I definitely relate to being tired of trying kinda. I had to move almost 40 times in the past 7 years, and had basically gigs almost every time I even had work. This was difficult to adjust to after growing up in a family who owned multiple homes, lived in the same place before for 11 years, and had a dad that had had such solid work that he could afford our same lifestyle even when he had to lose his ability to work for a few years there. I had been on a track to own my own home by the time I was 24, but bc of the economy/ etc., I am now 33 and live on gov help. I get blamed a lot too, even as, by now, I've  faced everything from a job moving overseas, age discrimination that my past workplace has had to pay out a lawsuit for, workplace harassment, gender discrimination, a person following me from my workplace, a business of my own not working out, and a bunch of other things. Trust me, they have no idea what they are talking about when they judge you and act like you haven't tried. I hear you. Please don't give up, especially for your child. I hope the best for all of us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a young Millennial, I feel this, and I completely empathize with Gen Z and the world they came of age into, and now have to grind and find a way to support themselves. I've been looking for a stable job since 2023, after I lost it due to generative AI. No luck for me. And I swear, I see the same job roles and companies appearing every month, as if they're constantly hiring and firing people. Or the case of job ads that close applications after three hours, sometimes with only 27 applicants, sometimes with over 500. So many of us are screwed, so I don't blame the youth for feeling like giving up in advance.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeah i’m 24, and i have a decent job as a kitchen manager except that it’s at a local restaurant that’s shutting down soon so i’ve been actively job seeking for months at this point, and all i’ve gotten back are auto-response emails. i have my degree, im engaged, been paying rent since 18, i am very much participating in adulthood, and trying to enter the workforce outside of service industry (no shade to service workers though, it’s a hard and legit job), but it seems impossible to actually start a career in the thing i have an entire degree for, time to get my masters and hope for the best i guess. and i think this online chatter about how lazy my generation is just works against any of us that are putting in effort to do what they’re telling us to do, you really can’t please a capitalist.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That’s kinda me! I have a bachelors degree, got an ok job but I feel stuck. I want to move forward and make better money but I constantly get rejected for any job advancements.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: EXACTLYYYYYY I'M LITERALLY SAYING THIS IS WHAT THE JOB MARKET IS LIKE NOW LITERALLY NO ONE CAN GET EMPLOYED THESE DAYS
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yea working for any company that has AI will replace you I’m glad I got a trade hard for AI to replace me and have a company lay me off
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THANK YOU! whilst I’m 26 next month so I’m gen z, it isn’t just a young adult problem and it isn’t that we ‘don’t want to grow up’. circumstances can genuinely PREVENT you from reaching milestones. for example when I was 17/18 when ‘everyone learns to drive’ I was too poor to learn to drive and I didn’t have a job as I was a college student and it would’ve cost in total about £2K to get driving lessons. I think sometimes being in certain circumstances, being stuck and confused or even still is mistaken as ‘not growing up’. sometimes what people need is introspection, to develop a sense of stability within themselves and life first before finding their place in the world. I agree some gen z are lazy, over-reliant and make excuses but most of the time, it’s not the case.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hear going to job fairs helps with that, but even then...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@ladyweirdo6035 I got a job at a job fair. There's a lot of good YouTube videos on how to take the most advantage and follow up. I still had to do 6 rounds of interviews but I did land the job. Best of luck to everyone! It's harder than it should be. 😵‍💫
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Tech is difficult. I would look into coding companies if you’re in code your skill set, try medical website coding. My last ex, last I knew, was part of the company that did the website for Express Scripts. Easy pay, easy work. Consistent too.  I’d pivot in that direction and apply for jobs like that, thar need coders!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I gotta say If you have a masters and have been unemployed for 5 years that's entirely a you problem not a job market problem.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel that moved out for a year,got a job was okay for while.But eventually was too saddled with debt and an eviction notice so I had to move back in with my parents.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jeremycampo5495 same here, but also wth is going on with the healthcare system? That’s the main reason I couldn’t keep the independence.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah she makes a LOT of videos about Gen Z and basically the point to every video is "Gen Z grew up too soft and can't do anything because they think pressure is hard" like 😭😭😭😭 yeah no Gen Z feels tired and hopeless because we see everything that the previous generations achieved doing half the work and getting more than anyone in this generation could dream to obtain even destroying themselves  Gen Z didn't care to get their license because who tf can afford a car???  Gen X and baby boomers are selling the houses they bought for 100k for 500k to Millenials and Gen z and reaping all the gains, they know its unfair and wouldn't want to be us, but it's "the way life is" and Gen Z has had it!! What's the point????? We have common sense and realize that there is more to life than labor  And now we're in an age where we have access to the whole world at our fingertips and can mature at an alarming speed because of that. When I was 18 I watched videos from Gen X discussing society and now I've heard so many perspectives. We've seen so many people live life and get so many outcomes. We just want to live happily  There's no uncertainty it's literally just that no path feels right because no path IS right, we've gone past the point of no return. Half of us are solemn and the other half are angry/in denial, trying to make sense of it/fall into line in the hopes that it'll work for them the same way it worked for everyone else
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @smokugoku  Right? It’s gotten to the point where I’ve actually decided to pursue my passion. Years before I would've told myself to be more “realistic” but being realistic isn't even an option anymore. So, now, I'm just saying screw it. I’d rather fail at doing something I actually want rather than be faced with regret for the sake of clinging to a corrupt system.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Some of the reasons cited in this video feels very cherry picked and doesn’t actually capture the real picture. For example when she mentioned fewer people with driving licenses; that could be attributed to many things like higher insurance for younger people, horrible car market, e bikes, e scooters.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @marty7335  That point in particular feels so odd to me as a european. "Having a drivers license opens up the world to you!" so does a walkable neighborhood and the nearest bus stop. I know that it's still very hard to get around without a car in many places, but when I was a teen in a city being able to drive was barely ever even a topic and we were still out and about.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same. I have a friend who is in a lot of debt and occasionally asks me for money because she just can't get by. She has been nearly homeless several times and has gone through so much, even health issues. On the flip side, I have another friend that lives with a roommate and has a good life away from home, but she makes over six figures so....lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, going to therapy isn't going to lower rent being over 2k a month.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @BOSSDONMAN and that therapy costs money too 😂 or the insurance for it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have a license but no car right now because it’s just too expensive the payments the gas the insurance. And then health insurance and medical care. I just listed like 1,500 - 2,000 a month of bills alone for me per month. If we had public transit and universal health care we would be such a wealthy people. This country is a nightmare.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I love how a lot of comments here are like "people who live in third world countries have it much harder and they grow up!" Bruh, I'm an immigrant. My family COMES from a third world country. Very few of my family their age have cars either. They either take public commute, have friends/family chaperone, or walk. When I visited, we literally took a taxi everywhere. The only one who's bought a house literally had to succeed as a doctor to make enough, and they needed a lot of help from the military to get a home.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: But the consensus for some reason is that we just dont want to have successful independent lives. I'm Gen Z. I graduated high school at 15. I painted both commercial and residential housing for 4 years without making enough money to support myself independently. I finally cut my losses at the beginning of this year and switched jobs and now hopefully have started a career with some mobility, but still I'm not making enough to support myself. I have worked full time since I graduated and have 2 semesters of community college completed. But yeah, my lack of independence must be due to a lack of commitment or a fear of having to "adult."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly! I’m a teacher working toward a pension, and I’m going to retire the literal second I can collect 100% of the benefit (30 years).  Some people think I’m lazy for looking forward to retirement, even in 30 years! I’m like… I’d be comfortable, not working whatsoever, and earning 2/3rds of my salary simultaneously. All while having regular vacations and decent-to-good benefits. It’s the whole reason I’m in this career!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: An attorney? Godspeed, I heard it is impossible to find attorney jobs nowadays
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Don’t follow society terms of success find your own success. Get into a trade or a degree that won’t be replaced by Ai don’t follow social media trends of success. Honestly I don’t live lavish I got a home a crappy car and have a happy life cause it’s better than homelessness that to me is success. You don’t have to be something big to feel successful
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's honestly scary when I think of my older relatives who worked their butts off, retired, but from their 60s onward they really couldn't do much because they were no longer in good health.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​Hence why young adults nowadays YOLO vacations and experiences when they "should" be saving and investing that money... only so much health can be salvaged from it later on, and the time only gets lost to make some interesting stories.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Finally someone older who knows what’s going on and doesn’t blame Gen Z for feeling burnout
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also I wonder if AI can do all these jobs and ppl do less overtime, or work time in their jobs, is that a possibility for our future generation? Cause like the old generation who had access to house, car, family everything using even the lowest salary they earn, they younger instead of these things like lower work time including me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It was the same for yiur generation... Arguably harder
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: oh my god this. my dad is the most miserable man ive ever met and he doesnt understand why i dont want to follow in his foot steps. he makes really damn good money but my god he has 0 free time. hes always working, and when hes not working, hes drinking away his misery. hes always stressed out. i dont think ive ever seen him happy. meanwhile i may not make a lot of money but im good at my job, i like my job, and i have free time to enjoy my life. financially i am strained but i honestly don't know if what he does is actually better than what i do. more money would be nice but the sacrifices made to get there are just not worth it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly.  Like… Why in the world would any of us want to shoulder the responsibilities of “adulting” when so many of the adults around us are extremely miserable or content with being extremely boring?  Or both?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ^^^ my dad was bum that didnt work and hated his life and my mum worked 16-18 hour days for my entire childhood and... Hated her life 😊 really makes me wanna get involved in this life shit
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It may seem questionable when you’re very young and don’t have too much on your plate but as life stressors increase as well as your needs, you’re going to need more money to get by in life.   Money for your home, a great job with benefits so that when something happens to you, you’re not kicked to the curb, money for a rainy day and to protect your future in case of emergency, or just in general, good food to keep you alive, and not just junk food that is not good in the long run.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's so true, I'm also 28 from Poland with bachelor's degree in psychology but because I couldn't find a job that pay my bills I needed to move back with my parents and start nursing school. I'm not lazy, it's the market job right here, if I could afford my own place of course I'd move out
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @BrunetteThoughts "I got a useless degree in a field that was known to be hard to find jobs in of my own volition but it's the economy's fault" fixed it for you 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: they don't have any economic sense... don't go out and buy a new car when you can't afford housing...  they also have unrealistic expectations about how quickly you should advance.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: .....what's your degree in?😂. Here I am 28 over employed and all my freinds are too, and only one has a college degree but all of my non degree holding friends make more, sometimes 3x more than the people I know with degrees. It's not the economy holding you back, it's your choices and your aversion to getting a real job that's not in an office.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Patson20  why do all tradies have such a complex lmao get over yourself
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I knew we were in for a rough time as a Zillennial when the adults I trusted brought in Kony 2012 hypebeasts to us in highschool and told us all we would change the world.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It'll happen for you. It won't happen right away, it might not even happen soon. But keep at it, I promise you, it WILL happen. You'll come out the other side.  Take it from a guy who spent his 20s and 30s as a manchild in many ways and still managed to come out the other end after 40. And I'm not the driven, ambitious, clearly got-their-head-on-straight type you are, so if I can do it, you can.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just wanted to say thank you for volunteering. :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nothing wrong with living with parents, shit only exists in the West  Most of Asia it's not an issue, if you either live with them or not. My father doesn't because of his job location, but his brother does even though they have a good stable job  It's only a western ideology. Also I get the car thing, public transport doesn't seem to exist much in the US for some reason. So, most of you have to kindof have a car.   Btw good luck for your masters :D
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey girl, do you wanna go on a date with me?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Have you tried to get roommates and other ways to afford things that’s life I can’t live on my own so I live with my wife rn but I had roommates for years and lived in Orlando a very expensive city. Sometimes it sucks but you gotta do what you gotta do to survive
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​ @Frosty1026 roommates aren't guaranteed to be good to you. They can be dangerous. Only do it because you need to, but otherwise, just avoid it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Frosty1026  what's the point of getting roommates if you're still barely scraping by?  it is financially smarter to live with your parents to save up money to pay off student loans, save for a nice starter home in the future, or even just do some occasional traveling.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Actually expired inspection stickers they can give a ticket, but if registration is expired, they can tow it and impound the car!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @rhimaginemua  Yep! Still a BS law that only exists to inconvenience people
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Actually the gen x'ers have also faced this problem from what I'm heard, they are only able to cope cause they could buy a house work however they wanted and run away from home to cope with the problem they deal
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @marinaabeach  I don't know what you're trying to say.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And yet the solution to fix all our problems has been well thought out and blueprinted by Jacque Fresco and The Venus Project for decades.  And yet people keep making these videos talking about these problems while simultaneously ignoring the solution that will solve the problems?  Are people insane?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The police state? I'm sorry but because your friend didn't pay insurance they got their car towed. Those rules have been in  place forever, and for good reason. Someone uninsured hits you, what happens, who pays?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @AnnaliseVolken  in any normal world it would be a warning or just a fine for a lapse in coverage. Turns out they did actually have insurance up to date, but they didn't have the card in their glovebox bc it got mixed in with someone else's mail.   It's the city's policy to tow for REGISTRATION and not insurance, tho. So go ahead and justify how that one's reasonable for me. Even if it's a day past expiration, they'll tow your car. Its a fine for being poor and then a kick in the shins on top of that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: too true, im also eastern european and i have 2 siblings, one of which has 2 phds and is extremely qualified for various jobs but is stuck working in an office for meager pay, and the other managed to get a job at a foreign company that has had at least half of its workers resign due to low wages and overworking. only one of my siblings lives alone and thats exclusively due to our grandparents dying and leaving their apartment (thats completely falling apart btw) to him. im currently unemployed and trying to get into uni but even with that i dont expect to find much work since im going for a very specific field and dont have many qualifications beyond it. the entire system is falling apart in front of our eyes and i have no clue what to do about it anymore tbh.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm British but I feel jealous of Eastern Europeans a lot because of the fact that they still have a chance at change.  Over here I'm less of a beacon and more an item for the goverment to continue to suppress and ignore our pleas for something to change for us.  At least Eastern Europeans have a chance at change over here we don't have a chance if zack polanski doesn't get to be pm in 2029.  I'm so fucking frustrated of my home country and I wish I was born in Eastern Europe so that my fucking voice can be heard for once in my life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @glowtail3744 sorry for the long comment, u can ignore it lol, i just thought that i should clear up the fact that eastern europe isn’t just a commie block n fog aesthetic n that it can be very difficult n frustrating to live here, especially since we’ve never really seen our countries prosper under democracy (or in general).   we’ve taken a long road only for the alt right rhetoric to spread thru europe like wild fire, we didn’t get an obama era or an actual economic prosperity, i mean, for instance, right after my country joined the eu in hopes of rebuilding itself n its economy the recession happened. n it hit us so bad, many of us only recovered financially around 2013/2014.   i can assure u that in eastern europe the government listens to u even less. in my case there hasn’t been one presidency or political party (in the government n the parliament) that hasn’t been disappointing or outright harmful for my country (plus it is widely known that votes are faked or bought by different parties or candidates) like last year there was russian involvement in our presidential election n we had to redo it (hoping that the alt right candidate didn’t win cuz he would’ve embarrassed us in international n eu politics, he already has in the eu).   n the corruption is not only way too strong n present but its also so visible, like no one even bothers to hide it. even in medical care there’s so much nepotism n bribery, same with the judicial system.   our government is also dismissing the parliament by abusing emergency ordinances (so they basically make their own legislation n apply it under the pretense of an “emergency”) n it already cut the salaries of the public functionaries even more.   that’s excluding the very present communist practices n nostalgia n i live in romania, which has evolved so much, yet its still so bad.   there are even more shitty situations like serbia which has had protests all thru 2025 cuz of the train station accident that killed ppl (n the government literally berated the protesters n the police beat them in the streets). hungary has a very anti eu alt right president etc.   n forget about being a minority here, if ur gay u better move to the three main big cities that are more diverse (yet far from genuinely accepting n expensive to live in, even with a good paying job) n prepare to potentially lose ur family for being urself. god forbid ur trans, cuz ur gonna have to look into forums n documents with a handful of doctors spread across maybe 5 cities who would consult u (doesn’t mean they wont berate u or try to convince u ur just confused), be prepared with a mental list of the perfect answers in order to get a letter of recommendation, look into the handful of doctors who would be willing to operate on u (in the case of chest surgery) even if its not their main field (usually they specialize in reconstruction not masculinization) or having to literally sue ur cities local administration in order to change ur documents.   n the schools n colleges are bad, even the good ones. u don’t wanna know what i heard some of my teachers say during lectures (im a history major)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 16:16 what do you think about that TikTok?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @UnGatoDeOro I don't know about the author of the comment, but as a fellow Eastern European, I want to pitch in.  Fear was a big part of my responsible behavior when I was a child. Corporal punishment is a big and normal part of parenting in many Slavic cultures. I remember being in first grade, and being asked by our teacher to raise our hand if our parents don't use corporal punishment. Two children out of thirty raised their hand, and I know for a fact that one of those two  also got corporal punishment very occasionally, maybe 3 times in her life by the age of 6.  I was folding laundry because I would be spanked otherwise. I was helping with dishes because I would be beaten and ridiculed and made fun of otherwise.   And guess what? I have the same struggle with growing up as the other older gen Z has (born 1997), and I think it's because of two reasons.  1)  Having more responsibilities as a child didn't transform into having more freedoms. Also, I didn't really learn how to stand up for myself, because even though I was left to deal with my own problems, I could never stand up to my parents because I would be beaten if I did. 2) the economy is fucked, the only single people I know who don't live with 3 roommates are people who live in a countryside and work remote, precisely as a cheap labour for some big tech company.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @UnGatoDeOro  I think that tiktok is complete bull. In my experience, americans are the ones who are overly strict to kids to the point of not letting them have privacy and making them get a job at 16. Where I'm from, you're expected to help put with chores, but that's it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also 24 here just graduated college in May and have been applying to jobs since before I graduated. The state of things is ridiculous right now to put it lightly I’m thankful to live with my parents still but I know they’ll kick me out at some point and they ask me every day about why I haven’t gotten a job yet. It’s exhausting and I feel you friend.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Genx I absolutely DISPISE those "personality" tests. They're bunk in my opinion. I've worked hard, never been in trouble, never been a their, ect. But because I have PTSD those tests make me out as a "bad" fit and have made me denied for many positions that I would have been great in. Ever since they became a standard part of job applications, I have struggled to find jobs. I used to be able to get job just by TALKING to management now it's basically impossible.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 2001 and 25 is getting kinda scary to think about
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I always lie and answer in whatever way I know the company would want me to answer. Y'all don't need to know the inner mechanisms of my psychology. If I show up and do my job well and get along with everyone that's the only thing that matters imo
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: my bf became physically disabled after the pandemic, and now I (25) am struggling real hard to find a job (any job), especially something that could support us both.. Im brazilian, it seems like this is a problem in the whole world
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you weren't aware personality assessments for most of those companies are really just racial tests for them to excuse preferential hiring. Ever noticed who primarily works at those places?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z here too. I LITERALLY start training  Tmrw. minimum wage; Paid every 2 weeks, 40 hrs/Full time. I have a Sinking feeling this won't even be enough to move out on my own.  even trying to find an apartment close Is a struggle, let alone the price for a Single.  And about those stories we hear from previous generations? Idk if anyone else has said it enough; THEY DON'T HELP OUR CASE. In fact I feel even worse about myself. I hear it so much, It's becoming the Equivalent of Showing off. I get it, you're Finacially stable and happy. No need to rub it in bro.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think maybe the commenter meant not necessarily that we work harder than older generations but that we are working hard and getting less and in that sense makes everything more hard work than it might've been in the past. It's absolutely no doubt older generations were hard workers!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah because your parents were pretty much losers they started this thing off being the generation got caught up into the social media thing Generation X escaped half of it because by the time it came about we were already developed teenagers and had social skills already. Social media didn't affect us or our goals we have always been the generation that can take it or leave it and preferably leave it! Because we experienced a world b4 social media and that life was better before social media. We are happier as a generation because we could care less about social media we don't need it and actually many of us think it's stupid
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: literally my parents (i'm indian and i did uni in the us) constantly give me shit for not pulling myself up by the bootstraps like they did but they literally just went to uni in the 80s and when they graduated their qualifications were so in demand that they immediately got solid entry level jobs that led to better and better promotions. meanwhile i spent entire years applying to unpaid internships and they didn't even have the decency to send me a rejection email. my grandparents straight up got their land their house is on in a lottery from the government. every single "entry level" job requires a bachelors and 5+ years of work experience and pays you 1/2 of what rent costs. like yeah everyone had to work hard but nowadays you can't even get a job without nepotism.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “Than any other generation in history”   I wouldn’t go that far- that’s very tone deaf.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @xSOLAx really shows how ignorant they are, maybe they should look up what the greatest generation went through. 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes, but a lot of especially blue collar jobs do have a record low unemployment rate. Jobs that, actually pay pretty decent… A lot of our generation could be doing more, and instead of taking responsibility, we love to blame others or the system. It is unjust, but what are we to do about it? Literally, people have been complaining and rioting about the same thing for decades. We aren’t unique, we’re just more stuck up. I’m not over generalizing, as I understand many are struggling. But the ones complaining proceed to do absolutely nothing to live below their means, requiring more.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's got more to do with your total lack of drive and defeatist mortality. The greatest generation for example faced an economic crisis several orders of magnitude greater than what we are facing, they grew up with the Spanish flu and polio rather than covid, watching their friends grow stiff and eventually not being able to move at all. Their job market was much bleaker too due to the afformentioned crisis and lack of labor laws we have today. They didn't have air conditioning anywhere,  no computers. And then just when they thought things were settling out they had to fight ww2. And did they sit around and tell the Japanese to just take whatever they want cause there was no hope of things getting better? No they fought, they volunteered and they created the economic situation that led to the boomers prosperity. And then there's you....their sad descendants
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh you work harder than any other generation in history do you? Sure, bud. I do agree that your generation got screwed big time, but making nonsensical statements like that make you sound foolish.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Justsomerandomguy1727  every gen has gotten screwed in some way but this gen literally has stagnant wages while houses cost 300% per cent more. This is unprecedented and proved by research.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Y'all don't work harder than anyone in history good Lord
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @killjoyredux8361 buddy I work 2 manual labor jobs which barely have any safety to begin with.  I'm both a mechanic and warehousing freight.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @killjoyredux8361  No, but this gen often has to work multiple jobs for miniscule pay. It is a fact, proven by research, that wages have not grown at all with the cost of living, for example, houses cost 300% more now but wages did not increase anywhere close to that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not to mention, technology is actually terrifying when it's paired with driving.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this! i told everyone i know that the NYC subway is basically just a walmart version of the London tube (& every other metro system i've experienced in my life). i STILL prefer it 1000x to the aesthetically pleasing but sterile and lifeless suburbs where most of the sounds you hear outside are just from cars!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As someone who's used the fabled European public transit.....my car is still much better and still somehow cheaper 😂. Also nobody is demolishing third spaces for parking lots or because of cars, you don't close a successful business for a peice of pavement. And your mental health isn't suffering because of cars it's suffering because you're on a nonstop doom propaganda drip from tik tok that's teaching you the terms you regurgitated here
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Patson20  You have no idea what you're talking about. I can't stop you from believing any of that though lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Patson20  If you think a car is cheaper than a bike or a bus ticket, then you really shouldn't be complaining about propaganda because yours is on a whole other level.  Also, wanting your streets to be safe for people who can't afford or drive a car isn't propaganda. The real propaganda is being scared of safe, walkable and cyclable cities for... literally no reason, no source written by angry people has provided an actual reason, I can only assume it's because it's change.  Also, you really need to read about the history of how the highways were made instead of just rejecting facts you don't like.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yea this video was really gross and tone deaf to me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: A good option would be part time, and rent a room with like 5 people so u can work life balance
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes bro the older generations are leading the younger generations to their downfall but we can't entirely blame them we have to keep trying even if all odds were stacked against us
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @marinaabeach  exactly. Maybe we didn’t create this mess but we got to make it better for ourselves.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not to be that guy, but what does "become an adult" even mean here? Doesn't everyone have like a different version of becoming an adult? We're literally doing what the other adults do: working. But for some reason, we love to avoid other adult stuff like creating a family, rather go partying or coping with fantasy thoughts, avoiding other responsibilities like the plague... Why are we suddenly avoiding "adult" things here? Isn't that literally what was said in the video? That we just have to accept the fact that we can't juggle a hundred things at once but actually have to do sacrifices here and there? Truth is, while we have it absolutely harsh in todays economy, there is literally stuff that we inflict on ourselves. We are too quick to judge when we have to give up stuff. But when we gain stuff? We don't question anything, at all. It's fine that we have a grip like with working, but we really gotta have a grip on other parts of life too, even if it means making sacrifices. Gotta stay strong, somehow, but I believe that we can do it!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Adeyum64  at the bare minimum, it's having a job that pays enough for you to thrive rather than survive, and owning property rather than renting.  buying a house is flatly impossible to all but the top 10% of Americans, as to even be approved for a loan, you need a salary of at least $150,000/y, and this is assuming no debt of any kind. that number gets significantly higher when you consider student loans and car payments, which are costs you can't opt out of. Not having a car means you can't participate in society due to infrastructure being car-centric, and Nobody will hire anyone without at least a 4-year degree due to the current downsizing of the Job Market.  Renting just makes you circle the drain and can often cost more than a mortgage payment for the same property would have been, but the vast majority of Americans are locked into perpetual renting because they'll never qualify for a loan.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So many countries are filled with people who struggle so much more than the average 1st world Gen Z. They still learned how to become adults. I'm not saying your generation doesn't face greater challenges than any other generation in recent history, but a bunch of you still have no resilience -- and for that I blame your parents.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Justsomerandomguy1727  You don't have to put down one person's struggle because another struggles more. Those people who struggle more and became adults earlier/ 'easier' often did so because they had no choice and the consequences of growing up fast due to negative circumstances/trauma is lifelong.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Justsomerandomguy1727 you say that as if quality of life in the “first world” isn’t degrading in real time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It hasn't. It's just that gen z sees any minor difficulty as an insurmountable struggle and expect everything to just be handed to them because they completed a checklist of going to college
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Patson20  speak with real people get off the internet
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That and driving is hecking scary lol.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That and part times “teen jobs” don’t pay for cars anymore, car insurance is ridiculously expensive, and a lot of parents are over protective and don’t allow their kids to do scary things such as driving to school and such
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Your parents sound lovely, you must love them so much and have such a great relationship with them 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @xandercrew6088 no way how can you tell 😂 I was almost shocked that they actually showed up to my wedding (not that they stayed the whole time especially when I announced that I was taking my wife's last name. They were not too happy about that since I'm the first born son)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This!! I was born in 96 so im right on that old gen z / young millennial line. Some of the points made in this video and the comments are just so ignorant of reality.   I never learned to drive in high-school because I grew up in extreme poverty with abusive drug addict parents. I was taking care of my 3 younger siblings completely on my own by age 8. I did all of the cooking and cleaning for my family of 6 and was the only parental figure in the house. At 8 years old. I eventually ran away as a teenage minor and had to survive without access to any of my documents like birth certificate or ID, making it extremely difficult to get a job or get by until I was 18.  Even when I was back in high-school in like 2012 hardly anyone had a car. Ive moved a lot and went to 4 different high-schools. Ive never actually had a friend who's parents bought them a car. There were always just a select few kids with vehicles in school, and everyone knew those were the rich kids.   Every single one of my friends comes from a similar background. I literally don't know anyone my age who doesn't have CPSTD on top of everything else. Its kind of hard to have "hopes and dreams" about the future as a minor when your stuck in an abusive hell hole. being beaten, molested, verbally and emotionally abused and then parentified on top of all that.   Everyone i know comes from broken homes. I dont know anyone my age or younger that has a good family support system.    Our parents generation insisted on popping out as many kids as possible as fast as possible. My parents could never afford the 4 kids they had but that didn't stop my mom from popping out a new kid every year. Our parents had us when they didn't actually want kids. We were not "coddled" into this.   And on top of it all we dont even know if there will be a world for us to live in 20 years from now. Between American politics, literally ongoing genocide, the growth of AI, the severity of climate change, running out of natural resources like gasoline and clean air and water. Our world looms on the brink of world war 3, mass climate destruction and total economic shut down. The Trump administration already gutted FASFA and student loan programs for the poor. So tell me how exactly am I supposed to pursue higher education now?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i completely agree with this. As other commenters have said, much of this video is in bad taste and just out of touch with the actual issues most of us face.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly. There is also the issue of all these people saying "gen z this", lumping them all together without realizing it's not so cut and dry. Those born from like, 1997 to ~2004/2005, had a very different experience than those born in 2010.  The "pioneers / initial Gen Z'ers", which are their own group at the start, did not grow up with a tablet/screen in their face. They got to play outside, groups of bikes laying in front of a house, watching / experiencing the "old / previous" way-state of life-society, and seeing the beginning of the extreme change that was in motion as the phones/screens/tech began to release, expand, become more ingrained into everything and then start corrupting all things in the world...  All of which, creates a pretty significant gap/experience for this initial grouping, compared to those born in the later the timeframe.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Your life isn’t any harder than the people who came before you. Or other from a third world country. Fight for the life you want.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @HeadHigh407 never said my life was harder. Just explaining how it is different
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a millennial who grew up in poverty in an abusive household. This isn't an excuse to use. I started working as soon as I could, held supervisor positions since I turned 18, couch hopped to stay out of the situation I grew up in. There were weeks I ate nothing but ramen and had 2 pairs of clothes. I dug myself out of it. I'm finally in therapy in my 30s, getting my PTSD treated and saving for a house. I get to watch everyone spit in my face about how hard life is after I put in the work and determination to change my situation. We all have it in us to make a better life for ourselves. Don't be afraid to fail. Take risks. Tell yourself you're worth a better life and go for it. I spent the last 2 years showing a gen z friend that he could do it, too, and he is thriving now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @evamei9030  I've never even held a proper position, we are not the same, you struggled to save, people entering the workforce now are struggling to EARN.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @evamei9030 u want a medal? Any time anyone talks about how society is different today older generations always sum it up to “making excuses.” There is a huge difference between saying “due to these circumstances we have no chance and should just give up” versus simply explaining why Gen Z may be “behind” by previous standards.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a gen Z (22), I wasn't coddled at all, actually quite the opposite. My parents were addicts and neglectful me, and my brother had to bounce from friends house to friends house to relative to relative being homeless multiple times in my life I helped raise my younger brother i started working as soon as i turned 16 while other kids were wondering which colleges they'd go to i already gave up im terrified of being in debt (luckily my credit score is good) but i never feel like an adult even now and i dont wanna work minimum wage my entire life but i can't do college and also pay bills, rent and gas at the same time i feel stuck and honestly have no idea what to do
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: All of this has to do with the economic state the US is in. No teenagers want to drive because car payments are insurance are through the roof. 25 year olds can’t buy houses because of how expensive the housing market is right now, let alone renting. Can you blame us? We stay on our phones because doing anything else requires money we don’t have.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Older gen z here. Even with financial and emotional independence from my parents, and a bachelors degree, I’ve spent the majority of my 20s LONELY. STARVING. LET DOWN. I have no sense of justice and no sense of self. I’m just a cog in the rat race and it’s beaten me down to where I can’t get up. What’s the point of doing anything for myself if I’ll just be used and discarded like I have been with my employers and university. What’s the point? Living to die. That’s my generation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m getting tired of blaming each young generation for their failures or for failing the economy or whichever. The economical and political barriers aside I want to hear SOLUTIONS. How do we overcome these issues and make the lives we want? How do we build community and beat the system? How to we build our own safety nets so we can feel free to take those risks?  I feel like partly because we live in a world with all of the information at our fingertips, the accurate information or even information that would actually help is harder to find or we don’t know what questions we should be asking to get that information. It’s a “unless you know someone who knows, you’re gonna not realize you have these tools at your disposal” situtation. Telling Gen Z how much they suck isn’t actually going to help them or Gen Alpha to succeed, it’s just going to reconfirm that they aren’t capable of doing this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeahhhhh.... Nah. Maybe it's because I'm gen z myself, but I don't think this video accurately reflects the problems we face with gaining independence. Our problems are not that we weren't given enough responsibilities when we were young, or that we were too coddled, our problems are that we were told that all we needed was to go to college and get a good education and pick out a career for ourselves and then when we emerge onto the world we're struck with how absurdly expensive college is, how hard it is to get a well-paying full time job of any kind. Not even in the field we might want to go into. Our problem is that we can't risk taking risks because if we fail we don't have the money to pick ourselves back up.  I want a career in animation, I want to write for kids cartoons, storyboard scenes, create interesting and unique characters, but how am i supposed to do that when college is ridiculously expensive and corporations are trying to replace artists with AI? What prospects do I have in a field where artists are already struggling so much there's literally a term for us and then the economy starts taking a nosedive? I live in america where real human beings are being treated like animals and I'm supposed to try and make my first steps into the world?  You're trying to ignore the state of the world but the state of the world is so intrinsically tied to this issue that it makes you sound out of touch and like you're trying to make excuses. It's those darn overprotective parents! They're why everything is so paralyzing right now, so please don't look at the economy! I haven't seen your other videos but you seem like a very thoughtful, reasonable person so I doubt that was your intention. Unfortunately, intentions don't change anything about the video. What we have is what we have, and I think it's a poor take on the problems Gen Z faces.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an older Gen Z myself, it truly feels like you are completely out of touch with us. Some of what you said absolutely holds some truth, but a lot of it just felt like you've never talked to a Gen Z person in your life, as well.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Having drive is hard these days. I have tried to start my career three different times now. First time, company fired all it's "entry-level" (see: 15 an hour, 4+ years of specialized experience) employees. Second time, DOGE cuts fired all new employees for my field (data security), and third time, got hired for a week, then fired because the company is seeking new avenues (We got replaced with AI). I got a degree in an in demand field. I worked my everything off to be able to get through with no debt being told this was the field to be in. Not anymore. Replaced by AI. Now I have to restart my life. Again.  If I were lucky, I'd get a blue collar job, but I have MS and can't handle physical labor due to troubles with my spinal cord. It's hard to maintain drive when you keep being thrown to the wayside and told it's your fault for having the wrong kind of drive. The best I can get is working at a bagel store for $12 an hour. Can't even rent a place on that, it's miserable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So crazy how in the beginning of the video she says that gen z can’t convince ourselves to make the first step out into the world and grow up. Last year me and my bf (both gen z) worked two jobs each. We still could not afford a mortgage on a small house in the cheapest, worst area in our city. Even with 4 incomes between the two of us, we could not do it. Especially when you factor in other expenses like car insurance, phone bill etc. So instead of killing ourselves, we both went back to one job for now since the “no days off” life wasn’t doing us any good anyway. I’m offended at this idea that “we don’t have any drive.” Crazy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s taken my niece two years to get a driver’s license. That is wild to me. The hesitations, the driving school requirements, multiple exams and test drives, the expense of insurance and getting a hand-me-down vehicle, etc.  I practiced driving with my mom, took the tests at the DMV, was gifted an old car by my aunt, and was a danger on the road carting around my friends within 6 months. We were considered poor, too. I bought my sister a car for $500 from saved up summer job money — a job that paid me almost the same wage in 2003 that I was offered for my first job out of college in 2013, despite inflation and much higher job skill and degree requirements ($9/hr vs $11/hr, and that was the best I could find). 😐 Times have changed. Never would have realized how lucky I was to be a teenager before everything became totally unaffordable in the US starting with the housing bubble of 2008.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a 20 years old Gen Z, I think it's unfair to compare us to the people who lived back in the 1950s. While they could get a degree, get a driver's license, buy a house, support their family and happily retire, the opportunities are more scarce for us Gen Zs.   Currently I'm studying in college, and even though I've been actively searching for jobs since high school, I still can't seem to land one. There's less entry-level jobs, resumes are being checked by the AI, and most jobs tend to pick the experienced ones. Some of the people I know had to either use nepotism, or simply lie on their CVs to get a job. And that's why many of the Gen Zs are having issues with moving out, getting a driver's license or "adulting". It's just expensive.   I can't get driver's license because it costs over 2k usd, I can't move out because it means I'll have to take on student loan. And how are we also expected to have kids, if everything is either expensive, uncertain, or many are facing the difficulties of finding a decent job and partner?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Love old people who can't just admit it's the freaking economy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ive adulted very well until now. Always maintained a full time job. Worked overtime, contributed to retirement, have a good credit score. No debt.  Now Im 24. Burnt out, tired a lot, depressed and sad all the time. I was young. Tried to get ahead in life playing a game that was rigged from the start.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 0:20 to be fair to this guy, i moved out of my parents at 22 for job in a city I had never been to and I ended up moving from that city after a year to be close to family. Do not feel rushed to leave home, you can save a ton of money once you find a job and be able to buy your own home while most of your friends are still paying rents for apartments.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 22 and if I’m being real I don’t really see anything to grow up into. Everyone keeps saying I need to get it together, find a path, become an adult—but for what? The world feels like it’s falling apart, and all the things I’m “supposed” to work toward don’t even seem worth it. A job that drains me? A house I’ll never afford? Bills on top of more bills just to survive? It’s hard to feel motivated when the future looks like a dead end, and honestly, I’m tired of pretending that any of it makes sense. It’s not that I don’t care—I just don’t see the point in growing into a system that feels so empty and rigged.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like we need a follow up that delves more into the economic side of things.   As a Gen Z myself, I know the one thing that has kept me from feeling like I am stepping into adulthood is the job market. I've been out of school for 3 years, and the only jobs I've had have been part-time/temp positions that don't offer benefits and of course don't pay very well and have no opportunities for advancement. Full-time work feels so out of reach because it takes hundreds of apps just to land a handful of interviews. My degree feels useless, like everything up til now has been a false start, as though the workforce won't view me as a whole professional until some arbitrary milestone is met. How is anyone supposed to feel like an adult when every job wants to treat you like you're back in high school working part-time in the summer?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wait, wasn't this the criticism Millenials were facing?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I somehow managed to live alone for a year as a student, but that was without eating out or going anywhere. My life is so boring and empty that I don’t know what the point of it even is
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: From what I experience as a Gen z person, its not just people not wanting to grow up, it's the fact that we didn't have much of a child/teenage hood, like when I was in middle school COVID hit, and I wasn't able to be a teen, like I'm 18 but I still feel like i wasted so much time to have that early independence, and almost getting to 19, it makes me feel like I lost the majority of my life, and I haven't been able to have the evolution I should've gotten, not only that but seeing how the world is, it's not made for us, like how there's more ghost jobs, less 3rd places to hang out with Freinds, and we just can't own anything. Everything is subscriptions and by-now-pay-later, so a lot of us just don't have any drive to do anything, we can't have anything, so why even bother with trying. It's a forced lack of motivation due to the current climate. That's what my experience is anyway.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Girl, 50% of gen z is older than 21, the oldest Gen Z is 27. What are you talking about?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yea I think the flip side of this was missed in the video. Yes, kids who are coddled might struggle to be independent in the real world, but kids who weren't given guidance and emotional support can feel completely rudder-less and anxious about doing anything because they don't have a foundation of safety if they fail.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m right there with you, child of a violent addict here. When you grow up in an environment like that, you get used to survival mode and being forced to be resilient. When you hit adulthood, you’re just exhausted of fighting to live a normal, peaceful life, only to be thrown back into the fray that is existing in the modern world right now. I wish I had the right things to say, but I’m still figuring this out myself. Wishing you the best.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same lol I moved out at 18 and my mom did not coddle me she treated me like a grown man since I was 16
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You could try community college. And depending on what your fasfa says, you could pay nothing aside from the time to go there. It's really important to get certs or technical degrees if you want to make a living though
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: same. it feels like i’ve been clawing for normalcy or just to get the simplest things that everyone around me already started with. it’s very disheartening to see that this is how we are viewed. I am very fortunate to have gotten my own low income apartment while i try to build a future but it still feels like there’s a hole in the bottom of my bucket every second
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Have you looked into maybe doing tech or trade work? In my city they’re hiring city bus and transit workers for as much as my white-collar salary, and like 10k above my husband’s.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i hope you hang in there <3. i've decided to try to put myself out there more, like joining some free social groups, so maybe that could help you too? having a solid safety net is important (but difficult to acquire if you had a traumatic childhood or have any disabilities). wish you the best, and apologies if the free advice that i'm not even following yet is annoying lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@signs-sirens  thank you I have a small group of friends but they moved out of state a Lil while ago still trying to make new ones in my area tbh it's kinda harder now as an adult to make them since everyone kinda also has their own things going on
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Literally this. I've recently tried to spend less time on my phone and the result? I'm spending so much more. Luckily I have a healthy enough income to support the increased spending but if I was any worse off I would definitely go back to spending all my time on my phone just to save money
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @emilyp81 I'm on my phone and listen to videos on my headphones and take the bus and walk through town/the city but don't buy that much when walking around. Lots of places force you to buy something if you need the bathroom though so you have to know where all the reasonable places to pee are.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'll take it a step further and say that it's messed up how we've built this car-dependent culture such that having a driver's license is a "need" to "grow up"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ArchIVEDCinema agreed  I have vision issues so driving is not an option for me so i literally CANNOT do anything because nothing is in walking distance thats fun and even if it is you risk get hit by some idiot driver with every turn you take
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @ArchIVEDCinema Bruh when I was in Japan I loved how I didn't need a car. I was able to travel wherever I wanted. Now back in the states I have to go get my permit and just paid 1k for driving lessons. I cant even take the lessons until I pass the written test to get the permit. So now I'm just studying. All this extra time and money being spent just so I can have more mobility.  And without a drivers license there are many jobs you can't get. While a Gen Z Japanese person is able to save not needing a car and has more job opportunities due to not needing to have a drivers license to work. You see the difference?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ArchIVEDCinema  it's not a "culture", it's literally just based on the fact that very few places/cities in the US are walkable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People will give all of these reasons  for why people are failing to launch. Despite the reasoning being sound, THIS, is what the problem is. You hit the nail on the head. No one can actually LIVE because  of the state of the world. Working people are getting priced out, and the omega wealthy just keep on getting wealthier. I went on a tangent but again. You hit the nail on the head
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @michaelowens5813  I mean I’m living just fine but go off on how no one can and I’m gen z
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 4 years ago renting a home was in the 600 dollar range but a trailer was 400 to 450... 4 years later the food now costs so much money that you'll spend what used to be trailer rent and get back with half a month worth of food or less... Absolute insanity for a basic necessity that should be free and the rent is also now tripled...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm working towards becoming an Adult. I can't pay for a car or insurance because I medically can't. I try to get a full-time job but companies won't hire Gen Z Applicants. I can't afford rent but I have 3 part-time jobs. I could leave college after 4 years but it is more financially stable and advantageous to stay in school longer because then I will still get meals I can keep going while the economy is down turning yes I'll have more debt later but at least I'll survive the crash
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hi! I just wanted to give a few ideas of some free or low cost things I used to do in my early 20s while in grad school that hopefully will help :) Obviously, this is based on my experience of access to things in my city but these are things I used to do to save money because cocktails and ubers were expensive. Going on jogs or walks with people on a trail or in a park. Instead of happy hours me and my friends would have "healthy hours" and go to the gym together in our apartment gyms that came free with rent. Instead of getting drinks, we'd get a latte or hot chocolate for a few dollars and window shop. Finding festivals in town to walk around in. Free concerts in the park. Having girls night in instead of going out. I live near natural rivers so we would go to the river on the weekends and bring some sandwiches and some beers.   I had to cut out a lot in grad school but these were good ways to get out of the house and get in social interaction with friends on a small budget! Hopefully one of these may work for you!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's so true that car insurance feels like a racker these days. If I could get a fuel efficient simple car for $8K, and then insurance every year was a lump sum of like $200, THAT would be reasonable. But nah. Car insurance companies trieat it like a whole nother cash cow opportunity. I might as well get an e bike or an E-scooter. Then bundle up in the winter.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Iquey  FWIW if your commute is less than like 6 miles you can get most places within half an hour on a class 1 ebike (<20mph). I ride year round with some rain gear for when it's warm and a leather jacket and handlebar covers for when it's cold (good to like -10°F with thin gloves on, thanks Indiana). Not the cheapest way to get around but it's way cheaper than a car, helps your brain since you get some exercise getting around, and you won't be sweaty going everywhere. Busses are nice though, as long as service is actually decent.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this might be part of the problem but it absolutely extends beyond that. even in europe where cars aren't as necessary and housing is more affordable, the same issues still persist
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @HoneyDoll894  well a lot of European countries are still dealing with large corporations buying all the single family housing such as in the U.K. But the problem is significantly lessened in countries like Germany, France, Sweden and Norway since they have rent controlled housing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @HoneyDoll894 housing isn’t affordable anywhere in any 1st world country. Don’t think it’s isolated to your town/city/country.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yea, i felt no inclination to drive when I was in high school because the only place i would drive to is school and back. Why put myself through the stress of traffic when i can sit on the bus stress free instead? Never made sense to me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes 100%. I was listening to this video and was constantly disagreeing with the point of the video. It's not that our generation wants to be childish and lazy. It's the cost of living becoming so unaffordable to the point lot's of people have given up. It feels like this video was written by a 75 year old boomer that's been retired for 20 years now and is completely out of touch of our current economic living conditions.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: U know what the funny thing is? We have the same problem here in the netherlands. And probably also in most of europe... Ur not alone
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Dude, it’s majorly of the world, not just the US. Same/similar issues here in NZ! Quite right though.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Plus other countries have multi generational homes. That’s honestly what plays a part in Asian Americans for example building a lot of wealth. They graduate from school go back home get a job and save and invest. A lot of other cultures stay home until they’re married fr
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: YUUUUP. there's a reason this first became a thing in the early 80s.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I doubt it's that simple.  Nothing is. Even wealthy kids and young adults have spiraling mental health.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They expect us to put in the time we have on this earth for minimum wage.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a millennial and I have always felt this way. I can only imagine how much worse it is for someone entering adulthood now. It’s not just cost of living either, it’s knowing that the inequality is going to keep getting worse, and that the solutions people turn to will be far right authoritarian regimes (already the case), plus climate change, plus AI.   Personally I think we owe it to ourselves to recognise the rational basis for gen z checking out.  Also, all the best to you commenter. I wish I could offer more encouragement or reassurance. I guess I can offer “as someone from the generation ahead of yours, I see you, your concerns are valid.” 🤷🏼‍♂️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @hideshiseyes2804 you've been brainwashed.   Sad to see
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: GenZ don't only exist in US lmao, there are other issues too
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is a factor but I know plenty of people who just simply don’t want to, and I was at one point the same way. People nowadays are generally less ambitious for one reason or another. No social draws to go out, no internal push to move away from the comfort of home (eg; parents don’t care, won’t help… so on), and convenience. But I will agree economics have an influence in everything I just listed, but most young people aren’t thinking that far ahead. It’s a wall they haven’t even gotten to see yet.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not really lol. Teens don't typically think about those things unless their parents are really loud about it. Our parents complained about finances, but they still made it work even when we were in the red. Hell, it's a bigger problem from rich kids who come from rich families in my experience. Poor kids tend to recognize you need to work for access to important resources like driving and that you can't do a whole lot without a license. How can you work your 2 jobs you need just to survive if you have to rely on unreliable transportation methods? "My bus was late" will only get you off the hook so many times before your boss/teacher/partner/etc expect you to find other options/resolutions.  Absolutely a valid and major factor, but there are so many other factors, related and unrelated, at play here.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It doesn't because a lot of people can still mentally act like adults.... But they want to act like children.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not to mention the lack of public transportation, walkable cities, and 3rd places.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is exactly how I felt going from teens to twenties and it’s only gotten worse, it’s very very true. There were definitely permeating elements at play for me too, but this was a huge factor.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes and no. Everything is expensive but there are still tons of free opportunities to not be on your phone. But when you’re depressed and the only coping skill you have is brain rot the. You will absolutely gravitate to that instead of going to the library, park, to volunteer, walk around with friends or family, visit a state park/lake this summer, etc.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm from Germany and getting your driver's license itself has gotten RIDICULOUSLY expensive over here
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im from europe. its not just in the usa
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Depends on where you live at, my brother found a luxury apartment for 1.2k that’s it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So true! I had a coworker years ago that didn’t want to do anything because he’d have to spend money on gas
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Somewhat.  Not the whole story though
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 100%. I have this conversation with my partner and close friends all of the time but what made me truly realize shit was bad when I started talking to a friend of a friend at a party about it 😭 I thought she was super rich based on her social media and the fact she owns a business. It was very eye opening to know she feels the struggle as much as the rest of us because as soon as you get ahead slightly, you either have to keep living below your means to save a negligible amount or you improve your lifestyle and continue to not save. It sucks. I used to be so career driven and now I couldn’t care less. 🤷‍♀️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In regards to cars, it also depends if you live in rural vs urban areas. I grew up in a more urbanized suburbs, so I actively didn’t have to drive because I had both buses and trains I could take to get to work in school. I didn’t get my license till I was 23 and had to because I moved to a more rural area where it was required to get around
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Self driving cars are coming 😂no need
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: literally starter houses these days can be a million and starter adults are not even making 6 figures let alone enough money to actually afford that kind of house. my first job was in uni and it paid $8 an hour. i literally started crying when i went to the store to buy cough syrup and it was 17 fucking dollars. over 2 hours of working to buy cough syrup. "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" and rent plus utilities is 1.5k and you're making 10 dollars an hour like hello
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For a different hobby, you can take the Quantic Foundry test to see what video games are right for you, then get into emulating old games on a smartphone, or affordable gaming PC build that can last you a long time. I've been making up challenges, allowing me to play an old Armored Core game on my PS2, for years. And the same save file can be used in 2 sequels. I want a gaming PC or Steamdeck, but this millionial has other priorities. Like selling nearly everything I have, to relocate to a cheaper place.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I thought it was something like <20% of teenagers who actually thought their own cars - like sure plenty of people might contribute somewhat to the cost, but it is also so common in the US at least for teenagers to either get their car bought for them outright or inherit an old parents car
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, that's not it. It's the same way in most of the world, here in Czechia, I don't have a driving license because I don't want to and don't need to thanks to the public transport. I just bought a flat. I still feel the same way. I've been checking boxes, finished the (free) uni, worked for three years, bought a flat, started doing sports, trying to stay social... The pointlessness and emptiness prevails.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: She loves complaining about capitalism without actually saying the word capitalism. She honestly just seems like a closeted conservative.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This!! I'm pregnant and considering ending it because I just won't be able to afford it despite wanting my daughter. I am also disabled and can't just "work harder" and so I give up knowing that no matter what I do, it won't be enough. No motivation knowing the goal line is further away
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Everyone I knew had roommates until their late 20s until they hey got into their permanent relationships then they got houses in their 30s. These kids just think that we were all living in the 1950s until 2015. They have no perspective they are rich people online and think that’s how everyone lives except them. Get a shit job get a roommate or 2 move out of your parents house experience “real life” get a life partner move in together combine resources (the sum is greater than the parts) and begin your life. You aren’t gonna get a 100k job out of college stop extending your adolescence into your late 20s
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was thinking this. I'm an older Gen Z with multiple degrees, I'm working on my second master's now to get a licensure as a therapist. However I'm stuck in debt and the cost of housing where I live is through the roof. I can't move forward I'll just have to continue to save money while living with my parents. I am in a relationship and we've talked about getting married but we are both back in school because we left college and our first jobs paid us below $20. We work multiple jobs just to save and pay for our current debt and bills. So...I'm not sure what else I can do?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @kelly._.wagle11 no judgement just curious why do you have multiple degrees? Didn’t you get a degree with a career in mind that would have a return on investment greater than the cost of the degree?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you, it's not that we don't want to. We literally can't, no one can with what's happening to our economy that thanks to the current people in power, is  probably going to get worse.  It takes a lot of my strength just to get up and live life. Back in the past you could make minimum and still afford a house. These days you can have multiple and still need a room mate. And come 2026 it's predicted billions of people are going to potentially be dead, homeless and so on and those who will have homes will struggle to keep them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Teens like myself also don’t want to drive due to cars being unsafe and the fear of crashing. That’s the main reason I don’t drive to be honest
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @nijuuroku well to be honest I know it hard and praying  you get through the fear but honestly we are going sir some day we have to out face the fear mind you I speaking from experience I used to be afraid of nights then I start get roller coasters and letting  go now fear is gone it’s not easy but you can do it you got this I believe in you and his does too rooting for you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The younger you are, as in a new driver, the HIGHER insurance costs are because it’s been that way since the late 80’s. Why? Brand new young drivers are the most at risk for distraction based collisions on the road and speeding behind the wheel! That’s why it doesn’t drop till you’ve been driving at least for a minimum of 5yrs or after the age of 25, the year in America you can legally rent a car in all 50 states.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You can invite friends over and hangout in real life! Free.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: whos we? lmao get ur money up brokie 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You also kind of have to admit young people will come up with any excuse to not have to try
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Older Gen-X.  No one in my age group  was even thinking of buying a house at 25.  As teenagers we drove ugly embarrassingly bad used cars - we called them Hoopties back in the day. Not uncommon to have a rusted out hole in the floorboard you could see the street through!  I didn’t know anyone who bought a new car.  During and right after college we lived in rat trap apartments with zero amenities, worse than the average section 8 apartment now days.  No dishwasher or laundry-definitely no pool or gym. I had to light my ancient over with match and make toast in the living room because there were no plugs in the kitchen. It’s just the way it was and we didn’t expect more until we paid our dues and got to a better stage. And we were mostly middle class kids raised in solidly middle class homes. But starting out we knew we were going to have to start building from the bottom.   We didn’t expect “nice things” and struggle was just part of this phase of life.  It made us able to face challenges head on as we got older.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@tangyjoe4326 everyone likes to talk about older folks having a lack of understanding on how bad gen z has it but gen z has an insane level of entitlement because they were raised on a lack of struggle. All through school and life they've been told if they just check these boxes they'll he successful and have a better life. But never realized it's a long game. My parents are gen x, and raised middle class, but they didn't really get on their feet and get stable until their 40s and only now in their 50s are doing good.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @dougm7828 Sounds like you’re making excuses for a broken system.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think its more to do with you being brainwashed by neo liberal media and school to have a defeatist attitude towards everything. You've been taught  since birth that you have no agency, you can't deal with that bully yourselves zero tolerance tell a teacher and they'll handle it for you. So now in life you have no agency and no drive and are just waiting around for the government to tell you what to do. Your great grandfather's grew up in wood shacks, got a third grade education at best and only had a future of spending their lives hunched over in a mine, living in a company shack in debt and dying at 50 from black lung to look forward to and they STILL rose up and faced down actual machine gun fire to improve their lives. And yet here you sit doom scrolling on tik tok whining about how hard it is 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's a choice you made. My youngest son had over 60K saved by the time he was 25. His girlfriend had the same. Car payments? Pay cash for a used car. Buy 2nd hand. Stop eating fast food. Study and learn a new skill.  My son is 32 now and he has 150K saved and so does his girlfriend. They have zero debt. It's a choice.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @lajuanaraye I’m not saying it’s impossible, but I’m saying it’s extremely hard and unrealistic for most of us. Some people have families to care for, some people have to take out student loans to continue school, and some people live in places (like New York or LA) where the cost of living is just way too damn high. I’m happy that your son was able to meet those milestones, but not everyone is gonna reach that by just “not buying fast food” and “buying second hand”.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: bro, our grandparents and/or great grandparents lived through some of the harshest recessions and most brutal wars imaginable... they still made it work...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Ztzyyy  they also lived in the most prosperous economic time in history, due to various factors, none of which were “they were more productive workers”—we’re more productive today than any generation before.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "No teenagers want to drive because car payments are insurance are through the roof."  Are you sure thats the reason? I'm sure that accounts for some, but there's still gotta be teenagers who don't yet have to worry about car payments and yet are still scared of driving. I'm elder gen Z and got my license at 18 but didn't really embrace driving until I was 21 and from ages 15-21, driving absolutely terrified me, even tho I could use my parents old car. It was more about the possibility of killing someone and being risk averse, than the money
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jin394 it’s probably more about how many stupid people there are on the road My parents almost get into accidents daily that wouldn’t be their fault People dont follow road rules anymore or just dont know how to operate a car safely so i can see why no younger generations want to drive
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So your solution is to ignore the situation and enter a bubble so as to avoid reality.   I do recognize the economic struggle. However, what you are doing will not “get you to the other side”. Rather, you are deliberately allowing yourself to fall further behind.   This is not a “ you must enter the rat race” chide. This is a “ you are doing yourself a great disservice” warning.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Insurance prices aren't that different from when Millennials were getting their licenses and what kind of dumbass is buying a car that is expensive enough to require payments for a teenager?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Regarding housing, you are mostly correct regarding home purchasing and renting with the caveat that roommates can alleviate the rent. Regarding cars, you're incorrect about it being a payment issue; it's a supply issue and a rise of Uber and Waymo.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: To some degree. Every generation experienced phases of economic downturn. At a certain point you have to stop worrying about stuff you can't control, and focus on what you can. Your health, mental health, your finances... we are not entitled to anything, we have to work for it, and happiness is a side effect of meaning.  Find something meaningful to you that allows you to support your self, and satisfaction will almost always follow. To sit around and blame external factors is folly, and will keep you down. Not everything that happens to you is your fault, but the reality is it's your responsibility to find a way to deal with it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @warrenpeace2111  I understand that sometimes you have to deal with what cards you have, but this isn’t a “pull yourself up by the bootstraps” type of problem. Jobs don’t pay enough, you can ask anyone that. And prices are crazy. The federal minimum wage is still $7.25 in states where car payments and renting is well above $1000. Even people with meaningful degrees are working at fast food restaurants or working entry level jobs that pay less than $20/hr. It’s an economical problem for a lot of us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @warrenpeace2111  "we are not entitled to anything"  Uh yes we are? That's literally the whole point of society existing lol. People are given rights and entitlements to incentivize them to participate, they are gone now so have fun with society falling apart.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Regarding cars, that's what "clunckers"  are for. Go buy some old car that gets you from point A to B. Or ride the bus. Car insurance is expensive, but that's why you have the option for Liability only insurance, which is cheaper. You get 2 - 3 jobs to pay for what you need, until you find a job that pays well enough that you can quit the others. You find a house or apartment to rent with 2 - 3 other people. No matter how reliable those roommates may be, I recommend finding a month to month lease in case anything goes south. Very few walk out the door and into a life that is already set up, we have to work hard for what we want. I had 2 part time jobs from 16 to 24. Finally three years after I graduated college, I found my job now that allowed me to get a mortgage for a home. Even then I had a roommate for a couple of years. Also guuurl.....idk how you do it. The longer I'm on my phone, the MORE money I spend 😂 Ooh! There's a sale??! Lol. I go for a walk, read books, play video games, draw, or paint when I want something to do other than watch TV. Otherwise I'm spending money on stuff I don't need. We all got our issues 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: there's no such thing as clunkers anymore. 15-20 year old cars nowadays going for nearly $10k. my bf bought his 2000 model car for $1500 two years ago and i'm sure he's already spent like $5k to maintain it. it's just not worth it anymore
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @taylorcook1765  Problem with said "clunkers" is that depending on how old they are, they can break down more easily and you're just end up spending hundreds - low thousands in repairs, so that's something to keep in mind.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No it doesn’t. So many are living at home with no bills. Most are lazy, depressed, with no social skills. They’re entitled andto ungrateful and feel like they shouldn’t have to work hard for anything. They think life should be easy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @emex313 .  You’re part of the problem, standard bootstrapping argument please stop this…. It’s embarrassing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And no one is talking about the gen z homelessness epidemic. By 26 I’ve been homeless. I’ve survived a winter with no heat. I’ve missed more meals than I can count. I literally have not been able to maintain a healthy weight because food is so expensive. I have a useless education in research biology because my president deemed my career, my LIVELIHOOD, as unnecessary waste fraud and abus3.  What is the point? What is the point?!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And it's wild how the older generations think you can just "start a family~ don't worry about the financials,,,things will work out~~". Like, no, brother, gen Z doesn't want to have kids because they see no future for their kids, let alone themselves.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: omfg... exactly..thank you!😭 im so tired of people constantly blaming us for even the things we can't control especially (like yes...gen z has many problems and it sucks that many don't have the motivation to get rid of those issues)...like how is the economic collapse my fault??...and the amount of times me and other gen z people around me were met with so much judgement for having certain dreams/hobbies is.. ridiculous
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fellow Gen Z here. It’s interesting that so many of my peers see this video as an attack on personality/identity instead of the cultural and sociological assessment that it is. It’s safe to say that the economic reality for young folks is a driving force behind these problems, but we’d be remiss to ignore other contributors, especially when we have more control over them than we do the economy.   What do you do? Put yourself out there and get creative. Seasonal work often provides housing/food for insanely low prices if not free. There are seasonal jobs all over the country. It’s an incredible opportunity to earn and save money, since often times you’re not having to pay rent. NETWORK. I know it sounds corporate, but networking is just a fancy term for making connections-  both personal and professional. Show up to your town’s planning board meetings, volunteer at an animal shelter, go to community events and talk to people.   It’s hard to put yourself out there, it feels vulnerable and uncomfortable, but it’s so important. When you make strong connections with people, there’s a chance they will think of you when opportunities arise.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You make a good point me and brother have really no interest in going to college and just gonna stick to GED for me and a high school diploma for my brother we both still live with our parents I'm 17 and my brother is a year or 2 younger than me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1000%, this is a millennial guessing based off the internet
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah I couldn’t agree with most of the points in this video tbh.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Like she’s right in a sense, but this video is such a massive generalization it almost renders the arguments invalid.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yep this take felt like a cranky out-of-touch elder giving a lecture
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @genghisvon  Did you even watch the video! wtf
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah I mean just look at how many times she's talking about literal children. I'm gen z and I'm 26 teaching at a university for my master's degree. Most of us couldn't have even been iPad kids because that technology did not exist.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @allybuggyboo  Exactly! I would’ve been around 8 or 9 when the ipad first released. At that point most kids were interested in their parent’s or school’s computer playing web games on sites like Disney Channel. Kids born in the late 2000’s, like my younger siblings, were probably one of the earliest Ipad kids with apps like Angry Birds and Talking Tom.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@allybuggyboo im a few years younger gen z and your so right. While the iPad came out when I was a kid, I didn't know any damn "iPad kids". (Nobody could afford it either)  I had a family computer that I barely got to go on
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @allybuggyboo  Wrong ...bMost people under like 22-24 are the original group that grew up glued to devices like iPads and tablets. Even some in that area of 22-24 years old did too. The problem is that the lots of you take this as an insult. But it's not. It's just a difference in how they were raised.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video clearly tells me that she grew up with the kind of privilege that she can't remotely imagine that someone didn't learn to drive out of poverty, and never had a choice to be paralyzed over.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Totally agree with this. Honestly, it felt like she was talking about gen Alpha more than she was GenZ... Completely out of touch with the GenZ culture
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Us older Gen Z basically get ignored tbh. Too old to be Gen Z, too young to be Millennial
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How can we talk to any of you when you never even leave your bedrooms because of anxiety?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @fuosdi64  You’re talking to us right now what do you mean?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nah bro you gotta work at the bagel shop for 2$ an hour and vote for the billionaires to get tax cuts.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I 100% feel this story and it’s something I’m experiencing rn. Having to stomach my minimum wage job after I was laid off from a job in my field of study. I’m looking at getting a manufacturing certification and finding a job that actually pays a living wage
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What about basic clerical work in an office of answering phone, paper filing, computer entry data, and printing documents for others as a job option?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Random and no t asked for but recently came across ppl talking about ms and how it’s linked to parasites - not saying it can fix anything but it’s such a simple thing to try and if it helps the ms some great - if not at least there would be no parasites
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @ElinWinblad autoimmune stuff can be genetic but flares are triggered by stress. Not only physical parasites but..social parasites can cause stress that makes MS harder. Chronically ill  people have to be so careful of what kind of people are allowed around them because a cruel or selfish person around you can make it a lot worse.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ElinWinblad  Your comment is extremely ignorant and dangerous. Those people are quacks who aiming to sell you products by preying on your fear and lack of education. If you genuinely think you have parasites- see a real dr as they can test for it and treat it. MS is caused by genetics, not parasite, you grifter.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah I think this video is a miss from her
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video is screaming with extreme privilege. We're failing because choice paralysis? Potential? Poor kids grow up knowing they have no choices and no potential. To think someone is looking between being a lawyer or a doctor while holding a 10 dollar bill ends up deciding that they can't choose so they'd rather rot? Actually disgusting.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @persomnus I’d say people who have the ability to live at home with their parents are the ones with extreme privilege.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You must have missed the end of the video, where she says that not all of gen z falls into this category.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Okay, and how often are you buying door dash or going out to eat?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @nathanmjackson1210  don’t even have the door dash app on my phone and going out to eat for us is literally going to get a hot dog from Costco, but yeah go off and keep telling me this is my fault 🤣🤣
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @nathanmjackson1210  I do neither because there is no reason to.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​ @nathanmjackson1210  door dash doesn't exist where I'm from lol...and I'm often the one who makes an effort to pay for family trips...come up with plans to visit different places for everyone around me to experience...it's amazing how people like you..don't see the other side of the story and generalize a whole generation of people....not surprised coming from the so called adult
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's surreal, because a lot these Gen Z kids are going through what sounds like the exact same Quarter Life Crisis I went through as a Millennial. But the circumstances are even worse now to the point where I have to admit that I was lucky to have come into adulthood after the Housing Bubble and not during the post Covid years.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Being poor today isn't the same thing as being poor 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @matane2465 it’s not even the same as 10 years ago
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same! I graduated HS in 2005, my parents gifted me a car that was like $2,500 (1998 Mazda 626!) at 18 after I passed my drivers license road test.  Today, that car would be more like $15,000-$18,000! I think the fact that companies have quadruple inflated everything around the country to like insane prices that only the wealthy can drop at a hat and does affect their bank accounts, is why we’re all struggling. But Gen Z, they had zero head started except the ones born before 2000! Everyone else? They were set up for financial failure cause if the banks weren’t bailed out in 2008, we wouldn’t be in the position we are now!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The over-complication of getting licenses, certifications, getting jobs, etc has truly paralyzed people who would have jumped for the opportunity. I long for a time where a person who did not even complete high school is given a chance to work in a company and succeed if they try hard and do well in their work. Barrier of entry is just unnecessarily high without proof of higher quality of outcome (crazy drivers on the road, just the same!)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Furthermore, some driving instructors just don't care to see you succeed, at least where I tried to get my license. They find everything and anything, and don't let you pass without being perfect. It's exhausting and frustrating and makes it seem like there's no point in trying, because the instructors just do. not. care.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bruh what state? In Indiana you can just lie on the training sheet and if you pass the driving test after a year of getting your training driver's license you're G2G
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Sharkuterie327 And through it all…  She got her license.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well no, they didn’t even need a degree lol  We arguably have an overqualification problem. One of the greatest societal pranks ever pulled was convincing everyone that a degree was a good substitute for practical experience. For doctors, lawyers, etc. it was actually a massive help. The majority of jobs though literally do not require a degree; all they need is for someone to be willing to teach you how to do them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @fuwameanssoft  Disagree. Having a degree is okay, decent specialization. The problem is that employers want you to think it's your your fault why you're not getting hired. This killing of the economy has nothing to do with us except in that it hurts us. Stockholders simply want more work for less people, and less jobs for the same money. If it were ever any easier than that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I graduted uni fifteen or so year ago, and I had the same problems, minus the AI cv checker I guess. I ended up taking a completely different path than the one I chose, and I'm mostly pretty happy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How does getting a license cost $2k? 🤔
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @hannahhoopss  maybe including drivers education? Still, I agree, 2K seems a little high...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As someone who used to read a lot of resumes....Gen z REALLY sucks at writing resumes and interviewing. We could always tell how old someone was purely based off of how they wrote and structured it. It's ironic how much gen z hates boomers because their resumes and interview skills are almost identical, the only tell between them is boomers obviously have much more experience listed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Patson20 A Boomer has entered  the chat lol👴💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Patson20 Y’all say ANYTHING on the internet (this probably my 5th time this week saying this) 😂  How exactly is a 21 year old  that has worked one job bad at writing a resume? Again did they misspell their name? 🤣 sheesh
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The worst part are the economists who gaslight us by telling us this is the strongest economy ever. Their obsession with GDP and flawed methodologies in calculating true inflation and unemployment is absolutely horrendous.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @BOSSDONMAN  It's the strongest economy ever *for the rich*, not the rest of us
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @BOSSDONMAN So on point, unemployment is down, ignore that it's because of the gig economy and they don't pay a living wage
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've got 99 problems but a better economy would solve most of, if not all of them
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s government and corporate corruption/greed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am starting to feel like Boomer mindset is a disease in California specifically. Meanwhile American Boomers infamously dislike California.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: An economy shaped by those same old people to boot. If anything Boomers have only grown in political power now that in retirement they do have all day to get indoctrinated and vote for their own favors, often at the expense of supports for the youth.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's really not though, sure a better economy would mean better savings for me but I'm living fine now at 28. The problem is gen z loves hemorrhaging money on conveniences they think are rights and doesn't know how to cook or budget. I'm 28, and I see this constantly with my friends and coworkers who make at or slightly above what I make. And yet they have less and constantly complain about the economy. Na bro its that you've door dashed food 3 times this week, get a 8 dollar coffee and 3 dollar energy drink and eat out for every meal while making payments on a car you can't afford and on a top of the line iPhone you didn't need.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Patson20  you'd have to be making a lot of money to afford to eat out every meal ... idk what other people are facing but that's definitely not what I'm facing. I moved back in with my parents because I couldn't afford basic food and got sick, not because I was spending my money on conveniences.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 25 on the same page burnout is no joke
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same. Went through college working 2-3 jobs started from 16 years old, went straight to 9-5 corporate job after graduating. Worked there for 4 years, I was busting my ass off to make my job very secured (due to childhood trauma seeing my dad losing his job in 2008 and struggled financially for 10 years). 4th year I was beyond burnt out and was having work-related nightmares, so I tried to set boundaries, said no to overtime. Bosses wasn’t happy, tanked my performance and fired me because I wouldn’t budge to take on second person’s workload. I’m much much happier now at 28 years old and unemployed. It beats a dead end job that doesn’t give a crap about my mental health. I’m honestly looking to just go back to a coffee shop and i would be happily to engage with customers & be friendly and not chasing past-due money from asshole corporate clients
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @limestar27  Have you considered working for yourself?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My dad's first real job was at 27 and he had no problem building a career after that. I've been working in my field since 20 and have barely moved up from a starting salary at 26. Its all rigged
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey just wanted to say im 25 and I am in the exact same boat. I been working and saving money since I was 16, but im so burnt out and unhappy all of the time. Its so hard
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 35 i havent worked super hard, am not depressed but do feel stuck sometimes. I feel you have plenty of time and if possible take a delayed gap year, try zero hours bar work for extra cash. Maybe.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m in my thirties, didn’t get a decent paying job that I mostly liked or even meet the person I eventually married until I was 28. I have friends that it happened even later for. I think the lie of figuring life out in your twenties has been told to every generation. I still don’t have everything “figured out” and probably never will, but I’m much happier and things are easier in my thirties. There are definitely things that suck more now than they did for those older than us (coughhousescough), but it seriously seems like every generation forgets what it’s like to be in your twenties once they’ve gotten older
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, and that's the thing. A lot of us did try and either failed or saw the opportunities being taken away. Had to drop out of pursuing graphic design because of the stuff happening with AI.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The stress of burnout/fears of the future at 25/26 caused a bipolar mixed episode and a major major eating disorder relapse for me. I’m 35, and thankfully things are much much better now, although financially I’m perhaps even worse off in repairing and rebuilding from having three major treatment stints and several short ones (3 weeks or less). But some things have definitely gotten better.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @MusikGirl23 what were the best things you learned
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yea, i honestly think the people with no drive or direction arnt missing anything anyways. Tbh they’re probably smart for not starting on the burnout path to begin with
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @lennyjade exactly. People say “your 20’s is for working your ass off” thats what this society wants you to believe. Exhaust and burn yourself out early. Don’t live life while you have the energy. Drain yourself till you’re 40 then when you have truly no energy then enjoy your money. Seems backwards.  I know a lot of boomers who lived like that. They tell people my age to do the same. Honestly I think they are just bitter that us young people are out enjoying our young lives while they didn’t. To be honest, can’t say I blame them either because Id be bitter too
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 28 going on 29. Been working at a factory with long swing shift hours for the last 10 years. I’m burned tf out too 💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hear you! I thought I was doing really good when I was 24. I had a decent job, money in the bank, was house hunting and tried to buy a few, but people wouldn't actually sell or I got outbid. But my factory had a mass layoff, then sold off part of the operations, I moved out of state, got messed over by another job, then another company I worked for did something they had to pay out a lawsuit for, I ended up homeless, moved a bunch more times, found only jobs that didn't have many hours, and finally ended up in an apartment. Don't give up. Life is a journey.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Do you hear yourself? "Rigged from the start" and then you talk about having a full time job, contributing to retirement, having a good credit, NO DEBT. Advise, stop working overtime, sleep early and do something new every weekend or two weeks.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Food is important too, and additives cause hormonal imbalances, that may cause depression and other physiological problems, take care of yourself! Hope it gets better for all of us
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jukebae8974 I eat great. I eat a whole food diet. I might have the occasional junk food or alcoholic drink once every 3 weeks or so.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’d say you’re actually in a fairly privileged position at 24. At 24 I was applying for food assistance to lessen the cost of living
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If it makes you feel better, I was in the same place at 25! I'm now 29, married, stable, and I LOVE my job. I'm still lightly burnt out but it is miles and miles better than it was even a year ago. Part of it is realizing and coming to terms with the fact that the expectations our parents set for us and displayed to us are unattainable. Still makes me sad but just because my path is different doesn't mean it's bad.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You are only 24, you have another 20 years before you can say you are burnt out. I didn't even see traction until I turned 30 and saw my income increase 80% over 9 months. You comment feeds into the whole GenZ laziness. It's all comparison to millenniums and to millenniums it was comparison to boomers. You will get there in time but your 20s are for working your ass off, 30s you see the benefits. 40s, I hope is just cruise control.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @AnnaliseVolken working 50 to 60 hours a week for 6 to 7 years feeds into the laziness view of Gen Z? I don’t think so. I think after years of grinding with taking little time off is the problem. Working that many hours used to get you somewhere. Now a days house prices and cost of living far outpace Gen Z’s ability to save enough for a proper down payment.  I have like 40K saved. Which used to be able to buy a starter home where I live. Now that same house is 500K and a down payment for that is 100K. So please, tell me how to not feel demoralized and burnt out.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That’s how it’s supposed to be. Why? Compound interest. The earlier you put in hard work now, the less you do later. I’d say keep it up another 2 years then start to work less. That’s what I did. Got 25k in an emergency fund, 100k in retirement, and a paid off townhouse before I am 30 in October. I can work less now and finally be free
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: lol, you’re expecting too much too early. Oooh, no I’ve worked so hard and I’m 24 and haven’t gotten anywhere.. You really don’t understand how time and life works yet. It takes your whole life to reach a point of comfort. You’ll have good years and bad years, points of change, failures, and success. You really won’t feel like it comes together until you’re close to 40, and that’s if you’ve really put in the effort and made sure you’ve worked towards your goals.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hard to work toward goals that don't exist.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am 30, first gen American, my parents had to go through a Soviet collapse and we had to start over twice in my life (first moving to Israel, then America). The F are you burnt out over at 24? Yeah, life ain't easy, what else is new?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @michaelkovalsky4907  You’re so special, aren’t you? 🙄
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes it hard but you’re have to grow I’ll be praying for you get a  job to stray then start a business
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Work around the system. My partner isn't rich, but he makes good money as a truck driver. Our rent is less than $800 per month for 2 bedrooms since we left the city. We don't count pennies or look for sales when we buy food. We just eat clean. I grow a few things on the patio to take our food bill down in the warm months, though. We have the cheapest internet and keep our energy consumption below average. We don't shop for things we can't use. I mend our sheets and clothing. We're saving up for 10 acres. All this with a 12 year old constantly eating the whole kitchen and outgrowing clothes. We're thriving after being homeless and in debt in 2020. Yes, I say we're thriving in our situation. We stopped trying to live everyone else's lives and found our own. Our ancestors did well without modernization. We can, too.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: exactly! i'm early genz almost in my 30s and i've done internships (even voluntary ones for my cv/experience), i worked my ass off in a company only to get laid off, got depressed, got another job, everything seemed to be going ok apart from the crunch and burnout eventually, then i got laid off again. i get so depressed feeling like being in the same career for over 3 years feels impossible (let alone the same company). i always thought when i landed a job i'd get to relax (financially) and be able to grow in my field, eventually reach a senior role and be somewhat ok/stable so these frustrated expectations are really distressing :/ even my ex work colleagues who are older and more experienced are going through this... linkedin and job finding is like torture. application requirements are completely out of touch with reality, the market is oversaturated, the application process is sometimes even humiliating with their questions. and being replaced with ai also doesn't help. i've had to work casual retail jobs between layoffs and it's so disheartening... sigh
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ghostlywarlock  I'm really feeling this right now, I'm staring down the barrel of 30, done mostly part-time/temp work since I graduated 5 years ago. I've struggled a lot with anxiety and depression. Now that I finally feel a bit better, a bit more able to cope and I want to progress in life, I feel like I can't because no one is willing to give me a chance. Looking at entry level IT roles, I've been learning, doing courses and certifications, hundreds of applications, a good chuck of then are like "applicant must have at least 1 to 3 years of experience" and proceed to give laundry lists of platforms/technologies you're expected to be familiar with, all for what is most of the time, pretty close to minimum wage. It really makes me think, are people with this kind of experience and knowledge really applying for and working these near minimum wage service desk jobs? Is that how bad it's gotten? Or are recruiters just out of touch? If it's the latter, it really seems to transcend organisations and even national borders.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @ghostlywarlock Let me guess, CS?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeah I came to say this, less young people are in permanent jobs, but it feels like there are less permanent jobs overall. I'm 26, most of my friends started "adulting" when they have locked down a job and a stable income, but not all have managed this, despite trying (and most of my circle have valuable degrees like engineering or programming)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Your last line is 100% true. I am about to be 30 and work full-time at a grocery store. I love my job but I definitely feel like management treat you like a teenager with no brain and no authority, no matter how old you are. It makes you feel like you have no agency.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah it was like that for me too. Graduated in 2022 and applied like a mad man. I think in total the amount of job applications I sent in were about 1000+. Took me about 18 months to get a full time job, and thankfully it’s remote too
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: literally!! the only reason i have a stable job rn is unfortunately half because of nepotism
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ooo good point. I’ll try and touch on that in a future video
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @AshleyEmbers  I would love to hear your analysis. I've been subscribed for a good bit, and I always enjoy your work! I think you covered the psycho-emotional side of things here very well
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Then take one of those part-time/temp jobs till something better comes along. Even if you only stay for 3/6/9 months, you have something on your resume so when they look for what work history you and experience, it shows you are versatile person who not only adapts, but has skills that can carry between both industries.   My career field is going through hell cause it’s attached to Hollywood film crews (the most unpredictable job work out there!), and it taught me have to ALWAYS pivot because my field is never promised for consistent work.   So go for the part-time/temp job, companies will hire you more knowing you took a job instead of having a very wide gap of no work between jobs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its a neverending cycle :/ Half of Gen Z relates to Millenials yet not a lot of people see this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @rosennacht7624  a average regular person like me or you won't be able to show this to the world 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No, I'm on the cusp of Gen Z/Millenial and when I was in middle/high school the older generations complained that millenials were selfish and asked for too much without the skill/experience to back it up. Millenials were the gen where being a girlboss was unanimously seen as aspirational, and the older gens thought it was delusional given how the gen was statisically lazier. Whereas Gen Z is seen right now as undersocialized and predisposed to give up early, where things like girlfailures and bedrotting are the more relatable modes of thought. Basically Millenials were seen as lazy dreamers and Gen Z are seen as anxious doomers.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They're doing it harder for longer lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: same and I also don't have an answer. It feels like everyone is waiting for something, some event that is about to happen. But nothing will occur. Nothing ever happens. And as we wait, our main focus is on the imagined rather than on the real. Thus, letting life fly by. It feels like we're just spectators, narrators, but certainly not characters in this play that is called humanity.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@superfluousnscrupulous capitalism doesnt force people to buy labubus on credit
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s not just kids. My husband is 49 and had 25 years of experience. His industry shut down during covid and now he can’t find anything except hourly, low paid work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I always ask myself if people claiming things about gen Z like this actually talk to anyone my age before speaking. It always feels so out of touch with what we are ACTUALLY facing. I wasn’t coddled AT ALL as a kid. In fact, I was forced into situations I was uncomfortable with CONSTANTLY. And guess what? It didn’t make my debilitating anxiety go away, it just poked at a festering wound and made it worse.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's definitely financial, I'm 24 and I work full time 40+ hours a week and a good 7 dollars above minimum wage. I still can't afford to live by myself in my area, much less save and get a house. It's just impossible now
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was born in 2000 (I’m 25) so I’m right at the edge — not fully Gen Z, not quite Millennial. Some people call it “Zillennial,” and that label feels pretty accurate. I’ve always been someone who thinks deeply about the world around me, especially the expectations we’ve inherited about how life is supposed to go.  We were taught to follow a traditional path: go to college, graduate by 22, get married by 25, have kids by 30. That blueprint might have made sense a few decades ago, but for many of us today, it just doesn’t align with reality. People are living longer, wages haven’t kept up with the cost of living, and life isn’t as linear as it once seemed. I absolutely believe in hard work, but I also believe there’s more to life than just working to survive.  At the same time, I really try to understand where older generations are coming from. Boomers, for example, were raised in a post–World War II era where the country needed rebuilding — and in that context, grinding nonstop and putting your head down made sense. It was about survival and unity.  But now, 70+ years later, the world has changed — and so have our values. Millennials and Gen Z care more about emotional well-being, personal growth, and questioning systems that no longer serve everyone. It’s not that we’re lazy or entitled (some are). It’s that we’re trying to build lives with meaning — not just follow a script
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 0:45 why is she completely ignoring the fact that Gen Z has the worst socioeconomic situation for a young adult population arguably since the great depression (i.e., the silent generation)?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We virtue signal and posture memes like “touch grass”, or “seek therapy”, but we all know its total BS. Our society is killing us, and we are STILL yapping about the damn phones, and bringing back parental abuse
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We can talk circles around this all day. The conversation will never progress until EVERYONE acknowledges that the root cause of this shit show is the economy. Now, I will openly admit that my family is well off, and I have ALMOST zero external pressure to build a career. That being said, I am MISERABLE living with my parents at 20, almost 21. I WANT to leave. I WANT to live on my own. Who wouldn’t, right?  I got hired at a dealership as a lube tech a few months after graduating trade school. Most of the guys in the shop are between 20 and 25. All of us except ONE guy live with our parents at 19/hr flat rate. That one guy is about to have a baby and just to make sure he can support his family set a company record for hours in a pay period and showed up EVERY DAY, for WEEKS. And his check was only just over 2k. If he worked like that all year he’d be grossing under 50k. How am I supposed to have confidence when working that hard that often for an entire year pays less than the national median for an individual by OVER 10K???  We are ALL criminally underpaid and the overcharging from corporations should constitute robbery and extortion. It’s fucking ridiculous.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I genuinely believe this video comes from a kind and caring place however,its disingenuous to talk about Gen Z in this light without recognising that there are so many things pitted against them in the everyday world. I'm inclined to say they are one of the most resilient generations considering all that's against them.   I love your videos but this is one that has rubbed me the wrong way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Our planet is dying. The economy is dying. we cant afford homes. Cant afford kids. Cant even afford rent. Everyone hates us.  And if we are in the US of A, you know darn well that our government is changing for the worse.  What is the point anymore? Whats the point?  Someone please tell me what the actual heck we are supposed to do.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Personally, I think that at least some of the discrepancy in mental health statistics comes from under reporting in older generations. I remember going to my mom as a child and telling her I felt sad and stressed all the time, and she told me that's just what life is like. She has as bad anxiety and depression as I have, but she just doesn't think so.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Parents are doing more for their children than ever." This is probably true; at the same time, older generations have done more to discourage entry into adulthood than ever.   They've removed social safety nets, embraced neoliberalism, defunded education, de-unionized the workplace, made cities more expensive and less walkable than ever, and so much more. So it's a little like saying "philanthropy is at an all time high" when broader sociopolitical and economic structures have been demolished.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m an elder Gen Z, I did everything right. Got good grades, followed the rules, had an internship, got a bachelor’s degree. Then all of a sudden post panorama, everything came crashing down. I’m in crippling debt, I can barely find a real job listing, much less for a job; if I didn’t have my fiance I’d probably be jobless living with my parents.  The reality of the situation is that we were raised to buy into a certain system and were sold guarantees of success by our elders that ultimately did not pay off. We’re on a burning planet with no retirement prospects, no excess money for savings let alone investment, no job protections, no affordable housing. We’ve all realized we’re playing a losing game here. It’s like every single mistake from previous generations has fallen squarely onto our shoulders when we’ve just entered adulthood. Of course we’re worn out and of course we have nothing to show for it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: okay but people bashing on younger people still living at home has more to do with the facts things are 10 times more expensive compared to other generations moving out
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm Gen z, I live on my own in an apartment, own my car, have insurance both health and car, pay my own utilities, regularly go to the doctor, and I can barely afford groceries after all of it, much less go out, meet people or even get a damn haircut.   It has nothing to do with choice, I have no options, no other job matches what I make without sacrificing my benefits, my pay, my living space, or my ability to help my family. I've done what I was told to do and I'm trapped. Of course everyone is completely aimless when every direction is a dead end.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 21 and I just moved into my first apartment a few months ago. My parents haven’t been in my life, but I do have family member support. I am mostly independent, but I still struggle with beginning life skills. I still don’t know how to drive, I just started figuring out health insurance and I have this overwhelming feeling that I should be so much farther along than I am. When I express this feeling to millennials and Gen x, they just pat me on the back and tell me that I’m figuring things out and it’s okay to take my time. There’s a growing census that nobody has expectations for Gen Z. I was even raised from a Gen X mother figure.I grew up learning how to take care of a home and young children. I just don’t know why I’m having such a hard time moving along now that I’m on my own. Why don’t I want to get out of bed? Why don’t I want to feed myself, learn how to drive so I can go places, meet new people and express myself confidently. I feel so stuck and it’s horribly frustrating.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 14:06 Speaking of that, I hate taking my son to the park these days. Like, the helicopter parents are jerks to other kids, especially the kids who parents aren’t within a few feet of them. Your kid could literally be playing like a normal child, yet threatened by an adult and in some cases assaulted because they think your ten-year-old is too big to be going down the slide where their three-year-old is literally in the way. I saw one kid run home and tell his mom he was being bullied, so she came back up there with her teenage son to threaten to fight the kid and tried to get him to tell them where they stayed to fight his parents. What actually happened was the other kids let him play football with them and the ball hit him in the face because he didn’t know how to catch it. He literally lied and his crazy mother and brother almost caught a case til I intervened and told them what actually happened. People are weird these days smh.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You want to know why older generations are out of touch? It's because they had it substantially easier.  Throughout most of the 80s, you could afford MEDIAN rent on a minimum wage jobs. This hasn't been possible for over 30 years now.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The kid with the football, sounds like a scene rip that happened when I was little with my cousin who always wanted to rough house, but then go cry to my aunt/his mom when he got hurt. One time the oldest cousin (Gen X) who was 15 was like, “Are you kidding me? He wanted to play with us, we told him we are rough housing and wrestling, we told him it’s okay if he doesn’t want to join in and do something else”, when his mom found out she turned to him & said, “Chris! Your cousin just explained what happened. It’s okay to sit it out so you don’t get hurt. You can go play with your younger cousins instead or you can come sit with the adults or go inside and sit next to your grandfather & watch baseball on the tv.”  Well, he ended up growing tougher skin and became resonance because he said no he wanted you to keep playing with us. From that day on he stopped running to his mom and took it on the chin the pain because he realized it was TEMPORARY!   I think anytime a kid over the age of 7 who runs to mom or dad instead of turning to the other kid their own age group and handling themselves first, is setting up their child to have their parents always bail them out if everything, expect their parents to fight their battlers, heck even god forbid let their child get a falling grade on a homework assignment! I can’t stand that Gen Z & Gen Aloha had a lot of parents who went to attack teachers who gave their kids failing grades and those kids deserved them because they didn’t know the material. Millennials and older? If you failed, YOU FAILED! You learned to deal with it, then you either asked for a makeup test, a redo, extra credit homework, or help after school with the material with either a peer from class, a tutor, or the teacher if they had the time or actually cared about their kids passing! Nowadays, this is why I feel for the teachers, they can’t do what they need to do to help kids learn and be resilient for the adult world the way they need to be in academics.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sadly you can’t just “move on” from trauma some of us have so much trauma it takes years of digging and you actually have to do very specific things to undo some of the “programming” it caused otherwise you just keep looping patterns. I’ve been in therapy for 10 years and each level I’ve felt huge amounts better and changed completely as a person and I’ve managed to move on from a lot of the trauma because of therapy not from avoiding talking about it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z is a massively split generation. Anyone who graduated High School before covid is pretty normal, while anyone post covid is pretty much exactly what you're describing. The older Zs don't buy anything or are tuned out because we just don't have the money, it's not like nobody wants to. Covid ruined half a generation and the entirety of Gen A, it's tragic.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an older Swedish Gen Z (in the Zillenial territory) I did everything "right". Got my degrees on time. Had internships and worked summers. Yet applied to over 200 jobs in a month to get... one reply. REPLY. Not interview. REPLY. Moved across the continent just to worked in a subpar hotel. Went back to uni (free in Sweden). Still can't get even a housekeeping or burger flipping job, nor any type of office (secretary, 'desk officer', etc.). So what and how exactly can I "grow up" if society as a whole rejects me and my friends? One of whom is a whole DOCTOR and had to move halfway across the country to find a job. A MEDICAL DOCTOR. 😭 and at the same time certain industries are saying there is no qualified workers "applying" or like in the EU, not enough youmg people. When THEY can't even reply to reject you 💀 the whole thing is broken and multiple friends are thinking of starting business "just to have a job" cause by now it seems to only way to have one is to quite literally create it yourself. It is all madness and I can't wait for 2030 when the last Boomers have retired.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I like your videos normally but this one did feel extremely out of touch even from the get-go, the premise/title of the video suggests that Gen Z is lazy, weak, and pathetic.

I am 28 and I have exactly 0 hope for anything.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m an early Gen Zer- 1998 baby. I can’t even begin to describe to you how much I hate being told that my generation was “babied too much.”   Without going into too much trauma from my childhood, I’m turning 27 next week and I’m finally gaining upward momentum in my independent goals. The “early blossoming into adulthood” I was supposed to have ripped my life apart by forces outside of my control.  After my dad passed away months before my 19th birthday, and the private art college (that I was privileged to attend) shut down due to bankruptcy, I was forced to navigate the “pick yourself up by your bootstraps” mentality that was shoved on Gen Z. As a closeted trans person, I had to stave off my transition until I was 23. Shoving myself down to survive, I had to navigate my first jobs, being fired for problems I eventually realized stemmed from a disability I didn’t know I had.  I was diagnosed with autism and ADHD when I turned 25 and it finally contextualized why I struggled with transitions in my life. I was shown time and time again that I was “marching to the beat of my own drum” and that I failed socially, without being given any solutions. When you’re autistic, you tend to take things literally. My parents’ word was law. If I wanted to drive and was told no, I never asked again. My “sense of adventure and teenage rebellion” was nonexistent. I never stepped outside the lines, and I never asked for anything besides the bare minimum. (I think most Gen Zers can agree with that notion.)  I’m finally picking up the pieces and trying again for my associate’s degree, even if it racks me with grief thinking of the opportunities I lost. I’m going in for top surgery after legally changing my name and gender marker at the end of this month, and I’m finally able to see a future outside of “making it to the end of the week.”  Turns out, I had to identify my own problems first before taking care of other people. Once I was supported as my neurodivergent self, and given the opportunity to return to school through a disability college program, was I finally able to make the shaky steps I needed for independence. I’m honestly starting to think about getting my driver’s license, which I’ve tried and failed three separate times. (Can’t practice driving if no one will let you use their car, go figure.)  I was raised by a boomer and a Gen Xer. Neglect and trauma can still happen to the most “coddled” generation. Most of Gen Z have turned out to be undiagnosed autistic/neurodivergent people, from my personal experience. And that comes with developmental delays.  Thanks for reading my novel of a comment, but I’m sick of people thinking my generation is full of underdeveloped, entitled teenagers. We’re trying. And for the most part, surviving.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: remember that GenZ are still pretty young (oldest turning 28y and youngest 13y this year) so these studies are not entirely accurate & i don’t think we can come up with conclusive data yet to be labelling this generation in terms of their career success especially considering the context of economic or social changes and challenges in this day and age & following the pandemic
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I want nothing more than to grow up, this last year has been extremely eye opening to the struggles i've dealt with in life because of my family, and I desperately want to get away from them, at least a little bit. But I don't want to have to work 80 hours a week just to afford my bills alone (with a bachelor's mind you) and I have no friends or girlfriend to split bills with  Edit: I also take slight issue with the premise of this video, while I can't speak to every facet that you spoke of, I don't agree with the mentality that certain things are "unavoidable suffering" instead of "unnecessary." Unavoidable suffering is unavoidable, and I can handle that stuff just fine, but to imply that much of the gen Z struggle comes from a lack of mental fortitude makes it feel like i'm being told i'm just not trying hard enough because I don't want to spend every waking moment of my 20's working when I have been told every age of my life that "the next one" is going to be the best time of my life. It wasn't middle school, it wasn't high school, honestly it probably would've been college if not for covid, and now im being told i'll "find my people" in my 20's while the gov royally screws my future bc they don't care about us, and I have to make up that difference myself because "i just need more grit and resilience"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 64 years old. I bought my first car in 1978. I was 17 years old. It was a 1968 Buick Skylark. I paid $800 for it. Insurance was $156 a year. I realize now, how lucky we were. You'll never see those days again.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 5:12 I relate to her boyfriend. But I have social anxiety and ADHD since I was a child. Doing those types of tasks are daunting, and I only get them done when it is a last choice.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Moving away from seeing driving as “adulting” is a good thing. Centering cars as an integral aspect of society has done great harm to cities and contributes significantly to a decrease in the types of 3rd places that are needed to increase social interaction and create a stronger sense of community.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Okay but where do teenagers go with cars? Theres no spots really to meet up anymore and everything is too expensive for them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Hurt is what traumatizes children", not exactly. Hurt or negative consequences, left unresolved and unhealed, is what traumatizes children.   Adversity is a natural unavoidable part of life. Children who undergo ACE's, or Adverse Childhood Experiences, are usually the most traumatized because their experiences were seriously abnormal with no positive guidance through them, which is what causes the trauma around certain things (relationships, socializing, decision-making, or more specific things like certain sports or types of social events). Hurt, is a subjective experience that requires subjective guidance through how it made a child (or adult) feel both internally and externally. Aside from a physical injury that causes literal hurt or pain, how a child is responded to and helped from that place of hurt is what impacts the child's psyche and if it traumatizes them or empowers them and develops their character and builds resilience and grit.   Risk-avoidant personalities stem from the fear of experiencing something that could be painful either internally or externally, but more so from the fear or lack of ability to know how to move forward if they fail; problem-solving essentially.  But hurt itself is not where trauma comes from. Trauma comes from unresolved problems or negative  experiences.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here to any Gen Z feeling the pressure, don't beat yourselves up, it's really not your fault! You're not alone, focus on meeting your basic needs to just get by, enjoy the little things there's nothing wrong with that!   The get good grades, go to college, get a job, make lots of money, live lavish, then you'll be happy pipeline was sold to my generation as well, God knows I tried in my twenties to achieve some of these things and failed miserably because the system was designed for me and others like me to fail and this isn't realistic.Did you catch that? The above model I just described that they shoved down our throats all through school is a lie!  You're not worthless, you're not lazy you know this because you kept showing up and giving your 1000% in exchange for peanuts because that's what the oppressors brainwashed you to do.  If you're feeling hopeless just remember what a blessing it is that you woke up today! Actually look around you and count a least three things to be greatful for, even if they seem small or mundane. Example: Thank God I have access to clean running water what a blessing, I know there's lots of people who don't have this luxury. If you're currently feeling burnout please do whatever you need to do to care for your mind, body and soul, no it's not selfish is necessary!     Most people don't have it all figured out in their twenties, your twenties should be more so about just getting real life experiences, I believe this is how one actually discovers who they are, what they like and dislike.   Lots of famous people that you may be looking up to struggled to achieve the "success" they have and will still have life struggles all the way up until they die. Why? because that's how life really works you just gotta learn how to take the good with the bad, no one's life is ever going to truly be picture perfect and that's ok. Real life is messy and challenging but you don't wait till you "have it all" to enjoy it.    Basically don't wait until you have all things to enjoy the gift of life, you were given the gift of life so you can enjoy all things even but especially the little things!  🙏   Side note:  maybe you achieve your personal dreams, the American dream in your forties that's ok too you don't have to have it all figured out now!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @AshleyEmbers You presented a legitimately interesting and necessary problem in American Society: Why do teenagers and young adults not achieve our long standing cultural milestone of adulthood.    I’m concerned about a few things: 1. You established early in the video that these are long standing measurements of adulthood, but the concept of leaving home at 18 to work and study and be fully autonomous was only practiced on a societal scale post-WWII and within the Baby Boomer generation.  For much longer before then (and still now in other countries) in North American and European cultures, children who grew into adulthood and stayed with the family in their home, possibly until they died or moved away much later. 2. You credit Gen Z as emotionally mature and competent, but still label the issue as apathy and lack of motivation on Gen Z’s part.  I’m having trouble believing that a generational trend has people being the most emotionally intelligent and self-actualized while also failing in major life milestones because they don’t care.  Either the problem IS within youths and they actually aren’t as emotionally intelligent as they are believed to be, or the problem exists outside of Gen Z’s true control. 3. You cannot produce media and assume that your audience knows your entire thought process.  I am on my hands and knees begging you to not cut the economic changes in America from this conversation down to a “final thoughts.”  You owe it to yourself and your audience to do the full job and present your entire argument because you cannot believe that all your audience members will do the work for you.  I want to hear what you have to say.  You are a smart and capable individual, and you have a good track record of being honest and fair.  This video cannot be a reflection of you as an adult woman.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Speaking for myself, I have been over protected by my parents my entire life. I wasn’t allowed to take the bus or even to walk alone to the store down the street. Now that I’m an adult, I happened to finish college just when the pandemic finished and there were no jobs and the prices for everything went up. Since I can’t afford to live on my own, I still live with my parents, who still are very protective. Everytime I try to be more independed my mom starts to really panic on fear that something will happen to me (and, honestly, so do I. I was raised to believe that if I put one feet outside my house on my own then I’ll be abducted). I know that I’m responsable to make things better in my own life, but it’s been a freaking loooong process. I feel like I’m trying to defend my natural needs and desires to grow up againts everything I was raised to do and believe, along with the economics issues worldwide
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just think it’s that the way the older generations “want” us to grow up is in a way so that they can take all our time and money for themselves.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I agree completely! The pandemic shifted things completely for those entering young adulthood.  I could buy a crappy used car for $600 and pay my rent on $12/hr. I think that finding my footing after high school (before the pandemic) made all of the difference in this context.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I still feel bad for my Gen Z cousin, as Covid struck her freshman year of college. As in she got one normal semester before the lockdowns
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 2001 and the first few years of college and independence was spent in lockdown. Everyone was stuck in our dorms or many chose to stay home and take classes online. So part of the stereotypical college experience was lost
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bro covid was a year, in some countries even less if lockdowns weren't tight. Covid was never the problem, its this impossible economy they've created
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was just talking with my partner about this. It’s the everyone born before 2000, who was on the brink of their mid-20’s or enter their mid 20’s who actually are the only Zennials & Gen Z’ers who have resumes with work history, actually got those early 20’s milestones, did t have helicopter parents, who actually got to have similar experiences as millennials. The 2000 and later Gen Z’ers? Ya’ll got f**ked over by the 2020 lock down because it officially robbed that bunch of social skills to adult experiences that can’t really be experienced anymore because society went so sideways during 2020 for anyone born 2000 and after!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @rhimaginemua  So basically only those born 1997-1999? 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Even if covid didn't happen, things would still be like this. The system was rigged from the start.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ever-delayed independence and milestone achievements by preceding Gen X and Millennials doesn't indicate hope that Gen Z will end up any better off though. Path dependence has only been getting more dominant upon life trajectories, with earlier missteps only getting harder to recover from.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Winner01562  ”generation z typically refers to individuals born between 1997 and 2012”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 😞same, i’ve never been to a dentist my whole life because i grew up poor where my mom couldn’t afford it; now i have to pay for insurance and find a dentist who’s covered or be thousands in debt, and deal with the mortification of going in and showing them something i couldn’t keep up or get checked. It’s scary to do and it doesn’t help living with no certainty and ability to cover basic things like dental health.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @PocketKanin I highly encourage you to get a check up sooner rather than later. A lot of dental issues can have a significant impact on the rest of your health, and costs for anything outside of a routine cleaning will quickly increase. Routine oral cancer screenings are extremely important. I can promise you that dentists and hygienists aren’t going to judge you for what your teeth look like.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Have you tried having an original thought before?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Patson20  you dont get out much
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Patson20 don’t you have weight to gain and exhaust to inhale
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The loss of third spaces is another issue, too. It's much worse than when I was a young teen in the 2000s.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Society has utterly destroyed spaces for teenagers. My friends and I would take walks in the park, sit in the trunks of our cars in the McDonald's parking lot, or hang out at someone's house (this was during covid). Anything else like going to a restaurant or doing an actual activity (bowling, roller skating, mini golf) was spending money that we didn't really have (even tho all of us worked during high school). At the local mall, you had to be accompanied by an adult past 5 pm unless you were in the movie theater. It was ridiculous. They would yell at you if you were more than 5 feet away from your designated adult. Gas was expensive, activities were expensive, and with being in high school, it's not like we had much free time anyway. Plus, helicopter parents are a nightmare. Sneaking out? Nope, your phone is tracked. Where do you go where you won't get yelled at by cops (especially bad if you're a minority)? Staying out late? You have school at 7 am the next day. The best thing teenagers and young adults have as a tertiary space is video game servers and social media. Are people still wondering why kids these days are always online?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @AshleyEmbers did you just delete my comment about Walmart selling sl4ve labored products that’s crazyyy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Walmart. I kid you not, me and my friends went to Walmart for fun in college (graduated this May)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They'll live there. At least in the US. Houses are too damn expensive. Everything is too damn expensive. They won't be able to afford anything but their cars.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SwprdSnapper285 *Case exclusive to the United States.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I completely disagree with the idea that gen z were "overcoddled." This seems like a very upperclass white idea. Im in the "zillenial" category i think, but i grew up in a trailer park with abusive and unstable parents. Every single friend my age has  had a similar background. I dont know a single person my age who had "supportive" parents. My life was a struggle and a fight to survive since the moment i was born. Ive been no contact with my family for years and have never been able to rely on them for help. I am not an outlier, this is extremely common in my generation. I dont know a single person who can rely on their parents.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Everyone I know thats over the age of 21 and doesnt know how to drive, has the reasoning that cars are too expensive to own (they right) gas is wild expensive, oil changes every 3 months, and random repairs 💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I always refer back to one of my favorite Plath poems when I get stuck in this feeling (29yo here)  "    I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet. "  Sylvia Plath, The Bell Jar   Just a reminder to everyone that people have struggled with this feeling for time in memoriam, and that you have your entire life to achieve the things you want to achieve if you are willing to make the sacrifices it will take to do so. c: of which, there will be an endless amount.  I've coped by accepting and becoming comfortable with "less", and rejecting the idea that we must "have it all". Practicing presence is the most important step for me (which is Sisyphusian for me as a maladaptive daydreamer, but what can you do)  Time is a construct, and so is culture. Cling to the things that make you feel real.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here and you can blame Gen Z? The Silent Gen and Boomers have gotten the "golden age" and we got nothing. Like, I had to live through 9/11, Middle East Wars, The 2008 crisis, Covid, two Trump presidencies, Social Media enhancing absolute idiots, and now AI. Gen Z has watched us suffer and lose so much that they aren't even trying and can you blame them?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The biggest problem is that all the benefits that were awarded to young people 50 years ago have slowly eroded over the past few decades. You can't buy a house off a single income anymore. You'll need at least two income streams just to get that deposit, at which point you'll be slowly paying off that loan for the next 20 to 30 years. And if you're renting, there goes half your weekly pay. The same goes for cars. I never bothered going for my license as I'd rather get around town on public transport (meaning I can use that time to read or play a game), which means I'm not having to worry about the financial cost of a car, insurance, registration, fuel, parking, etc.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's really interesting seeing talk therapy described as almost antithetical to taking actual steps to improve your life.  A good therapist, imo, is one who won't just let you wallow or overanalyze every moment of every negative experience (something I'm prone to do). They'll encourage you to find ways to take that insight and make it actionable, so you're not just left with more awareness of your experiences and how they've impacted you.  I always say I hit the therapy jackpot because I adore mine, and she's always pushed for me to actively improve my life as much as I contemplate it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Or maybe it’s the mere fact that life is pretty much unaffordable right now because it doesn’t matter if you have a degree we can’t even make ends meet with our salaries, or the fact that groceries get even more expensive as months go by, or car payments are very pricey too and you can’t rely on minimum wage as you maybe could 10 or 20 years ago because we’re living a recession. I still live with my parents not because I want to, but because it doesn’t matter if I work two jobs, I still don’t earn enough to make it out of here, because rent is simply way too expensive. (And finding a job has become really hard too because no one is hiring)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 20 never really dated, don’t know how to socialize, don’t want to drive. Have no self-esteem, and high anxiety due to bullying and trauma. I even been neglected since grade 4. I started making my own lunches and would barely see my mom. This got worse till I was in grade 9. I would go to school with my durag on and was late like 150 times in grade 7. My mother never made me do my homework even though the parent interviews told her to. I was allowed todo whatever I wanted as a kid which I appreciated, but was always grounded for making a mistake given chores which lead to me hating doing the dishes. I’m more independent than most, but at the same less independent due to my emotional trauma . I can make my own food, but an impulsive buyer because I never got to get the stuff I wanted as a kid. I live with my grandparents now due to my mom becoming more emotionally abusive. I still ask for second opinions before I make big decisions, but slowly getting better at being more independent.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Decent video but the focus on the coddling of gen z is blown out of proportion. Most older gen z is seriously trying everything they can
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a gen z teenager. I WANT to get married, have babies, buy a house. But I literally can’t. I’ve been working full time since senior year in high school. Have been saving most of what I make and STILL don’t have enough to buy a condo and get married. My boyfriend works as a mechanic for a big company and even he has a hard time making enough.   If the economy was better. We’d be married and moved out. But alas that’s not viable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im 22 and i agree. Im going no where in life right now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Gen Z kid who made it, the situation is just bad and I'm doing ok because I experienced homelessness in highschool and the lessons I learned then helped me thrived. Though it feels insane to say outloud when a lot of my friends that went to universities, had full time jobs earlier than me, went into trades, and should have had more of a future than me. I was more comfortable with abandoned homes, poor living conditions and having no one to save you (literally wasn't even eligible for food stamps or Medicaid). Now I own a home I'm fixing up, have a retirement and student debt relief from my job, make enough to cook anything I want, survived stage 2 cancer and the only advice I can give anyone my age is: get uncomfortable, live like you're homeless if you aren't already, never engage in capitalism directly and humble yourself through complete humility; which is insane advice when the topic is living in America and not joining a monk village in the mountains.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm about to be 31; I still live with my folks, and I'm going back to school. I can I only manage one class per semester while I work. I'm trying my best to trust the process and not burnout, but I cannot help but feel my independence is stunted in one way or another.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have a chronic condition the causes inflammation in the lining of my bladder and urethra. I basically am waking around with UTI symptoms all the time while not having a UTI. I went to the emergency room because I was afraid of getting a kidney infection from what I thought could have been a UTI. Come to find out, I don’t have Medicaid anymore. No warning. I was told I had to pay out of pocket. I was just laid off from a good job. No 401k. And since I work part time at a gas station, I don’t qualify for unemployment. The ER visit was just for an IV and for them to tell me I need to see a Urologist. In total, the visit with the doctor plus the water and sodium they gave me totaled up to 1,500$. Which I can’t pay. And I’m not going to. And I can’t see a urologist either because I can’t afford it.  I live with my boyfriend in a one bedroom that costs 1,000$ a month and I’ve been out of the house since 18. Life has its ups and downs sure, but so far it’s just been going downhill.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Dated a girl last year that was BIG hanging onto childhood. Couldn’t drive, no college prospects, just living at home and having her parents (and me) drive her around everywhere. It felt like I was hanging out with a 22 year old teenager… legitimately got uncomfortable because she was so emotionally immature that she seemed 16. It was crazy 😭😭😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We’re not really criticizing young people for not wanting to drink? Come on. My gen was full of blackout alcoholics before they were even age 21
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For me personally I've held off on getting a car because it doesn't fit my lifestyle and the cost is insane. I work fully remote so I have no commute, and uber/public transic  can be used when I do need to get around. And getting a car involves at least 1k a month in car payment, insurance, parking, gas. It's not sustainable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm an older Gen Z-er. My parents were immigrants, abusive and neglectful - I received a weird parenting mix of being completely neglected and also being controlled/over "protected". I have multiple university degrees, I landed a good full time corporate career straight out of uni, and earn more than my parents only 3 years out from uni and yet I can't afford anything due to wages not keeping up with inflation/the cost of everything else increasing.  I live trapped at home because I can't afford to rent and my savings for a house keep tanking because I have to pay $$$$ to sort out medical issues I'm having. My parents gave me an incurable, painful, expensive genetic disorder and its 10 times worse now due to the lack of early medical intervention as a child. It unfortunately won't even outright kill me, just make me miserable for as long as I live.  I'm fucking up constantly at work now because of my medical issues and inability to work,  I'm losing all of my hair, but I can't quit because I need to pay my medical costs and bills. I feel stunted and trapped. There is no point in life.  While some of the points in this video contribute, I think it's so out of touch and insane to contribute it all to this and not the majority to the awful economic times we live in. Young people cant land well paying jobs so they can move out and work and experience adulthood on their own. They dont drive because cars are expensive and they can't afford them and upkeep.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This hits different when you’re about to graduate and choosing a career that pays well but am not sure if I’ll like it 10 years from now….
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And im the oldest child in my family. So my 3 younger siblings are all solidly gen z. And they grew up in the exact conditions that I did.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: fr n we also felt the repercussions of the 2008 crisis. i was born in 2005 in eastern europe so for example 9/11 didn’t directly affect me, however the recession was so bad in my country, it was one of the most affected ones. my dad couldn’t find a full time job until around 2013. my first memory is from when i was 3 n we had just moved to the outskirts of my city due to not being able to live close to the center anymore. me n my brother’s room was almost completely empty, aside from a little table with a crt tv that had tape on it’s speakers cuz it was too loud n was demagnetized on the left side n a sack of toys that had a few plushies we were gifted. i was sitting on the floor eating while watching curious george, at the time we slept with our parents on a sponge “mattress” that was meant for wall isolation.  all generations are far more complex than the reductionist stereotypes that are imposed upon them n its frustrating to see so little empathy from older generations yk.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For what it’s worth, I’m looking into somatic therapy for my issues precisely because talk therapy hasn’t done enough for me after trying it for many years.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: jfc this is bleak. glad you're doing better though
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I also experienced homelessness in high school as a Gen Z teen. Still coming out of the rough from that but God's been good.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Get comfortable with being uncomfortable" and "pride goes before destruction" was some of the most important lessons that I've learnt. I'm glad seeing a person who made it and have those common traits !
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't think living with parents counts as stunned independence in some ways.I loved living with my folks when I worked and went to school. It was only for a few years but it felt great to spend time with them as an adult. That middle ground where you're not too young and your parents aren't too old is... Really valuable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @sophiec8330  People don't think about this until they're so old or dying.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don’t really think living with your parents is a big deal as people make it out to be. They are your family. It’s an American thing to be like yo dude you’re 18 time to gtfo. Other countries they stay together and support each other.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @erin6220 It's funny because most of the ppl I know who were able to move out young come from upper middle class households.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @erin6220  Yeah, telling overseas friends about this and they're all thinking I'm crazy because living with family is totally normal everywhere else outside the US.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Good luck with school. There's not a doubt in my mind that higher education will help ya out. However when I'm lookin for jobs and I see that some of them require  a master's degree while only offering 40k a year has made me highly jaded towards education in general
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is almost my exact same scenario. I feel you and I relate. Best of luck.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Try to focus on the end goal / objective. If it helps, it's really only the US where we have this weird expectation where everyone needs to be moved out of their home. In the rest of the world, multigenerational households are plentiful.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We don't grow in our comfort zones. Glad you have these options available to you, but when we are too comfortable we don't pursue hardships.  Challenge yourself.. you have everything working in your favour, push the envelope a bit more.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @warrenpeace2111  Total lie, "comfort zones" are not real. No one "pursues hardships" either, that's more nonsense. People live to do fun things and once you can't, there is no reason to live anymore.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I wish cringe culture would just come out and declare drinking to be cringe (which it is)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You may not need a car, but it helps to get a driver's license anyway. Much like martial arts and first aid, it never hurts to collect skills even if you never hope to use it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Avoid getting a car if you can, but try to get your license; it’s useful to have in a pinch.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same boat as you. But like the other peeps suggested, I definitely think getting a license is worth it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m. 41 got my first job in mid 20s (immigrant) no college . You aren’t supposed to know your entire life path just work on it day to day . I’m 41 and still no clue where I’ll end up
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ElinWinblad  this is so true. I hate that people with underdeveloped brains are pressured into knowing their full path to life by 18. Ughhhhhhh 😫
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @ElinWinblad  Yeah unfortunately that's not what we get told
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: But then you'll make a change 10 years from now. Or 5 years from now. It's okay. I'm 40 I'm on my third career and you know what they have all been pretty fun. You don't have to have your whole life figured out at graduation. Any job is a good job while you figure basic stuff out.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @burgeaccount  So glad you wrote this!!! I'm also 40 and on my 3rd career and was about to say that....ya look at it in 10 years IF that problem comes. I never look at my life choices as bad but I've had the opportunity of living 3 different lives...how wonderful that I have had the opportunity to have these 3 different careers and live in these different places (sure there was bad stuff...but that's life). We will also never know if we made the right choice....make a choice, stick to it, until life forces you to make another choice and another choice. And the cool thing about work.....after about 1 yr, a job is job, you go make money come home and take care of yourself...put in some hardwork, and save a bit, until other opportunities arise or you sort stuff out
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You can always change careers later. If you don’t like your first career after 5-10 years it’s far from “too late” for a change. People go to med school in their 40s. Don’t feel locked into a choice you made when you were 18.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Then you pivot to a field where your skills can transfer or start over and pick something else. I didn’t start my career till I was 29.   As long as you know what to do, you have the tenacity, resilience, and drive to stick with it no matter the odds, that you will fight to get where you want to be… then it’s easy to pivot in life if another career is calling…  Or you can do like I do and have a duel career!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Is it that we don't want to do these things or that they are non affordable and out of reach for the average teen-young adult?   Who in their right mind would spend their money on getting their license + their own car + insurance + gas instead of just.. using public transport? Or relying on their parents?  Where I live, insurance for drivers under 25 is much much more expensive so why would we rush and spend the money we get on our minimum wage job on something we don't completely need? There are other alternatives in the end and, seeing the state of the world and the economy, I would say it is much wiser to wait and save up. At least so you can rent a crappy apartment somewhere. But sure, it's the youth that don't want to work, we are the ones that are afraid of taking these steps.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The economists who gaslight us by telling us this is the strongest economy ever are a huge part of the problem. Their obsession with GDP and flawed methodologies in calculating true inflation and unemployment is absolutely horrendous.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is out of touch.. people are quick to judge gen z without even trying to understand what factors we’ve grappled with at a MUCH younger age then our predecessors
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I had a coddled childhood and I do think I developed learned helplessness as a result.  I was seriously depressed. Moving out for law school was the best thing that happened to me because I finally gained the courage and know how to manage my own affairs. Huge boost in self-confidence.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In 1999 my school drivers training program was free when i was there in 2018 it was $350 💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 21 and feel directionless. I'm in collage, about to transfer to get my bachelors and even then the past three years of school have been one hell of a ride. There were many times I thought about changing my degree to something more worth it and something I won't regret in the future...and makes me money. I'm an English major which is my passion. But at this point I know passion isn't going to pay the bills. I want a stable income. And while I always planned to get my bachelors part of me is lowkey going just so I can have purpose in my life. Like "Oh, the reason I don't have this or I'm not doing that is because I'm so busy with school" type of thinking. I'm living at home, not working since it's been so hard to hear back from employers and while it's never been an issue and my parents are okay with me being home I feel a constant nagging in my head that I'm not the adult I should be at this age. By my age my mother was married and had a two year old with her own aparment and car. While I can't even get my permit and don't see myself living in my own place for years at this point. But with all that said, I still have hope for my future but there are some days where everything feels so bleak and aimless.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: One side of this it’s “we would if we could navigate this society a lot easier” and the other is “how dare we adults have any fun outside of booze and 18+ stuff or god forbid don’t conform to the societal norms”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What a coincidence, Im sitting in my car on the job site because my coworker wanted me to cool off after lashing out over nothing because of my pent up frustration with how little agency I have in my own life!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 23 and none of this applies to me, (except for living at home but I’m doing it to save up money for my future.. technically I could move out with my salary but I’d much rather have free rent, lol) but it just goes to show that averages are just averages- and they don’t necessarily describe even as much as 25% percent of the population
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a gen z person, I have gotten my Master's degree, I am swamped in that debt, I haven't applied for a job because its filled with 10,000 other applicants or bots (dime toss on any given time on which one's which), being in school for most of my life until now, and then being told to go get a job without figuring out where I myself want to go.  Compounding all of that with people who snark on men, men getting demoralized from the snark because of how society nowadays devalues men and puts horrible double standards on them, and then turn around and blame men for not getting a girl and doing traditional things?   When you have a society that refuses to shame people for bad behavior, labels trying and failing as "cringe" and "bad", blames men for all their woes when its far more nuanced than that, and has an entire generation of children now adults, shamed and belittled for having the audacity to be creative and try new things, there's no wonder why we have "no drive" etc. People from the schools have told us creativity and out of the box thinking is bad, having different views is bad, that if you don't follow x/y/z standards is bad.  And then you have an unemployment and housing crisis, and economic rescission going on on top of all that?        But of course, all of that gets ignored.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hear you but the milestones for adulthood are different now. A lot of things that have been seen as milestones are simply not worth it anymore. You mentioned driving and starting a family. Driving is not a requirement of adulthood and it is expensive depending on what car situation you have, where you live, etc. A lot of people in previous generations have started families when they shouldn’t have and had way too many kids that they couldn’t afford or support. I don’t think it’s fair to see gen Z’s “delay” into adulthood as a delay at all. They have a deeper view of adulthood and the impact of their actions in their own lives and they hesitate because they should. I think the anxiety of making a decision or making the right decision about what to do with their lives is only because people are asking them to make a decision without also acknowledging the economic and quality of life impacts of these decisions.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s hard to have hope right now. Most jobs are soulless, meaningless, and underpaid plus it’s just hard to land anything. I’ve been working full time and trying to go to school from 17-23 and I got almost nothing to show for it. I don’t even know where to pivot. I used to have so much hope and excitement for the future. Now I wonder how I’ll sustain myself and build a life. Also, anytime I start saving a good amount of money, I suddenly get hit with car problems or something or work slows down. That’s another thing, as a construction worker who relies on new builds, the housing market and interest rates have fucked me. No one’s buying houses which means every residential project is at a practical standstill until they sell a set number of home. Overall I have some hope as it’s necessary but it’s really hard to see a path forward from my limited perspective. Hard to be motivated. Anywhosies, good luck everyone😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is really interesting, and I'd like to give an inside perspective. I'm 18, I have depression, and am considered to be on the "low/mid functioning" side of autism (cursed with being smart in the classroom, and terrible when it comes to interacting with people). I haven't had a traditional job yet because it's almost impossible for me to get a job, both with my disabilities and with the current state of the job market. Since we were little, gen z has been told "you can do/be anything", until we can't.  Most Gen Z will never achieve higher things because it is constantly being reinforced that trying isn't worth it. Nothing we do is ever enough. We will never be enough. At the end of the day, I'll still be disabled and miserable, so why try? No wonder I don't want to be an adult! I don't want to face the fact that this is my reality.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I lied on all my job applications.  That's how I got in.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I agree public policy and a lack of independent 3rd locations for kids is a silent contribution . When I was 10 I could walk to the park with my friends to play by ourselves, we just had a curfew. Today the same park has a "no unsupervised kids" rule, and I imagine parents don't want to risk a call home from the park ranger or local police.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i dont make enough to live by myself, how can i completely be independant? i would just be homeless
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: GenZ issues in America:   1. Can't afford a home to stay 2. Can't afford groceries  3. Doesn't see the necessity of everyone owning a car when public transport can be done in one of the RICHEST countries in the world.  4. Get shamed for living with their parents when rich kids automatically do live with parents. It ain't independence, it's "I don't have money to fund you anymore kiddo".  4. Rent is expensive af and has several requirements like salary should be 2-3x rent amount.  5. Laws are extremely strict for innocents and extremely lenient for illegal immigrants. Like wtf!  6. H1-B guys exists and get the preference because of "cheap labour". Locals aren't happy, H1-B guys aren't happy.  7. AI robots replacing humans without a second thought of where the humans should go...without government giving a backup plan besides corporate and running a business. I'm sorry, but GenZ deserves more options other than freelance and side gigs.  8. Jobs don't provide 401k benefits, health benefits, decent salary. They provide hustle culture (work till you drop) , rotation shifts, barely any pay rise, etc.  9. Food Quality is trash now, Period products are sh*t expensive and women are going through alot of fertility issues.  10. Hookup culture and online dating issues are more now then ever. Everyone grinds into everyone's brain that you don't need love, you need your dreams and goals. Making GenZ more lonelier than ever.   If the government, rich folks, celebrities, CEOs don't do ANYTHING besides themselves. Majority of us will not have basic necessities like shelter, food, water, transport,healthcare,etc.  I'm sorry ma'am, but as an American person who lived in a developing country like India, America actually needs to catch up and understand than GenZ doesn't need pretty buildings and pretty hospitals from Government. GenZ deserves basic needs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Older generations ruined younger generations lives. That’s why we’re tapped out.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video made me feel so seen. The biggest thing I've had on my mind is, more decisions, more options is NOT better. I feel like there are too many options, too many decisions, too many potential partners (aka the dating app phenomenon). I feel this way and I don't even struggle with decision paralysis!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Reading this makes me wonder if the UK specifically is bad for driving costs or if I’ve been ripped off. Average driving lesson cost is like £30/hr, I was quoted £3k for a year of car insurance on an 10 year old car with a tiny engine, which would cost me £2.5k, then I’d have to pay for petrol and road tax and emissions tax, it ended up being like £6k over the course of a year, which would be insane on my shitty £25k minimum wage salary. It’s not financially feasible
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @fuwameanssoft  Sounds cheaper than where I am. I didn't factor in all costs. In my state in the usa, having a car costs anywhere from $8k to $12k a year, but this all depends on if one has a car payment which the majority of people do (even used cars these days cost $10k so someone may still need to put it on a payment plan).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Driving is a skill, and it never hurts to collect skills. You don't need to own a car to be licensed for one. But you'll likely need it to get around in developing locales where upward economic potentially really exists -- most prominently in places where two wheels is often preferable to four -- and where public transit usually isn't.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @doujinflip idk if it's different where you live but at least in my country, you have to pay to have driving lessons. I think in America your parents can just teach you but not here. And those classes are expensiveeee so no, it's not just a skill, it's something else you have to pay for. I'm not saying it's not good to learn but let's be honest, the average teenager / young adult (im mostly talking about uni students and those working minimum wage jobs) can't afford to pay for those classes.  Also what do you mean when you say 2 wheels are preferable to 4 like could you give me an example? /gen
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @doujinflip  I live in America. "Collecting skills" is not free. Driving school is required. Back in 2018, mine was $375 and I had to pay out of pocket with my minimum wage job in high school. I was just lucky that my mom gave me her old car because she wanted to upgrade. I still use that 2008 car to this day. I am pretty sure that driving school costs a lot more now. Drivers license test, Car registration, VEIP testing, inspections, car insurance, all cost as well. Car registration in my state is $120 and you have to do it every year. Car insurance is like $200 a month in my area for my age group
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not generations. Just one. The boomers legit had the best time. After them, its all been fucked.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Boomers in particular, especially now that they're practically all retired and literally have all day to get indoctrinated and lobby and vote for their interests accordingly. There's a reason that education and young family welfare always gets gutted to salvage the budget for senior benefits and ownership tax breaks.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @yosh6278 Nope. Older generations have all the power in pretty much every field. They just refuse to let it go to someone else without it being pried from their wrinkled, greedy hands.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @yosh6278You’re too old to be using the word lol, be mature
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For me at 23, I feel like my parents and the economy play the biggest roles in this. I just got my license at 22 because they were afraid of me driving for the longest time. They're furious that I've accepted a full-time job at my workplace, because they're saying its too much, despite the fact I've already graduated and don't have anything else going on. They track my location, spam my phone about where I'm going or why I'm out so late (late being 8pm). I often have to just lie about where I'm going, until I get their angry phone calls later while I'm driving. It's not that I'm ungrateful of everything they've done for me, and I do love them, but I feel like their anxiety is holding me back. If everything today was affordable, then I'd absolutely move out and establish more independence. However, everything's so expensive, I just feel like my financial situation's also keeping me trapped in my home bubble.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm barely Gen Z/Millenial (Zillenial).  29, make almost $70k USD, I have money saved up to move, and a good credit score. I WANT to move out, but I'm having issues getting into an apartment because a lot of places are asking for references for rental history, which I don't have.  I wanted to move out years ago, but it's expensive as hell. "Just move somewhere cheaper" I need a job offer to do that. I applied to like 300 jobs and had a few interviews over 6 months, I actually was offered a job, but it was part-time with no guaranteed hours and only possibly full-time down the road, I declined because my current job pays a lot more.  I'm personally 105% ready to move out and basically have everything I need to do so except an apartment LOL. Fuck this planet.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Man that 26 year old just put me on blast only difference with me is that I'm not on social media and my biggest fear that's keeping me somewhat complacent is having all those things yet not having my life together financially
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Like 90% of people I ask “Who was your role model” have none. Because everyone in their life didn’t have the effort to do what they wanted or needed to do because they were stuck in life. At a certain point you can’t risk things anymore. And the next generation grows up with that as the standard. Then have a feedback loop of energy sucking choices unless something or someone rare happens
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Part of this reminds me when I was between 14-16 I really really wanted to get a job, & I understand why but my parents said no. So by time I was more independent and allowed to get a job I was terrified to do it, so anxious so stressed, when just a few years earlier I was ready and excited for the responsibility. It's pretty interesting how things can change and shape you like that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: To the driving thing... I think there's more nuance there. I'm a millennial and where I grew up, almost no one had a driver's license or even a permit at 16. Parents and/or kids just couldn't afford to buy a car for their kid, much less pay for the insurance or gas. All those things are far more expensive now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Getting your licence was one of the biggest milestones, no more reliance of parents for transport, the whole city was in reach."  I got my licence but im pretty sure they dont just provide you a car with it:D. But correct me if im wrong
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: a combination of chronic nostalgia and cost of living increasing makes me feel like i’ve been 16 for 5 years….my mom and boyfriends mom were having whole children at my age (bad idea but still) and i cannot afford an apartment with 2 jobs
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a gen z I genuinely think that Humans have a form of Zoochosis. Everybody is drained and nobody can live the life they want. The cracks are already starting to show themselves
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I didn't choose not to grow up, the free market decided that rent and car insurance is too much for me and jobs not wanting me to work. Who am I to argue with the free market?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a millennial, I also lived at home until I was 26 while I went to college, then grad school, then found a full time job after graduation. Some might say that's "delayed adulthood," but it helped me save money for my first car, put money aside to move out, and also helped pay down some of my student loan debt. I don't think it set me back because by 32 I was married, had a solid career, and had paid off my college debt. There's nothing wrong with soft launching into a world that isn't exactly welcoming to the young.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why does it feel like every video you put out it so obscenely relevant to my life specifically at that time, the semblance is CRAZY
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m not hesitant I literally can’t find work, I’d love to move out and be independent but the economy literally won’t let me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a millenial and the only reason I was ever able to move out of my parents house when I turned 27 was because I got married. Working full time was never enough to afford my own place all throughout my 20’s. It’s depressing as hell. I’m 32 and not happy with the way my life turned out but I’ve accepted it and I’m just trying to live day by day and be happy with the small things.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think there's a few main problems:  1. Cringe culture — caring is "cringe", having hobbies is "cringe", making any mistakes whatsoever (required for learning anything) is "cringe". Although we're not seeing this as openly anymore, the effects of cringe culture still has its effects.  2. Excuses being really easy to make nowadays, and even being rewarded over putting in the effort. For example, we've all heard the story that you need to be born with "talent" to even try to make art (not even to be good at it — just to make it).  3. The expectation for your hobbies to also be something you're amazing at and marketable. Rarely does anyone create just for fun.  4. It's easier to just shut your brain off and relax with no effort nowadays. In the past, there were books, but you would eventually get bored and want to do something else. Now, people go on their phone to relax and never get bored. This pushes them to not do anything.  5. Poor mental health, particularly the loneliness epidemic and lack of purpose.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have a rather unique mindset, if I think to long I almost always Yolo it

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ya the driving thing is real like I am 20 and my mom always tell me please learn to drive but I tell her why we don't have any cars😢 it's just so confusing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: AS Gen z myself - it's this weird middle ground for a lot of people ; everyone I have known and met have not been coddled,have not had supportive parents in the slightest. Thats not to say that other people haven't just personally or even online I have never come in contact with anyone like that. As well as we grew up after 9/11 and seeing so much unfiltered violence from school shootings to seeing the news video of the towers every single year in classrooms,as well as things on the news. Most people I know do not care bc there has been so much violence that people do not care,as well as economic things.   As well as those of us who have cars,apartments and are married with kids can not do that on our own and usually need parents help-which again bc a lot of have not grown up in healthy enviroments its not an option. It's not like we do not want these things. We do. Desperately. We want to go out with our friends. We want to enjoy ourselves but if we do that we are giving into wealthy corporations that do not care about us,so it is also a moral dilemma of if we want to have fun and ignore morals or if we want to stay in and respect our morals.  Its also being burnt out and tired from everything,bc it seems that all we see is bad things,from economic to morals to not being able to buy tomatoes without knowing the person who picked them is not being paid fairly-but also not being able to afford  to live by our morals and feeling awful for things like that. We can barely afford to buy shein basics but then we feel awful for buying that but we can't really afford to buy anything else.   It's everything. From not having parents to lean on,to not having jobs,to not having things to do...people thing we don't care but we care so much it is killing us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: try a roommate as a stepping stone to make up for your lack of history maybe and then from there you can look at your own place after? there are facebook groups locally you can join and post in if you don’t have a roommate in mind.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like what you’re saying about therapy is dangerous. If you need therapy then you need therapy. I have PTSD and tried to “keep calm and carry on” for three or four years. It impacted every area of my life and kept me from my dreams. I’ve been in therapy since 2021 and I could have never built my resilience without therapy. Therapy is hard work. It’s not just complaining and doing nothing about your issues. your brain deserves therapy when it’s sick the same way your body deserves therapy when it’s injured.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's so weird because I never met a Gen Z who wasn't the main character
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 42 and found a therapist who specializes in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. It helped contextualize problems and give me the ability to work through them myself instead of having my therapist do it for me. When he went on paternity leave for a month, I didn't feel the need to reach out to him at all. But then again my mom and best friend died within a month of each other and I just had to raw dog that trauma for 15 years. Like learning to swim by being thrown into the deep end of the pool. I have been trying to get my wife to learn the same tactics that worked for me, but it's been a struggle. She has that same decision paralysis discussed in this video. She went on a solo meditation retreat with no cell service so I hope that she takes that opportunity to disconnect to shed her ego and work through some of the stuff her fast paced brain wouldn't let her address when she was in the real world.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Older generations had the idea that their system will never fail (apart from the Soviet block ig). People born after the 2000s have seen that the old trusted systems aren't immune to collapsing and can do it in a matter of days or even hours. This sense of stability that has been snatched away from us has resulted in the majority having a pessimistic viewpoint of the world and trying to do something or build something feels vain to the point of stupidity.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i felt this girl having an existential crisis over a yogurt. I’m 29 and 5 years ago i was feeling the exact same way. i guess it’s the stage every young adult should experience.  you’ll figure it out eventually, don’t worry ❤

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Great points. I would love to see more videos about these types of topics as a 21 year old gen z who is seriously feeling frozen in life and fear for my future.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not every therapy is about “developing skills and moving on”—let alone in any time-limited sense. While, yes, this does mean therapists need to make sure they are practicing ethically and that patients need to be aware of when they’re no longer benefiting from therapy. Nonetheless, there’s people who do need 10+ years of therapy, often people with lifelong/chronic mood/psychological/personality disorders. Of course, they usually are also taking medication and receiving other supportive treatments, which should see them not be required to pursue regular talk therapy sessions, but life is complicated…  I do think your therapy section of this video was more harmful than helpful. The push for shortened time-limited therapies is often to benefit pharmaceutical companies and marketizing mental health into just another quick-fix product to be consumed (while paying the therapists even less money and robbing the clients of quality care).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Dang, I've felt extremely heard in this. I'm constantly spinning because I don't know how/what to choose.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am literally begging my generation to pick up a book and go outside, it's such an antidote to this. Reading leads to curiosity, and finding what you're curious about is a crucial first step to finding the life you want. Going outside makes the world feel real again. Visit your Library, find a book that interests you, and get your a** to a park. Please.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im 37, I went through the exact same thing. Everyone ignored me by saying "you're young!" and "you can be anything!" or "you're so smart!" I know the future is in shambles, i will never tell my kids they are wrong for being worried or concerned about the future. Everything I was concerned about 15-20 years ago came true. University education equaled debt. Housing is unaffordable. There is little to no upward mobility unless you are willing to forgo all your morals and values. These were all problems back then , and are now 100x worse because most adults still refuse to acknowledge the reality we are all living in today. Good luck to everyone trying to survive out there!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When my oldest kid was 3, we taught her how to get her own breakfast. Every morning she'd wake up on her own, climb out of bed, make herself breakfast,  eat, and clean up after herself. Now shes nine and baking cakes in the oven
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z isn't just 21 the oldest of us are 28 now!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: just found this channel a few days ago, and it's been a nice companion for what feels like a potential slide into the end times 😌
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I wasnt allowed to play outside in our yard by myself growing up, but every time I asked if they would come watch me so I could go play outside they would always get annoyed and say "Im busy right now" "not today" "maybe this weekend" and so i just didnt really get to go out. I couldnt have sleepovers unless my parents knew their whole family very well, yet they never felt like talking to/getting to know other kids parents. Everything I did on my phone they could see, even if it was deleted, and they read all my texts. They would always bombard me with questions, always be lecturing me about something im doing wrong, and being overly involved in every aspect of my life. They told me who I can and cant be friends with, what colors i can wear, what interests i should have. And now as an adult they wonder why I never go out, never spend time with them, and am not very social or trusting
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: A 16 year old doesn't have a permanent job because that's a literal impossibility in todays world.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My 16 yr old (a very young Gen z) is absolutely miserable.  And I know for a fact because he just consumes garbage content ALL FREAKING DAY.  We can shut off his phone, but then he'll just get on YouTube shorts on his TV or his school issued Chromebook.  Dopamine addictions are real.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There is a saying that goes: "Youth is when you want to change the world, age is when the world has changed you."  I think having my mum not interfere in my growth helped a lot. Like, she would let me do what I wanted within reason. (She would have interfered, in case it was something dangerous though...) She just rarely say no, instead she described the consequences for me and let me decide. That way I tried all sorts of things in my youth and early adulthood.   What I found out, that you don't necessarily have to pick one thing or the other. Sometimes you can pick several. Balancing them is the challenge, however it is doable, to some degree.  However, in order to succeed, you really need to experience failure and face rejection.   Sometimes getting a break from social media can help. It's all just smoke and mirrors anyway.  You can still go back, after you succeeded. But it might be a hindrance otherwise (unless you want to be a Youtuber, influencer, streamer or something along those lines).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've been growing some theories about childhood and how it affects adulthood through my own personal growth as a coddled child.   One theory is that the work we learn to do by watching and being involved with our parents allows for a boost in seratonin when doing it as an adult. For instance, as a child, I went to work with my dad on "daddy daughter day" multiple times where I was in his office, "working" on the computer aside him, filing paperwork, printing, making copies, faxing, etc. all day and now, to this day, I still get a rush doing things like this. The same goes for cooking and cleaning. I was given a job to complete these tasks each week and I still feel good doing the things that I was tasked to do as a child. I realized that we aren't making children "grow up too fast" by having them work alongside us, instead they are just understanding what it means to be a human and get things done (and this isn't a bad thing; reality is good because it is real).    Another theory is that using phrases that praise a child's intelligence or appearance don't do much other than teach the child that everything he or she is saying or doing as well as their appearance is their highest virtue. And this doesn't do much besides lay a foundation of disappointment in the future when they aren't beautiful to someone they want to be beautiful for or they aren't "smart enough" to follow a conversation or gain a position. Learning skills through their own means instead of through praise will take them much further in life because they won't have the stress of comparison weighing on them.  I have more theories, but they're still cooking
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 10:38 I feel so validated. My husband and only plan to have 1 child, and I have to tell my husband when i see parents with multiple kids they have no choice but to trust their 3 year old to stay close by while they juggle a baby. But my husband does not trust our kid outside of arms length and he definitely coddles and helicopter parents when we are at the park. And this is the result of having one child and being overly protective.   I'm also surprised you didn't mention the concept of quarter life crisis which is what is happening to Gen Z which is common. Multiple generations once they hit 23-25 you have a quarter life crisis because the career you thought you wanted isn't quite fulfilling and the reality of the world kind of hits you. A lot of adults don't settle into what they actually want to do until their 30s. So many people in their late 30s and 40s have careers that are completely different from what they started out with in their 20s. I'm a millennial I've been telling my Gen Z friends who are freaking out, it's normal, you'll figure it out. We all do :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The Tik tok at 32:01 is so iconic, it should be a theater monologue honestly. Amazing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People are starting to wake up, and our Oligarchial overlords don't like that. Think about it: Not having kids means more money and time for you, that's why there's all these articles from older gens complaining that younger generations "aren't having kids."   Live life for yourself as much as possible.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This made me feel so relieved that I have a great resume and really enjoy my career at 26. I'm not rich, but I'm happy. That is priceless.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 29, married, and forever stuck in an apartment with used cars. I have decent credit because I've never bought anything with it before but houses and cars are obscene. There is no hope in sight.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My Girlfriend and I just had a mutual break up today and we are perfect for each other, make over $150k combined per year but we realized we won’t have enough time to save for purchasing a house and start a family. Bottom line is the economy is causing most issues seen in gen z
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 25:49 I think your take on therapy was a bit off. There are people of all generations who are genuinely traumatized (to different degrees). Trauma can hold people back in different ways. So yes some may go through all the milestones of adulthood but then me a complete menace to the people in their lives. Also supporting your argument with quotes from Abigail Shrier is a CHOICE. 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a younger gen z and I just turned 16 and I’m actively trying to do the things that no one wants to do anymore like I want to get my license I want to have a job and I want to start saving up to buy a car and go to college but I’m not allowed too my mom holds me back and makes up every excuse in the book saying i can’t and still treats me like a little kid to the point I myself can’t believe i’m going to be an adult in 2 years, sometimes I think are gen is like this because are parents can’t except there getting older and that then projects onto us as we grow up and realize that we are actually adults and not kids anymore
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In the UK, the NHS also practices the "developing skills and moving on" therapies as standard for every single patient (need to stretch that government money somehow) and it's a massive reason why so many working-age adults are on disability for mental health here. The healthcare system just wants you in and out of the door as fasts as possible in order to check a box regardless of whether or not you need more than just a quick-fix.  If there was more funding for mental healthcare (current "left-wing" government refuses to raise billionaires' taxes 🤡) then we would be able to offer patients more robust long-term treatment options with lower chances of relapse but nooo that's too complicated for our short-sighted politicians.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Reading is one of my favorite hobbies. The thing about hobbies though, is that everything Gen Z does that doesn't make them money or help them towards a more stable future is criticized by both peers and adults. Every hobby/skill people do is expected to somehow be monetized or else you're never going to make it in life. When I was a kid, I'd be reading three books a week because I had the time to. In high school, I'd read under my desk instead of paying attention to class. I got lucky. I grew up with a fantastic public library and school library. Then I moved to the south. The school library was okay though I saw a total of maybe 10 people check out books when I was there (usually for class, so they didn't have to buy it). The local one? Was about the size of a living room and had about one shelf of YA novels. Libraries are being defunded, parks are no longer spaces for anyone above the age of 10, and going anywhere costs money (either gas or public transport). Also, libraries are under attack. Books and knowledge are about to become a luxury (given a hardcover book is like 20-30 bucks now). The quality of books is also going downhill fast due to BookTok and AI.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That sounds very lonely - the 3 year old having breakfast alone every day, I mean.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@mailill nah, she woke up at 5:30 and was hungry. After that she'd usually crawl into my bed or play with her dolls
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @walmart_ricecrispytreat for teaching their child to develop a sense of independence? Yeah I’d say that warrants one
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @AshleyEmbers  😆 I don’t think it’s all doom and gloom. I love this channel these videos feel like a sociological study on a generation while it’s still developing which is intriguing. I just wish gen z had more to look forward to or we had more solutions to the problems we’re facing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a millennial and I figured this out a long time ago. Even as a child myself, I could not fathom wanting to have (or take care of) children if I was already expected to do so much just to keep myself alive. I was called selfish and told every day that I would change my mind. I never did. Thank god for that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's what I've realized lately as well. If our generation has kids, we will be stuck in the rat race grind forever barely keeping our head above water. At least without kids I will have even a little time and money for myself.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've worked full time since I was 18 btw, always moved up everytime I changed jobs. There's just no way to win on a single full time income.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im gen z and it looks like once we stop buying all these useless products, fancy things we will get more money to survive
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Personally I was always the guy that like materialistic things but wasn't a addict buyer so that's how ppl save money
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen X here. Go into the trades. I’m commercial HVAC. 6 figure pay. I’m 51 your generation needs to see blue collar jobs as opportunities 😎
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jasondowns2510  Like that doesn't have nepotism too lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I know many boomers (my dad included) that acts like kids. And most were able to receive a middle-class lifestyle by barely trying by today's standard. Because life was just that easy for them so it never forced them to grow up. If they tried the same today, most would be homeless.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 12:30 THISSSS 🙏🏼🙏🏼 im gen z and when i was in highschool my dad would routinely pull up my grades on the family tv because "they cared about me and my grades and wanted me to do well" i told them this gave me anxiety and made it even harder to get work done.....anyway lets just say even just asking me how university is going gives me anxiety and im terrified of opening my school email to the point where I haven't checked it once in the 3 years I've been at college. I told them so many times let me do it on my own you're giving me anxiety and they always said they couldn't because of how it made them feel like a bad parent
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I turn 21 in less than two months and I feel very scattered with everything. I’m independent with a lot of things and I don’t need help, but I am terrified of driving. Even if I were driving it’d be a nightmare to keep up with financially. I’m being told I’m behind, but if I’m trying to move in with my partner I’m going too fast. I changed my mind about my major and taking on a new one now requires an extra year of college that I don’t have money to pay for. Everything costs so much I just want everything to stop but I know that I can’t. As annoyed as I am with people younger than me by like 2 years for doing far less and being more dependent, I also can’t blame them to a certain extent. This world is exhausting and difficult to keep up with and it’s overwhelming.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This episode just gives you a whole life perspective. Truly grateful for this amazing content
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 26:20 thats because you need medication usually as well; medication to alleviate the physiological symptoms and therapy to safely learn about dealing with what happened. If you can break the link between the event(s) and the physical response, you can find homeostasis and distance. Its an issue of therapists not being educated on how to help us—lots of us are very self aware, and that's new for therapists. We are higher educated, and more impotent, its a systemic faillure and to place all the blame on gentile parenting (a millenial tactic mind you, not all our parents) is unfair. Its 100% a socio-economic issue
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 26 and burned out. I can’t find meaning in going to work because it feels like I won’t ever be able to buy a house, corporate is extremely stressful. I studied and worked so I could get freedom, but I feel like you can’t buy freedom anymore. It’s out of the market.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey great videos but I do think that therapy is a lifetime thing for people struggling with conditions that need extra support.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Very inspirational! Especially the Would’ve should’ve could’ve part. Thank you!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: lol this vid is so tone deaf. we can’t ‘adult’ because we can’t afford it. our parents were buying houses at our age and now where i live anyway we need to save for 20 years from 18 to afford a house.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think that this is rather reflektiv in gen-z dating culture
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I thought the sluggish transition to adulthood now is bc a lot of milestones are priced out. I have old members that never even graduated high school and somehow got to just find a job, stuck with it, was able to afford rent, get a car and eventually just gained experience from jobs and promotions to buy a house, start a family… also older generations started responsibilities much younger. I witnessed and even heard! Straight from some parents now they just do it all or ignore teaching their kids bc “it’s just easier for now and they will be forced to figure it out anyway” which I see is delaying young adults and teenagers
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Flower - needs dirt Dandilion - "CONCRETE, F**K YEAH"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As someone who has recently been hit by a car while on my e-bike ( a month ago) he cut me off after he raced to get in front of me, THEY CAN'T DRIVE!  Dude was 17 and my ankle and knee are still messed up but the only luck I had was no broken bones no concussion so at least I got that going for me lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I moved out and got hit with 2 layoffs, 1 bankruptcy, 1 selloff and got sick with covid... just wonderous to live in this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a teacher, I think the education system of the last 10 years (especially since covid) has failed students. Children are now being raised to be completely sheltered, unable to deal with minor hardships without the system cocooning them. A student dealing with hardships complain and instead of teaching them resilience to overcome hardships (example, not getting a good grade), the system would blame teachers for making them fail and force us to put an inflated grade so the kid stops complaining. All of the schools i've worked in the last 10 years have had a minimum 50% grade even for students who literally do not complete any work. If I try to grade them lower, I get called in to explain myself (they don't even want to believe me, students and parents come first).   This has taught kids that all they need to do is complain, and act out hard enough and things will go their way. Creating stories and telling lies to get their way will make them successful. We have managed to completely separate school life from the real world. How do you think a person who grew up thinking this way will cope once they are in the work force?  Students can't even regulate the feeling of boredom anymore. We're seeing higher irritability and violence in kids nowadays. Schools have had it rough in the last decade and we're starting to see the same aggression and anxiety spill into college.   Let kids deal with life and learn to regulate themselves. It's unfair to expect them to magically be able to do it in adulthood. Education system is not about feeling good all the time, it's about learning to be a functional human. It's so hard to undo lesson learnt in childhood and teenage years. We're making kids more angry, apathetic and anxious by coddling them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Because with how expensive everything is and how impossible it is to actually live, we lost motivation to fight for a future
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im 25 and still live with my parents. There are several reasons why, but it's really not what I would prefer. It makes it more difficult trying to do almost anything. I have a job, but in 2 years there has been no growth 🤷‍♂️ and doesn't seem like it will happen
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just want to let people know that it is not that serious. I made friends with a guy I worked with. he started a whole new career at the age of 50. In his late forties, he got laid off. He and his wife decided it would be good for him to switch careers, and he went back to school and started at the help desk with me, who was just starting my career. When he got an opportunity to move over to sales, he took it, and it was really good for him. Good things happen, it is not the end of the world, you can change if you messed up and don't like your job, even late in your career.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Another thing is how gen z doesn’t want to spend their whole lives stuck with the same job for 60 years (probably more tbh) like the generations before, and this is completely understandable. It’s just upsetting how there aren’t many solutions to this. It’s all down to money. Capitalism is just fantastic, isn’t it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think maybe the stastic about people getting drivers licenses by 2021 having gone down has to do with the pandemic. I was 16 during the pandemic and my ass was going nowhere.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh no please don't feel that way. 21 is still young. No matter what people say, many people even in older generations have been there. Things will accelerate quickly in the next 5 years. Just be prepared for that. You'll get out of it and eventually miss the whirlwind
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: we used to just die.  I have a master's degree and really wish my disabled mom didn't try so I could die.   I hate the Neoliberal corporate society and its betrayal of science and humanity and find them hypocritical when they rely on the most comfortable default positions to hold mentally that are convenient for them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's also hard to compare generations directly as social scientists now have a sharper focus and awareness of their audience than ever before. For example, the last generation to suffer the consequences of the great depression are arguably the silent generation, possibly earlier, a time where it was hard to even compile data in the way we can nowadays. Baby boomers undeniably had it better than we did, so the closest comparison we have is late gen x (35+). I would say gen z and below do indeed tend to blame society for their woes instead of growing grit and getting used to it, but it's hypocritical for older gen X/Privileged millennials to critique Gen Z for reaction to an experience that they themselves never went through...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Totally. I definitely missed that side of it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 26 and living with my parents, took a year to find a job after graduating with a BSIT in 2021, and while it's challenging, I'm also approaching the 2-3 year sweet spot to transition to another job. Climbing internally isn't as feasible these days. Take advantage of the time you have with family and time to build financially. We can get through it!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​ @Webpelt I am french, and I am still with my parent, my mother specifically right now (not my dad, my parents are divorced).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just turned 27 last month and still live with my parents and grandparents because of their health issues and finances, it’s frustrating how much I can feel like I’m being treated like a child sometimes 😔 but I am thankful that I can reap the few benefits of living at home in such scary times (I only pay for my phone and car payments and Wednesday is my day to cook for us all)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: One of the staff at my college said: you can do it all, but not all at once. As someone who hates closing doors, this was very reassuring to me, you can go and open that door again later, you can change career down the line, you can try different things. Choose something and throw yourself into it, and if you change your mind later that's ok! Most doors don't have to stay closed. This thinking really helped me and idk if it'll help anyone else but I'm throwing it out there just in case 🫶
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Love the topic of the video, but seriously, a Scentbird sponsorship? 7:10
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just turned 35 in May, and it's the first time in my life I feel like an adult. People find that pathetic but idk what to tell you. I'm apparently middle aged but I feel like I JUST became an adult. I'm now starting to feel a huge difference between me and the older adults in my life. I hope I'm not alone in this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: there is no hope for us, better to spend our time trying to be happy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How can we expect children to grow resilience when the current state of the world is constantly demonstrating that nowhere is safe, even places that children have to go. I'm 20 now but i can remember the terror of going through active shooter drills for the first time, and now my 5 yo niece can recite all the places to hide in her kindergarten classroom when the bad person comes to hurt them. It's no surprise to me that people in my generation are scared of everything when even going to school could be deadly.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 30:14 decisions this, decisions that…… what decisions are we even talking about?? I make about 4 big decisions a YEAR. (And that’s coming from a 20 something that lives in a travel trailer across the country from my family!)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ive been watching these at 16 and 17 and I can’t help but wonder if I’ll also end up feeling the same way
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is a crisis that I am a part of
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen z is going through a lot right now and we’re still so young but at least we’re still young.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For me I dropped out of college after one and a half semesters after I realized I didn’t even know what I wanted to do as a career, got a job at a restaurant that doesn’t pay nearly enough, I still live at home, and have no chance of moving out. My friends are now graduating college, and they’re in worse financial straights than I am because many have college debt, can’t find a job their degree contributes to, and many also live at home working minimum wage service industry jobs just like me. I feel no motivation to join a four year college program because there’s no guarantee that investment of time energy and money will lead to anything, especially with how volatile our world is right now, and it seems like things are getting worse not better so why bet on a future that has zero guarantee of being there.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video found my feed at the exact moment in my daily routine when I question what I’m doing with my life and struggling with many things other gen Z do in this video…😮‍💨
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I agree with a lot, but this isnt our parents fault. Its the oligarchs fault. They got too greedy and here we are. Most of us in Gen Z have grown past blaming our parents for everythin. The reality is they protected us from a lot. Not everything but a lot. We have no future in this world unless we abolish billionaires. We abolish any form of greed wed be better off.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 37:00 oh, thanks for not ending it in a depressing note
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Baby millennial and I’m feeling a little misunderstood. I enjoy your videos and topics however this topic I watch regularly from economy based YT channels. I think because economics is the main reason people aren’t advancing as anticipated. why is there heightened anxiety and why is it most likely linked to the economy? I’m 6 minutes in and it feels like when my elder relatives yell at me while not actually understanding how the economy is effecting basic things. It’s all a chain reaction imo.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: WALF calls younger generation lazy and immature. Younger generation are meanwhile unable to get to where the WALF is at. Even when we do all the right steps, the career ladder doesn't exist anymore
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: all of the aspects you touched on this video are extremely superficial without considering the economic aspects that are behind literally everything and the reality of future, job market and honestly climate/resources situation the younger generations face. It's very easy to call Gen Z lazy, accommodated, spoiled and scared (which is what you did but with nicer words) and not get into the root of the problem.  You can't just separate things: social aspects and economic aspects walk hand in hand.   Also the Scentbird ad was insane. "Figure out who you are by buying a perfume subscription!" While this is exactly what people criticize about GenZ: "they have no personality outside of buying things and they don't know who they can be". The trends, the cores, the Klarna Labubus. Yet here they are, pushing products that can help define us. It was honestly disturbing to watch.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Growing up in dramatically awful times can't possibly have anything to do with their fear of decision-making right? As one young person told me during the pandemic, when trying to decide whether or not to go to Panera is deciding whether or not you might catch covid and kill someone that you love, how are you supposed to make a decision at all?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm sure it's virtually impossible to address every single possible reason why Gen Z is struggling to become confident and independent. But I find it disingenuous to say that sheltering is done from a place of love and care, like it's not also practiced in abusive households. A lot of these examples of "gentle parenting" I've been hearing in this video just seem like controlling behavior with "good intentions." What continued to bother me as the video progressed was, what about when this type of parenting is done with less than good intentions? Abuse isn't a particular generation's problem, more often than not it's passed down like some sort of twisted heirloom. I just found it troubling and a bit offensive to generalize an entire generation of people by a singular parenting style. And this frustration was exacerbated by the quotes you chose to cover, such as this snippet from Amy-Sarah Marshall at 16:11. "When we were kids, we had to go through tough times." Who is to say that Gen Z as a whole, has not gone through hard times? This entire video made it sound like Gen Z is solely made up of super sheltered and coddled children. Not once addressing the fact that difficult childhood's and enough traumatic experiences can create the same behavior you're criticizing, a lack of self esteem/direction, or fear of failure and fear of vulnerability. I'm not going to sit here and say with certainty that's why the entirety of Gen Z is struggling but it feels dishonest to not acknowledge this when specifically talking about upbringing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Can we maybe acknowledge that no other generations were raised with the internet before us? we literally are able to see all the horrible thinks happening in the world while trying to make a life of ourselves.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I grew up with an abusive helicopter parent, I was never allowed to walk to an elementary a cross walk away from my house or anything really independent without anyone.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Poor children know that they don't have options nor potential. I realized this when we could not get me into baseball even with a free lunch kids reduced price. I learned then that only kids with money have the potential to become an athlete, and that it was probably true for most things. I was in early elementary School. And every single year of my life reinforces that and makes it more bleak.   The only people that grow into adults still thinking that they had potential to have choice paralysis over, grew up with immense privilege and never were told no because of money.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @persomnus  yeah I didn’t even think about that. I really don’t have that many options and never have. What school am I going to go to? The local community college. What job am I going to get? The quickest one that will hire because I have to pay my bills.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Find something blue collar. Our entire generation was lied to about college, telling us we need to go to college to be successful and life a good life. You dont need college, find a skill, a trade that cant be phased out.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Blame the evil government and terrible cash here
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same here. Gen Z, 19.  I Still live with My strict parents, unfortunately. JUST got a job; Training tmrw. I got lucky. Still NO phone, No car Nothing. At this point, I basically have Nothing left to lose but my heartbeat and the clothes off my back. Half the Kids I know had jobs directly after virtual learning (10th grade). I will probably Not have Any real necessities for a while either, since prices rise, and I'm starting at Min. wage, full time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @unreelnigga  ouch, that sounds dreadful! We learn how to do things on our own  without parents coddling us through times we need to 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That stems from boomers who implemented laws that would jail or take kids away if they did normal things like walk to school 😢 boomers had all the freedom then decided to take that way from the next generations after
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Helicopter parenting ought to be classed as downright abuse with CPS getting involved. A CPS worker would step in and help the child develop independence and- oh, wait, the Boomer government will never fund that because the children can just pull themselves up by their bootstraps apparently lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Dear fellow gen Z let's crash everything and go our own way
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a millennial and all of this resonates with me it's not just a Gen z thing. My parents are boomers who are helicopter parents and literally I am in my mid-30s and I already still feel this way so I can only imagine how Gen z feels but it's literally the same feeling
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this is literally me i can not make a decision i might regret later
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm gen Z (24 yo) but my parents never set up playdates for me. I just went outside to play with my sister and friends living in the same neighbourhood. I could also go to the park on foot or on my bicycle alone or with my friends or sister. This was pretty normal for all the kids my age.    I thought playdates and extreme supervision were more of a Gen Alpha thing?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 26, managed to get into uni before the exams became too challenging, but still graduated into the shittiest job marker with me being rejected or straight ignored over and over again, despite having matching skills and  education for the jobs' requirements. How the f am I suppossed to "grow up" and "settle" with my only sustenance being occasional gigs on the shitjob warehouse and help from my relatives not to die from starvation?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I recently landed on the tiktok of a girl who was getting scrutiny for being unemployed. She clapped back with full receipts. She has candidated for over 2,000, yes, TWO THOUSAND, positions since the beginning of the year. She got to final interviews with 7 employers and didn't get the job with any of them. She holds a degree and has 7 years of professional experience in the field she was applying for. And this is in no way an isolated incident. I am lucky enough to be in one of the most desirable fields nowadays, top of my class, years of experience, and I still had to go to over 20 interviews before I landed my current position. Could you please point out a time in history where it was this difficult to get a job as a qualified person?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: talks about Gen z owning nothing promotes a subscription woman moment
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think you are forgetting a massive portion of gen Z. I'm gen Z and 27 years old, very much not a teenager and not the oldest member of gen z. Mobile phones and the internet only came into play as I entered highschool. We all played outside and hung at shopping centres without helicopter parents. We were all (mostly) succeeding at being adults before covid.   Either this story is more about gen alpha who are already entering the workforce or you've completely missed the state of the economy. The main reasons gen z is struggling to adult is because of mass layoffs, companies avoiding hiring anyone who requires training/ doesn't have years of experience, our degrees becoming useless either midway through or as we graduate because of AI, the reality that we most likely will never be able to afford a home/ raise children and the fact that our governments couldn't care less about their policies worsening climate change and hence destroying our futures.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a parent I found this extremely informative.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's amazing how on point this video is for me. At 15 I find myself stressing constantly about what to do on both a large and small scale. I was talking to my therapist about how I am entirely aware of how this experience is so widely understood but it still manages to feel like I am alone in my struggle. This video has given me a lot of insight, thank you.  Having watched a few of your videos, this one is what pushed me to subscribe ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You can do anything but not everything.  Fear of missing out on opportunities is a real thing but focusing on your path and making your own opportunities along the way is so rewarding.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You can't build a house on no foundation. You don't commit to things financielly if you are not stable financilly... come on!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My therapist said in the first session that her job was to do herself out of a job. She did brilliantly and we had a check-in (after a few sessions) and rough end date (also reviewed closer to the time) in mind. It was a life-changing experience but its focus was to set me up for the REST of my life rather than becoming part of it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I love your videos, but this one seems quite disingenuous and pointless if you don't centre the severe cost of living crisis and the climate. It's like making a video about why your living room is so wet without mentioning that you don't have a roof.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you so much for this video. I've been feeling horrible the last few weeks and this video got me out of that slump. I hope you know how much that means to me! Thank you for your hard work!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im 20 and dont know how to figure out what I'd enjoy for work. Im scared to take care of college debt because everything is already expensive, i want to go backpacking, but it costs so much. How do you choose happiness vs debt
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I love the line that you closed with me that I wish you a week of taking chances because I am a 37-year-old mother with two young kids who just finished applying and enrolling for college today so just know it’s never too late to chase your dreams.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "The Gen Z Crisis" but it's actually just "The Global Economic Crisis" once again... What's up with millennials constantly bashing our generation?? Especially when it comes to things that are- and always have been- out of our control? "Gen Z has no drive," yet I'm close to graduating with my second degree, looking into getting my Master's, running a small business, working part-time, and still manage to have some semblance of a social life after all of that. I have a car, but I don't really drive anywhere because I'm saving my money for things I need or investing in the hopes that someday, I'll be able to own a home. I'm working my ass off in an attempt to guarantee my future success and can't help but feel demoralized by EVERYONE in older generations that has had the same books, articles, etc. written about them when they were our age. It's ridiculous that older generations are falling into the same behavioral pattern of using a younger generation as a buzz word, as a scapegoat, as a red herring to legitimate problems of our society/governments/world. They tell us that we need to grow up when, in reality, we've been more grounded in reality since we were teenagers than many of them were when they graduated college. We've had reality shoved down our throats via the Internet throughout our developmental years and continue to watch the world burn along with whatever was in our savings that we could barely scrounge after paying seemingly insurmountable bills and general cost of living. Fuck...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is the stage in your life when Gen Alpha appear and make fun of your hair and jeans on TikTok to show you how young and cool they are.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is my younger half brother to a T. Him and I have a 6 year age gap and growing up, I already found that my dad was cushioning him too much, figuratively holding his hand through everything, and forcing everyone in my brother’s life to adjust to him. He is 21 now, didn’t finish high school (which I really don’t judge others for but classic my brother), he has never held a job for longer than a few months, no prospects of moving out anytime soon, lays around in bed as soon as he gets home and has zero sense of responsibility or even much capacity to empathize with others. I love the guy but I do not know when he will finally grow up and be responsible.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: All thanks to the baby boomers calling us and saying we need to became adults, while they put more and more garbage and hardship in our lives
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also on the same note us millennials in our 20s felt this way which is why the term adulting was formed
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: YMMV due to environmental factors like neighbors, siblings and what access you have to spaces for children to interact. We're considered on the older side of gen Z but I witnessed a spectrum of friends growing up who had extreme helicopter parents or negligent ignorant parents, both having their repercussions.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Huh? You lost me at Gen Alpha is already entering the workforce. The eldest Gen Alpha isn't even of working age lol😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Thechosen1000  gen alpha is between 2010 and 2025. 13-15 year olds can work in most countries...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh girl trust me everyone feels like that at 15. Life suuuucks at 15. Could not pay me to be 15 again, life as an adult is so much better even with some of the added stressors like bills and stuff.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Precisely couldn’t have summed this up better myself
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel on the contrary that those are just two different topics! Both are important but there’s only so much I can fit into one 30 minute video 😄
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @AshleyEmbers fair enough! I definitely think you made some good points with regards to changes in parenting styles, but I think gen Zs future prospects compared to our parents' generation's is so bleak that it has to be named as a key driver
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @AshleyEmbers then maybe the video shouldn’t be 30 minutes! or at least acknowledge the fact (in video) that you aren’t even scratching the surface of the problem. these aren’t separate issues
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 41 here you don’t get to really choose unless you are born rich or grind hard . Most ppl pick survival 😐
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m older Gen Z, and you just have to try different jobs. I worked like 5 different crappy entry level jobs in my earlier 20s before I figured out I enjoy teaching. There’s no way to figure out what you like unless you try.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: n its a shame too that millennials of all ppl are the ones bashing us the most, when they themselves should know what its like to be constantly scrutinized, ridiculed n frankly never enough.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm glad I'm not the only one living an existential crisis since I was 16
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: All of this kind of content is so boring now.   Please. The economy sucks and genz don't have money to build a future. That's it. We don't need a 40 min breakdown as if its some mysterious phenomenon. Like.. everything else is just a symptom of the economic situation.  Why commit to a slave-like existence that for most people will be much more effort than it's worth.  Its just comes back to: treat someone like a child and they'll act like one. If you can't afford to grow up (have a house/car/family) why try to? Might as well vibe until things get easier.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bit of trauma dumping here, but I’m living this at the moment, and I figure some people can relate. I turn 21 soon, and I feel like I have absolutely nothing going for me. I don’t work or go to school because I’m on disability (that’s a load of trauma in itself), but I live with my parents because that’s nowhere near enough income to get my own place.   That aside, I grew up having to be an adult immediately. On top of severe health issues, my father is extremely abusive and violent, and I have lived with him since I was born, including now. My brother and sister got out of the house early, military and college. But I’m stuck. I spent my entire childhood and teenage years in survival mode, and now that things are comparatively peaceful bc I have a car and can escape when things get dangerous, I feel so guilty for enjoying my free time. For not taking those risks, because I spent every year of my teenage years doing that. I want to stop feeling like hardship and suffering is a necessary part of being a productive and valuable human being.   I guess my overall point here is trauma stunts brain development. It can be a contributing factor in the idea of “Peter Pan syndrome”, but is a result of the opposite of coddling. It’s growing up never being able to rest, constantly forced to be resilient for the sake of survival, never-ending risk taking and impulsivity to cope, and simultaneously never being able to focus on the things that really matter to being a healthy adult when you get there.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey, you really can't discuss all of this without starting from the economy and employers' job expectations, and I'm saying this as a young Millennial. I know it probably gets more difficult to understand poverty, and a poor future outlook can make you unwilling to do anything once you're a successful content creator, but Gen Z is becoming adults in a terrible world.   Let's just be honest. Since they were kids, they could witness all the gruesomeness and cruelty of humans globally thanks to the internet; and it's only become worse after the pandemic: the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Israeli genocide on Gaza being denied by the most poweful countries, a mysoginist being elected as the president of the USA, the rise of right-wing leaders, the anti-tourism and anti-immigration sentiment. Everything is anti and negative.   Add generative AI into the mix, and Gen Z knows that they're about to start their careers, yet they will likely be wiped out by AI in a few years. Everything is negative and hopeless if you're being objective. Oh, and I forgot the climate change.  I empathize with Gen Z and understand their struggle. They need our support, and if nothing else, understanding.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i moved into a dorm at 14. chose architecture oriented highschool, decided i'd go into civil engineering in college. i was always very independent and a "mini-adult", as my parents and thei friends would call me, because i was severely neglected all my childhood. moving out at such a young age only made me more independent. it really, really helped with the whole "i don't wanna grow up" thing because i do want to grow up and i do want to be completely on my own and i WANT a normal person job and a normal person life
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sooo it IS a parenting issue 😂 Parents, let your kids think for themselves!! My mom did it for me and I can't thank her enough. My dad was always there to help me, but it was my mom that had me think for myself. Even with our baby, he is 11 months but is learning everyday. He already knows that he can whine to get my husband to help him move his walker or get a toy instead of doing it himself. When he sees me, he gets his own walker unstuck right away and is now a little monkey by picking up all kinds of stuff with his feet lol.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Being an elder gen z who did not grow up like this, I feel pretty thankful. Meeting young gen z has been an eye opener
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 26:53 I kind of feel this video is incredibly tone deaf. Therapy for many helps us to not push all of our issues onto others. All of us are surrounded by awful things every single day. We’re not afraid to grow up, we economically can’t. I wasn’t coddled during life, which means I don’t have money as an adult to pay for thousands of dollars in rent, insurance, other bills, etc. jobs don’t pay well, the job market is trash, and I have two degrees. I wish we’d stop somewhat blaming every new generation when the previous contributed massively to the issues before us today.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think that the pandemic also played a huge part because many teenage milestones for people like me who are now in their early 20s just never happened and while I like my life as it is right now, I feel like I'm still stuck on some things that I feel like should have happened in my teenage years but never did. I turned 18 in 2020 with a TINY celebration and graduated the German equivalent of high school in 2021 and our graduation celebration was a ceremony outside that ended with a rainstorm with most of the teachers leaving without saying goodbye and us taking our pictures in really weird locations... It really sucked to be honest...  In addition to this, I think I was a very "adult" child, I was very ambitious and serious and good at most things and I just got tired... I'm turning 23 soon and I will hopefully get my bachelor's degree next year but it took me a while to get there, I just had to do a lot of reorienting myself because being an adult is confusing lol. Altogether I'm holding up quite well but The Anxiety... Oh boy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 17:50 False!! There is less crime & CA than ever. This is a fact. The 24 hour news cycle and increase of reporting of minor issues thanks to fearmongering (ie; moms are jailed for letting their kids walk to the store alone these days!) account for this common misconception.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm and elder Gen Z 27, but man, there are two camps. The ultra-high achievers, the have the most fun, achieve the most, own the most, do the most crowd which are frankly pretty exhausting. And then never do anything, no ambition, complete disassociation, addicted to gaming, or X. There's really no such thing as a healthy well balanced person. Just two extremes and these are reactions to the economic circumstances, you've got this who go ballistic trying to keep up or our achieve their parents, and you've got those who've decided to pack it in. As with everything, it always comes back to the money,
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I didn't get to have most of the formative experiences you're "supposed" to have in teenagehood, because I was depressed and anxious out of my mind and couldn't even go to school. I'm really feeling the effects of that as an adult now. But the most healing thing for me has been learning that I was never the problem; the system is. The society we live in (I only speak to my experience in the U.S.) is not designed for us to thrive in any sense. Especially if you aren't white, straight, cis, thin, neurotypical, and not disabled. The suffering of Gen z and frankly every generation right now is systemic. Yes, these issues have been around for a long long time, but we're more aware of them than ever, and people feel more powerless than ever. The system will take a lot of hard work and time to change, and it's okay to hurt in the meantime. Things suck. Your anxiety is valid.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fr. As a gen z who had to take care of my immigrant family from the youngest age and had no comfort of "smn doing smth for me" I am in shock meeting people my age who are scared to drive a car, scared to make an appointment, they're scared to start apprenticeship, they're scared to go to a bank. And they'll tell me "you don't get it" bro I was also scared I was terrified but my parents were not sheltering me and I knew I had to learn if I wanted to get by. Most of these people have parents who just allow this type of behavior and its so annoying
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Boomers aren't hiring Millenials, and aren't hiring GenZ... now Boomers, and even GenX, is dying and they're wondering why they have no work force. 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: But then there’s me who’s 19 that doesn’t have their drivers license solely because she is absolutely terrified because her drivers ed teacher taught her “based off fear because driving with fear is the best way to drive”. This is coming from an ex state trooper who would show us multiple stories from our city of kids getting ran over, highschool kids getting in crashes and dying and their backstories, just a lot of messed up stuff. But everyone around her just kinda sums it up to “she’s scared and doesn’t want to take that responsibility”, I hate it

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 35:30 watched Peter Pan? You're a millennial. What about hook? He loses the ability to fly from leaving Neverland. And regains from engaging his children 😊
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don’t understand I’m 23 half my friends are married with kids already half live in apartments or with their parents, none of us are happy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is also what I'm going through. It's like social media is a catalogue of different "life designs" and it's hard to choose. Meanwhile, time keeps passing by
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Totally. I don’t remember how I said it in the video but what I meant was that there’s increased news on these things so it’s in our face so much.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: But crime is still happening. My daughter was abducted and SA by a stranger less than a mile from our home. It wasn't broadcast all over the news or anything. Thankfully she was able to escape. But the predator was on $0 bail for SA a few months prior. Its still happening they are just not showcasing it.   You never think it will be your family in that situation until it is. He took a plea for 14 years in Jan 2025.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 21 I have saved 66% of every paycheck I have received to buy a house  I can't afford to get a mortgage between home insurance water rates Internet water gas and food ontop of mortgage payments I would not be able to afford anything  No dating + no going out = even more alone  No car No vacation  No money set aside for a rainy day   I'm sure I'm not the only one to be priced out of the opatunity to take that next step in life and be that much more independent  I have saved for just under 3 years It feels as though I won't be able to move forward for a decade even with my family supporting me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It seems like a lot of people are focusing on the economic state of today as reasonings for not “adulting”. While I understand that, I think the point of the video and all the research that went into it is showing a lot of the social differences in our generation and how we grew up as opposed to past generations, and how this has impacted the generation as a whole. It is very common for me to see, and I have felt this influence myself, that we can tend to avoid wanting to be adults or take on responsibilities, and I have certainly felt this influence from society, upbringings, social media, etc. While it may be difficult to buy a house and afford rent right now (I feel that for sure), we are not the first generation to struggle financially, yet we are responding in a different way based on how society has changed. I liked the video and thought it important to acknowledge how I interpreted the message to be.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 23 with a masters degree and just feel awful 😢
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: maybe growing up with social is a bad thing....who would have thought.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Literally what’s the point. Humans have taken everything good about life and put it behind a paywall. I’m good man. I don’t want to participate in this convoluted unfair society and I honestly kind of resent my parents for bringing me into the world knowing this is how the world is like. Suffering is the ONLY thing guaranteed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You know this may just be my personal perspective bia. But I was f**** tortured as a kid. I was forced to grow up fast and I sure haven't gotten a house, kids, a vacation, or a plan. To me it feels like the life previous generations had is gone. It leaves me bitter.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: From the age of 5 for the next 12 years for 9 hours a day we have every decision made for us in this place called school. Then we’re dropped off at 16/17 and told figure it out. We never developed decision making skills.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: young people when they're young and act accordingly  time is a flat circle
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 3:42 why would a teenager be motivated to have a vehicle to go out if going anywhere for fun is a money hole
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gosh, I wish people would stop simplifying the nervous system and talking about it like it's so straightforward. For example, all this talk of "dopamine hits" or "in your teens the prefrontal cortex is developing so you're like this and this." Please just stop. I love your videos otherwise, and you're hardly the only one doing this, I keep hearing over and over there hugely oversimplified things about the nervous system and medicine in general on so many videos.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I wonder why younger people aren’t able to live their lives the way their parents and grandparents did? Could it be because the economy is fucked, fascism has taken over the entire world, there’s multiple genocides going on, the internet is flooded with AI slop and time wasting corporate bullshit, capitalism is fucking everyone and everything over, and we’re all about to die in a climate apocalypse..? Just a thought
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video was all lies. Parents neglect, abuse and abandon their children. My parents ignored me and kicked me out on the street at 16. This video is lies. I was not "safely living under my parents roof"   The real reason is because young people have no roof to "safely" live.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a Gen Z with a Bachelor's degree and management/admin/customer service experience. I've been severely underpaid my entire life. I'm attending interviews right now for companies that pay decently and treat you well. It's been hard being told "wow your resume looks great" or, "your experience is amazing!" and then being ghosted even despite following up consistently... The job market sucks, my partner and I have to be double income to afford a rental property, expensive groceries and even more expensively, car payments! We have had to grow up so fast and make big decisions that will impact our lives financially and mentally. At this point, all we want to do is live comfortably enough to get by each week.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m not a fan that you’re making this whole video about helicopter parents.   You don’t seem to address the macroeconomic context for these roles. Early career roles do not pay for an independent lifestyle.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as a teenager myself, i believe this is (or at least in my specific case) due to things and places getting more and more unsafe for everyone right now. going outside has become a dreadful experience for people under 18, in general. im 16 and live in LATAM, i have experienced being catcalled on the streets while in my school uniform, almost gotten hit by a car, and almost getting abducted among other things.   there was even one situation there i was out at night with my father in his car and we stopped by a chicharron stand, the guy said that our children would be beautiful and my father told him i was his child. i was 13 at the time and couldn't comprehend how this guy could just say that, nor why it was normal for him to see older men just going out with their really young girlfriends and buying food from him.   these experiences are exacly why i avoid going out in general, i am trying to get a licence but i am definetly not looking forward to driving in these conditions.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Because parents need to take all social media away until your kids turn 18. There’s a proper age to find out how bad the world really is, and is definitely not when they’re kids. Now all these young adults are depressed without purpose.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 11:20 i feel like thats bc when parents have a lot of children, the burden to take care of, watch after, and raise them falls to the older siblings. So maybe thats why parents "dont gave to worry" bc they already have their older kids looking after the younger ones.  The older children dont have as much "time" to think about what they want bc theyre worried about the younger children.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This term adulting is so gross and patronizing. Show yourself some self respect. It is not "aDuLTiNg", you are literally just doing the things we need to do to survive, and you are infantalizing yourself subtly everytime you embrace this stupid mindset
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've learnt a lot in this video! Both as a Gen Z navigating adulthood and as a therapy user. Thanks for the insights :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: These are signs of narcissism. Social media has contributed to the increasing narcissism of our society. Everbody wants to be something special and have extraordinary life experiences.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yea you’re definitely glossing over the elephant in the room, our buying power is just not what it used to be. i was born in 2002, i literally make 3 times minimum wage and cannot afford to live without roommates. if i could own instead of rent i would in a heartbeat. a few months ago i finally finished paying off the car i had to start financing at 18, after the old hand me down car blew up on me mere months after graduating high school. for the first time in my adult life i do not have a car payment, and i STILL can’t save as much as i’d like to because the price of things like gas, food, and utilities keeps rising. even after being freed from a huge monthly expense, im still not much better off than i was before. the worst part is that i consider myself lucky for having a car handed down to me in high school, even if it didn’t survive to my adulthood in the first place, some of my peers didn’t even have that luxury.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes! That’s exactly it. Gen z has been dealt a shit hand economically but this video was on a different side of the conversation. I totally understand everyone sharing their piece on how the cost of living and job market are preventing them from making progress though. It’s great to hear all the different perspectives 😄
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There are many other  factors other than social media. Y'all will literally blame social media for everything 💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How is taking social media away supposed to help lower the cost of living?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Specklewingit won’t, but it would help them regulate their mental health, and prepare better for the future ahead.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sadly it's kind of necessary to be able to pitch a personal unique selling point, as the entry level has been getting offshored and automated away.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The enshittification of everything happened after the crash of 08, but really picked up steam after 2020. For example in my country, lets say you wanted to get a drivers license back in the 80s/90s. The requirements, time and cost were about 1/5th of today, now making it a massive hassle that young people just barely can afford - nvm actually getting the car and paying for all the added tolls, insurances, fees, repair costs they make up on a daily.  This is ONE area. Now do the same with housing, job market, education, dating, food costs - everything is a COMPLETE mess. Oh, and they are flooding every western country with brownoids and blacks to compete with you on every level - housing spots, employment (.gov often pays a large % of the salary to give them a leg up), education spots, kindergarten spots, social security, healthcare.  Gen Z are being squeezed from every single imaginable direction - no fkn wonder they are done.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s nothing to do with “generations” this is just made up to give the poor people something to argue about. No one’s happy because we live in a late stage capitalist system. It’s pretty obvious that basing your entire life around money is a recipe for despair

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Maybe, just a thought, our indecision is a PTSD symptom. Our whole lives have been one major traumatic event after another that has threatened our livelihood. In addition to us not having any clear guidance anymore. College costs almost as much as a house, houses are being bought up by private businesses who are raising property prices to be even more than they already were. We are being paid pennies when we finally do find a job. We cannot afford to have children; therefore what is the point and purpose of getting married? Did I miss anything? Give us grace we are trying.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Applied for 50 jobs in a month. Heard from four, two were automated responses. Got rejected from fast food places and grocery stores. Got interviews from two apps, one was a scam. The other one I got is barely giving me enough hours, but I have to stick with it cause there’s nothing else so far. I also have 8 years in customer service with commendations even, and these were all very “basic” (using the word loosely) jobs I was applying to :(

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The reason why we don't seem to find a direction is the fact that everywhere we turn and try to go, there's a wall. want to pursue a career? not unless you have 10 years experience, a phd, plenty of contacts and nepotism. want to live with a simple, humble job?  start with 5 years of experience in the financial sector to get this job stacking cans of beans, and even if we hire you have fun starving because minimum wage can't even afford you food. want to pursue a creative endeavor? good luck getting so good that you don't fear getting substituted by ai. want to be an entrepeneur? sell your soul and become part of the problem because everything costs too much, that is, if you have the luck of actually making it and you don't waste all your money into a failing company. want to just stay in your parents' house and rot until the economy fixes itself? have fun getting insulted by your parents and society for "being lazy", feeling useless, and putting your life on pause for an indefinite amount of time that could last your entire lifetime :D.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Having something that I genuinely enjoy, that being Videography & Filmmaking, is probably the only thing keeping me going and motivated in terms of career. I've been hustling my own business for the past 2 years and slowly but surely it's paying off. What is absolutely crazy to me, is that it is easier for me to hustle my own business than it is to work as a cleaner, barista, retail worker or waiter.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: being early gen Z about to turn 27 watching this like oh you ment young gen Z not all gen Z.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That’s me at 0:22 , I think it’s important to mention that Gen Z is under so much more pressure because of the exposure we have on social media.   We aren’t lazy, we are just the first generation to leave uni and be equipped with so much transparency to what the real world has in store that we’re unsure whether we want to commit to a life that inevitably traps you into a life of mediocrity.   It’s not fear to try things, it’s fear that we will end up like everyone we see on social media. Trapped, anxious, under the control of large of corporates.  I’m 26 so I’m on the edge of gen z and took the traditional path of corporate, I’ve built everything I have on my own and learnt to grow from every failure in my life. I’m more aware than most that a traditional career leads to an average life and yet I’m still working one (currently in the process of changing that). So I know from first hand experience why most other gen z’s just leaving school or uni are so hesitant to “become adults.” They compare this image of financially free 20 year olds driving lambos to a 30+ year old stuck in the corporate chain. It’s pretty obvious why we hesitate. (This is what my video was actually about)  The world just hasn’t caught up to this new era of business and careers to allow gen z to truly thrive. We are the first generation (not all of us) to reject the traditional trap of careers and are searching for the next new thing. Which sadly, isn’t quite matured enough for the mass market.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @extoriq353  If by "better competition" you mean society currently firing on all cylinders to keep you and your familiy employed, fed, clothed, out of jail, in school - as well as gaslight the population 24/7 that you aren't a problem in exactly every single town, city, country on earth then I fully agree.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Growing up felt like avoiding bears in the woods, I wanted to be unseen and unheard. My parents demanded good grades, but I couldn’t focus on studying. My face was covered in acne since the age of 9, I was overweight, and I had no interest in sports. I was ridiculed every day by both adults and children.  It took me until the age of 27 to start turning my luck around, but then COVID happened. Now, at 31, the only thing I have going for me is my work. I have no money to get my own place, I've never experienced love, and my biological clock is ticking.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 35 and I didn’t know what I wanted to do so I dated rich men for a living then married one. Now I just shop.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So much of this anguish and anxiety could be alleviated by just getting off social media and not living on a device. I hope this for Gen Z, and for Gen alpha. Y'all didn't ask to be born into this phone-centered time, and it's a huge hurdle you must learn to deal with

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 12 minutes into the video, and as a genzer who is having a healthy and motivated transition to adulthood, I feel like you're right. As someone involved in education it makes me livid that parents won't challenge their children or teach them life skills. I'm going to try and keep watching but I don't know how much I can because it's so damn infuriating when my peers haven't been raised to be adults. It's creating new cycles that will be so damaging in the long run. You're supposed to teach your kids your phone number, warn them of red flags and then let them go play.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ....I hadn't considered that my struggles with going out (like socially) tied back to how I was kept in the house and maybe the backyard sometimes (when my grandma felt up to watching me) for my entire childhood.  We were rural though, do there wasn't a neighborhood to walk around in. And there were a lot of dangerous semi trucks that drove on the road by our house with no sidewalks, so it absolutely wasnt safe to just walk or bike along the edge of the road either. My family tried to give us responsibility and we absolutely were allowed to be bored and problem solve for ourselves, but even then I just struggle so much with socializing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Here is the thing. Making decisions is more difficult than ever because of the multiple possibilities our increasingly connected world offers but the thing that make those decisions actually difficult is that even if I figure out that I have to take action and experiment to figure out my direction and settle on something, you still have to do the thing which in our world it’s an increasingly difficult thing to do that leads to burn out and losing all hopes…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ve noticed this myself, especially when it comes to “hovering parents”. when I was a pre-teen my mom encouraged me to volunteer and helped me find opportunities that were interesting to me and what I maybe wanted to do as an adult, but it was my responsibility to fill out the application, set up the interview, reach out via email, etc… now I’ve worked places where we have volunteers and their parents will come get the forms without the kid even knowing and then the parent is the one constantly calling and emailing to checkup on the application. Then if those kids do get the opportunity to volunteer the parents will call and tell us the kid is sick or that they have a vacation coming up…. And a lot of times those kids don’t even really seem interested in the volunteer opportunity.   I also had teachers that encouraged me to do hard things, there were many times I told one of my teachers “I can’t” or “I’m not ready” but he knew I could do it and even if I failed or got embarrassed he kept encouraging me to keep trying. I don’t know where I would be if I didn’t have these opportunities to try and fail and take responsibility for the things I chose to do.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Man I can’t even find a job right now. How am I supposed to figure out what I want to do, let alone move forward with my life when I can’t even get a part time retail job
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I didn't care about driving and probably wouldn't have learned until it was a priority if it weren't for my parents basically just signing me up for the class.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: See, the problem is that most adults don't understand that there's a middle ground between "helicopter coddling" and just beating your kid
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Aside from all this,  gen z has Ashley Embers to lead them 😊
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I will say on the topic of therapy, as I work in mental health, the reason it doesn’t always work or sometimes do more harm than good is because the main type of therapy we talk about and utilize is CBT aka “talk therapy”. As a society, we do not explore therapy like DBT, IFS, EMDR, CPT, and more as much as we could. For me, CBT only worked at a teen and doesn’t really help as an adult. However, DBT has been very beneficial for me and the way I think through my anxiety in the moment. It also teaches me tools such as direct communication (when it’s appropriate as well) and mindfulness. There’s also places like anxiety outpatient programs that can teach one to expose themselves to their fears in a safe way so when it comes up in day to day life, it doesn’t cause that same level of anxiety if any. I know people who went through outpatients like those and came out being way more resilient and able to face normally anxious situations head on as well as allow themselves to fail.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Idk, I'm gen z and I'm like this too, even though I wasn't coddled or caged in during childhood. I think it's generally harder nowadays to move on from your childhood because finding an apartment is harder, dating is harder, meeting people is harder.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: thought life sucked growing up in a strict military family but now as an adult im grateful my family were all vicious. high expectations and barely did any handholding not too mention VERY quick to discipline😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as someone in their early 20's, i may be childish, but i've felt 30 since i was 6
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I would argue if your therapist isn't helping you move on and building a resilience and letting go of the past then the therapist isn't really a good therapist while the therapist often lets you make the pace they normally also should push you forward and let you know that it will be over at some point
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 32:43 damn its real nice to be offline when it's like this

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 33:33 Was the most relatable point from the video
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've realized as a gen z man (25) the only thing I can truly control is myself. I may be dealt with some crappy situations but I will never give up on myself. everyday I will show up as my best self and continue to embrace my journey of life and do what keeps me on the right track physically, mentally, emotionally, etc. idgaf about what happens tbh I just care about staying on top of my yanno what as a person. straight discipline and unshakable faith. whatever happens in reality to me ill take it to the chin and keep pushing. yes we aint got it like previous gens but we must keep striving as individuals. when death comes we will be asking ourselves more about how did we live than what did we achieve. stay solid soldiers.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it isn’t that we don’t WANT to do these things lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly I agree, while I don’t yet know what I wanna be (am just 13 though so I know I still have time) I cannot wait to make my own money, move out and be independent. What I’ve also noticed is that whenever me or my siblings plan on doing sth that’ll be uncomfortable for us, my mom will often argue with us and will try stopping us which causes a rift between us cuz well, I wanna do that and mom’s turning this into a full on screaming match simply because I want to carry my book around to read (actually happened). What I think is truly problematic though is that usually she’ll let us have it our way in the end while being clearly mad about it and making us (at least me, I can’t speak for my siblings) feel bad about it, just to carry the book around for me in the end and not letting me feel the consequences of my actions (so basically she’ll argue about it, give in while being passive aggressive about it and  we don’t even realise that it’s a bad thing to do cuz she takes the hit in the end while we’re able to walk carefree)  My dad on the other hand puts too much pressure on us. He calls me and my older brother “almost adults” at the age of 13 & 15, gives us chores (my chores for example are cleaning the bathrooms, sinks and vacuuming the general areas) and while he does pay us for it, he also puts a lot of pressure on us with those chores. It has come to a point were I’m dreading his weekends (they’re divorced) simply because I know that I’ll have to clean under his supervision and at the end I get to listen to what I forgot to do and/or get a new thing added to the list of things that I have to clean.  I love both of my parents and I’m grateful for many things that they’ve done for me. But for fucks sake, I can’t wait to be able to tell them “kindly fuck off, this is my life/my home/ my kids”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just never had any goals cause existing feels uncomfortable and annoying and still didn't accept tye fact that I'm real and also the world is falling apart

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Because they think life is a TikTok video and they will live a life of comfort without going through the hardship, trials, tribulation, and fears of life.  For the vast majority of people, there isn't some light that comes on and suddenly a clear path is set.  It's about working and failing and getting up and adjusting and working and failing until one day, you settle into something that carries you through.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ugh 😑 I’m sick of hearing that the people of my generation are being coddled or have no drive to succeed in life. Anyone trying to survive in this economy should have the sense to realize it’s not that easy or simple. I’m an older part of Gen Z at 27 years old and honestly consider myself more of a “Zillennial”. I didn’t get my license till I was 24 years old and that only because I had the help of my bf, now husband, to teach me how to drive. The reason that so many in Gen Z haven’t gotten their driver’s licenses isn’t because they don’t have “the drive” to get one. It’s due to multiple factors stacked against them. Has anyone in the older generations considered the fact that many schools have removed driver’s ed classes from their high school programs or that both parents usually work full time jobs and hardly have time to help teach their kids how to drive so there isn’t anyone to teach them unless they pay a lot to get lessons? What about how the cost of getting a car (even a junk car) is crazy expensive let alone insurance, maintenance, and gas costs and that fact that it’s so difficult to just get a job to hopefully cover the costs of getting a car but also the fact that you wouldn’t make nearly enough if you did get the job to even purchase a working car? Stop blaming people who had no hand in creating the current world situation they now are forced to survive in. The people who actually have the power to change things and make life more affordable and thus attainable need to step up if they want the future to be bright.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i’m 26. i would love to start having kids in my early 30’s. i have yet to find someone in their mid-late 20’s who has even DECIDED whether or not they want kids yet. most are avoiding even thinking about it. i want children too much to wait on someone else to make up their mind, and i don’t want to wait until i’m 40 which seems like the age current adults are “ready” these days.

Your grocery bill isn't supposed to cost 300 to 400 dollars that's what rent used to be 4 years ago give or take... I also believe that basic necessities for life and survival should be completely free as you'd perish without...

I save up my earnings to buy my own stuff but it's still not enough to sustain myself.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm Gen Z (26). Started but didn’t finish college for a STEM  career to work 3 jobs, move out of a hostile environment at 20, got a work injury ( and didnt get WC), moved to office work and now I have a fufilling job and looking at a leadership position.  In the past decade, I've gone through 10 jobs.  I've been discriminated, backstabbed, laid off, did jobs outside my position, and worked many unpaid hours. It's all experience. It's all survival. And it all took time.  I don't think Gen Z was lied to. The truth just evolved. Cus college DID get you jobs. During the 70s-90s. Even if it feels like life has stopped for us, the world keeps moving. I have no idea what I'm im doing, no sense of direction with my life and with ai, constantly scared of losing my job, but we need to adapt and move forward. Or else we'll just be stuck.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm gen z, and a younger one at that. But what that guy in your vid said about finding what you are good at before you decide on what you wanna do is so true.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think it is very much related to kids never learning to take care of themselves and their things. It is very important for parents to let the kids figure out things and solutions on their own: do the laundry to have clean clothes to wear, figuring out what to eat, clean up after making the food you just ate, keeping up with learning school stuff, having leasures, taking care of your health/body, etc. It is a full time job for years and years. If the parent hire weekly help to clean up the house, have a laundry service and get food delivered with pre-planned recepies, the kids will never know what to do nor how to take care of themselves and they won’t figure out what they need in order to even survive. Much like what is explained at 10:45.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It would be interested to compare Gen Z from healthy family dynamics to Gen Z from toxic or outright abusive relationships. The latter kinda forces them to grow up quicker and if they have the means to escape, they will.

Now they are holding my transcripts, and I can not get educated anywhere until I pay back a ridiculous amount of money (they illegally penalized me with). Aside from this, because of one severe disability I am told by doctors to take breaks from school and work. I also cant drive because of this disability so a lot of opportunities are missed. So yeah. Independence is hard for me. I will have to rely heavily on my parents for now and my boyfriend once we're married. I probably won't be able to finish school for a longggg time. I felt shamed and excluded from this conversation. When you stigmatize living with your parents and taking longer to hit milestones you pile shame on neurodivergence, health issues, and disabilities. ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So... I don't believe I was coddled like that, even though I know I was coddled. As a Gen Z, my parents had stake in my future but still didn't do any of the work and left that for me, which I have mixed feelings about, but made me build the skills I needed for real life. Not all of them tho. I still feel that anxiety of someone watching over me but not in a good way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We don't have helicopter parents anymore, we have helicopter facilitators.   If the goal of "be a good parent" eclipses everything else, our kids end up treating us like staff. There's an element of being overly-supervised and/or spoiled, but it's also the death of parenting on an emotional level. Why would I talk to my chauffeur about my path in life? His job is just to drive me wherever I want to go. Kids learn by example, and if the only goal they see you set is "I hope my child is happy," they're going to be preoccupied with their happiness (or lack thereof) and unable to set any other goals.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: MH awareness isn't always good!  When I studied science, fellow students struggled, but we mostly got through it & improved through our failures.  In my psych degree, fellow students started to see every pathology within themselves! Each term, the cohort would start out ok, then recognise some symptoms of what we studied... So of course we had that disorder!  MH among the psych students was so much worse than the science students.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is gana sound silly,  but as I was listening to this my 9 year old loaded and started a load of laundry by himself for the first time without any help, and then without prompting asked if I could take a picture so he could remember this moment 😂 he's so proud of himself❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think you did a great job addressing many of the issues that could potentially be causing Gen Z to struggle such as certain parenting situations or not having enough experience building independence. However, from my personal experience as a younger Gen Z student, coming from a low income situation, I found those same points to be discouraging. I strive against all obstacles to be independent and “grow up” but those aspirations are very difficult to achieve without parental support or financial aid. I appreciate you taking the time to curate these different factors and I believe it was in good taste, but I am unsure about how Gen Z like myself is meant to move forward even if we have all the motivation in the world.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I blame social media  And I’m a  Gen Z
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just turned 30, and only in the last two years have we: gotten married, bought a house, and now are having kids. We lived in a bedroom of my mother in laws house for years before that. We had/have good jobs (I was unemployed for a stretch in there) but still needed to save up. Now I’m going to be a stay at home mom and started my own business.   But I also made like 3 or 4 wrong decisions before that in my 20s. And all of those wrong decisions that held me back have informed and helped shape the good decisions I’m stepping into. It’s amazing how fast things can change and you just need to learn from everything you do. The secret is to make decisions and start now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 30 and still have no idea what I want to do with my life. I used to want to be an artist, but after going to college for it and then not being able to get a job in my field I completely lost my passion for it. I'm too scared to even try to monetize my other hobby (video games) bc I don't want the one thing I still enjoy to become a job that I hate (plus it's an oversaturated market anyways). I'm currently a caregiver for my 93yo grandma and terrified of when I have to return to the workplace bc I don't think I could do this kind of work for strangers.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i'm the oldest of gen z i think? (25 soon!) i've been mentally disabled and chronically ill since birth so i'm probably not a good example of the average person in my generation. however i definitely struggle with a lot of the same issues, not necessarily for the same reasons. i can't work and have dedicated the past two years of my life trying to figure out who i am, who i want to be, and what i want my life to look like. it is my goal to be stable, functional, and self sufficient by the time i am 30. my teen years were wasted away in hospitals or in bed, so i am using my 20's to make mistakes, experiment, and build healthy habits. i don't know what the average neurotypical able bodied gen z personal life looks like in comparison, but from the people my age i have met like that they do not seem much better off in some ways. it is kind of scary when you know that other people can understand things better than you but even they are confused.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The future has been taken from these people. Yeah, they have every right to be hopeless.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No car, no dreams.... I don't want to sound pessimistic but I feel like I have nothing to strive for at all.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a middle child of several siblings and we grew up in a very restrictive household. Every move was dictated. Now that we are all in our twenties, I’m the only one who came out unscathed, a career etc…. Where I should be saving my money, I’m the breadwinner for an entire household and my siblings are in an almost zombie like state of nothingness (they’re all picking and dropping, changing education)  ever since my parents let go of the tight reigns, expecting them to walk on their own.  Imagine your older sibling asking you for snack money 😭 my friends are confused how I’m not angry or trying to leave but it’s ok, it’s love.   I do wish they’d at least get part time jobs 😆
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh hey, my parents are eastern european! No teen job though, my parents wanted us to focus on school and get a degree. Leaving the nest also looks different in eastern europe tho, there isn't an expectation of moving out the moment you reach adulthood. Even when you move out you still help your parents and they still help you, and there's a lot of community connection cuz your parents always know a guy so there's so many opportunities to meet and keep up with people. At least in my case, my city has a big but still manageable slavic community so that identity serves as a built in connection so long as you nurture it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I want to get a job that I enjoy but every time I think about it and what happened to me earlier in the year that was caused by stress I just want a job that I enjoy but also less stressful and I'm not sure if there is a job that would be something that I'll enjoy and won't cause me so much stress that I'll get vertigo and hurt myself again.  If you don't know what vertigo is it's basically everything feels like everything is spinning around you and it messes with your balance.  The hunting myself thing was because I couldn't walk straight when I told mom that I felt dizzy after I did I fell and nocked a chair over at the kitchen table that fell on top of me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So lets see: -Lots of helicopter parents who, though well meaning might coddle their children too much -Education system designed to create obedient workers when, surprise surprise... -No job oppurtunities without degrees, roll the dice a million times and still go through months to years of non-stop demoralizing job hunting even if you do get a degree. -Jobs don't pay a living wage, few oppurtunities for growth in entry level jobs, working hard is not rewarded -Cost of housing food bills (living) unmanageable -Surrounded by miserable adults and miserable people ('grow up kids, it'll be great!') -Technology at your fingertips that will validate whatever you feel, algorithims that incentivize creating echo chambers -Even outside of perception, an increasingly tumultuos miserable world with insane politics, violence without reason, complete climate catastrophy on the horizon, etc -Whatever additional baggage a young person already has  I don't really see why there's any issues. Kids must just be lazy tbh
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 21:49 to be fair, therapy is expensive af if you dont have work benefits
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My Gen Z kids had a ton of independent play but sadly are still slow to launch.  I had to force them to get their driver's license.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i have worked since i was 16 (almost 10 years) entirely in customer service and entry level jobs. i dropped out of college due to the fact that i was working 38 hour weeks on top of school and couldn’t afford to feed myself. now i still live paycheck to paycheck and every company i have worked for has been RIDDLED with bad management and moral/ethical policy that undervalues me and what i offer the company. every manager has disliked me bc i am good at my job but know right from wrong and will not act purely for profit (as if they would compensate for hard work anyways). getting a raise is impossible. companies purposely lie on your reviews so they dont have to pay you your worth. this has been every company i have worked for for the last 10 years. my parents and everyone else lied to me. why would i continue to throw myself at companies that don’t care if i live or die?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I didn't have shit when I was in my early 20s - I studied and got an entry level IT job and 5 years later got a job at a FAANG company.  Gen Z obviously needs to kick it into gear... but they also don't need to have it all figured out yet.  I had a friend who started his IT career at 40! Life isn't a marathon where you can't rest and run all the way to retirement... it's usually a collection of sprints and rests.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And ironically people from school I knew who were devout Christians/conservatives are married, having children, have grown up as adults and are much more fulfilled. Sometimes I wish I could believe in what they believe instead of being a 30 year old loser that has no full time job and just coping with nihilistic thoughts.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am on of the oldest gen z folks, someone who was born in 1998, and I think difficulty getting into the job market and starting a full time career doesn't help this.  I am not American though, so I think in my country in Europe, it might vary a bit compared to Americans, but my Gen X mother was very much a 'helicopter parent' as described here.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The helicopter parent part hit home for me. Millennial and my mom wasnt just a helicopter. She was a heavy lift helicopter parent. Only really screwed me up and made things hard for later in life. Things she did id recommend against. Not letting your kid introduce themselves to anyone even relatives until they are 14. Not allow them outside your sight/yard until 16 or 17 then wonder why they just stay inside and don't want to go anywhere. Have to know every detail about their friend and plans when they are going out until they are 22 and if not told call and call and cause fights and stress. Thus making your kid want to just never meet new friends or do anything because its clearly wrong to as its such a fight always.  Though if you do want your kid to rerely/never talk to you once they can move out its a good choice.  Moving 10+hrs away and barely seeing or talking to parents is best thing i ever did. Only reason didn't totally cut them out was my spouse convincing me not to and just making it limited contact.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Kind of hard to find direction in a life where there is no direction anymore. Everything’s fucking apathetic and stupid.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 21 and have no idea what I'm doing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Was born 2005.   I always saw kids around me feelingthe pressure to act older than they are, I believe I was considered very strange for not doing so, It is true that I never wanted to grow up, In fact for a long time I was legitimately terrified.   Because of the way adults would talk about it, Talk about how constantly miserable they were How stressful their lives are, And almost wearing their misery as a badge of honor..   They acted as if I didn't have a choice in the matter either, So you can imagine my relief when I found out that wasn't true. But at the same time, the "adult" Mindset Is incredibly sneaky and insidious.   So in a way , I still don't want to grow up, And I never truly will, I believe my generation was made to Grow up or mature a lot faster, But at the same time was given less opportunities to make mistakes Try New things or even grow With very little urgency in anything. And I can say that Despite loving myself , I had almost no confidence in myself Or my ability, I felt. No urgency to do anything Even when it was slowly rotting me from the inside And tell it built up into a mental breakdown and anxiety Despite that being a foreign emotion to me..   It's hard to act, When you lived in your head , your whole life, It feels too easy to give up before you try or before.You can continue trying Because it's hard And you never learned the meaning Of a process Before.. But it's worth it, It's. Something i'm working on, Because what scares me more than Trying and failing,  Is never trying and Dying having accomplished nothing. Absolutely nothing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “It’s a result of the world they live in.” 100% how can we expect people to make even more decisions when we have documented evidence with the decision fatigue just from the many decision in the grocery store, lets add in the entire internet and social media to boot. We are all making more decisions than we can process, it’s not getting easier it’s worse by the day.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We have 5 Gen Z kids. They moved out aged 16-19 to study in other cities. Two have graduated and have a permanent job in their own fields. Both of the boys have completed mandatory military service (we live in Finland). Two of the kids live with a partner. One of them will graduate college in the spring. I don’t see their life trajectory to be so different from my generation (Gen X).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 21 with two jobs (in healthcare) and bro just said idk what I wanna do or where I'm going 😭 bro most of us know we're just not chronically online enough to show that we have a life because we're too busy living it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Besides psychological reasons , safety reasons and grow up environment reasons, another major factor is the education system and the job system. There are so many extra added barriers to succeed. I talked to a 60 year bank lady and she told me that when she finished high school at 18, she got accepted in a bank job at 19. Now, if you want a good job, you need high grades, a bachelor's degree, experience, and somehow be perfect acing the interview 10/10.  Heck, the economy is so bad, people can't find jobs. College and University students are spending more time than ever chasing those perfect grades, instead of socializing or taking risks, or experience big life events like going to a sports tournament, or performing big on stage. The school system and the job market is turning everyone into introvert indoor all the time study BOTS with no confidence, self esteem, social skills, direction in life or goals in life. The society system wants more NPC.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For me a lot of it comes down to the hopelessness caused by the whole government situation ( I could lose access to healthcare so I’m paranoid about getting hurt if I drive for example)  also historically for me a lot of shame from making mistakes exists. My therapist believes since asserting myself as a child and teen usually led into being dismissed or being blamed for whatever reason I was unhappy ( for example if I was to tell an adult I didn’t feel comfortable doing something like wearing a swimsuit and asking to wear a t-shirt and shorts instead I would be told I was in the wrong for expressing my wants and saying I didn’t want something was called being difficult)   I worry about messing up, not only would messing up hurt myself but others around me. Family, friends, strangers.. I don’t want to accidentally do something wrong.  When it comes to work I’ve applied to so many places. I think the main issue comes down to less available ‘beginner jobs’ I could apply to McDonald’s and be rejected because of lack of experience. How do I get experience if literally all jobs want years of past experience?  I got fired from a grocery store for asking too many questions. I would want to confirm that I was doing things right and would ask specific questions.. apparently I’m supposed to just know what to do and I’m in the wrong for asking where the cleaning supplies are for example.   I’m neurodivergent, I want to make sure i understand instructions if im doing something important. I struggle with ‘implied’ and ‘unspoken’ things. Direct communication shouldn’t be viewed as annoying or being difficult.  I also am disabled, the accommodations I ask for aren’t be being difficult. I try to phrase things as “ I can’t do that this way, but I could do it this other way / I can’t to that, but I could do those other things “ Apparently I’m being lazy for not wanting to sublux my ribs/ hands/ shoulders.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i was 28 and had no idea what i wanted to do with my life. walked in the Navy recruiter's office and changed my life for the better. now everything i have is because i took that risk and signed on the dotted line. met some awesome people, learned a lot about myself, ate some great food, got in great shape (i miss being in that shape), and drank way too much alcohol but damn was it fun. im not saying you need to join the military because you lack direction but it might help you get on the right track. never know you might enjoy it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was born in 95 so technically millennial but I was very babied.   When I was 16 my family was afraid I’d burn myself cooking or I remember when I was around 10 I really wanted a skateboard but my mom was afraid I’d get hurt. My mom didn’t want me to drive in hs so I got my license when I was 18 because I told her I wanted to drive myself to college. My mom also didn’t let me get a job after I graduated hs because she was worried I would stop going to school.   It worked out for me, I was very loved, but I think I was so babied that I had a hard time in the real world. I still feel like a late bloomer in a lot of ways but I actually got married last year, I have a good job, and I live on my own, but I’m very afraid of having a child and I really struggle with decision making. I have a lot of anxiety and fears but I have pushed through to have a good and independent life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm so lucky I don't struggle with most of the problems my generation has. It feels good to be able to do the things you want to do.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I didn't go through the comments or anything but wanted to added:  Many of the people in my generation grew up watching their families hurt with divorce, abuse, or hating their career choice. I do think many GenZ folks are either consciously or unconsciously trying to avoid the same mistakes and frustrations they saw their family have.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: why get a drivers license when you can't afford a car
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When i got to be around 9 and i asked my mom for pizza, she told me if i wanted pizza bad enough then ill call. At first we didnt get pizza. But eventually i really wanted it and called. It sounded like a total child on the phone but i had my notes in front of me! Moral of story, will work for pizza 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I dont think it's just a gen z thing. My dad is Gen x and he's still unsure what to do in life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Quite literally the generation who has to deal with our predecessors saying “the next generation will handle it”. We can’t pass on the troubles like our parents gen could otherwise we will literally watch the last icebergs melt and are liable to be blamed for the awful air quality. I’m in no rush to be blamed by the children of the next gen for an issue I wish was taken seriously before I was alive
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I will say that I agree with most of the points, but I do want to add that the fear of making the wrong decision is not irrational. Millions of people go through midlife crises when they're in their 30's-40's because they chose wrong. I actually know someone who's only 23 and he's doing his masters in law right now and - even though he would never admit to this - regrets it. He's one of the kindest and selfless souls I know and got on the law track to help people, but he's also poor. There is no choice for him where he can make money and do good. His choices are private law or public defender. He's stuck - like so many Gen Z fear.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I wonder if not having a stay at home parent could have added to this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am 26, almost 27. I was just broken up with yesterday, I’ve been abused as a child and had my hand held. I have been told to go to therapy but I am scared of the cost of time, money, and trust. The only job I ever had was as a child actress in background roles. I am not skilled enough at art to be in an industry. I never got to graduate highschool, I am scared of wasting more time at college. I don’t want to stay with my bad family forever. At this rate I don’t know if I even want to be a mother anymore. I have disabilities that can get worse or kill me. I want a work life balance. I don’t see how I can ever afford my future. My family and I will be moving soon but we will still be in the same overpriced city.   I’m lost.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as a 22 year old, for me its not necessarily about starting for me. if there's something i want, im going to get it or do it. sometimes its more about maintaining the momentum. i think there's a fear of things ending, but i also think momentum requires constant risk taking and failing and at a certain point, i don't wanna keep going through it. this isn't to say i won't, or that i just halt my opportunities to avoid it -- but that doesn't mean i like it or crave it or enjoy. i delay it until im ready to take the step on my own at my own pace. i'm an achiever, a perfectionist, i like setting the glass ceiling and breaking it for myself..but its exhausting when i start trying to do it to prove to everyone that who i am is worthy. burnout is real.   sometimes it is about the hesitancy to start...other times, it's self preservation. and i think in all the shitty conditions we live in as humans, its okay for us to chose preservation before we're ready to fully start.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The start of this video is hard to hear we aren’t avoiding life milestones it’s literally that we can’t afford anything
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Growing up I spent 13-19 years old in psych hospitals and group homes I had so much trauma to overcome but also wasn’t able to “find myself/become myself” So now in adulthood as a 25 year old I am behind educationally and emotionally I’m in therapy and  thankfully doing better but the thought comparing where my mom was when she was 25 is crazy I still live at home do to my mental illness struggles and unable to afford to live on my own   As someone who has major depression and borderline personality disorder going to therapy for the rest of my life might be necessary for me to stay alive Currently I go once a week and maybe it will lessen but I would never discourage someone to not go to therapy long term That doesn’t help end the stigma although I do understand your point   I think 18 is not the right age to be called an adult I feel like 18-25 should be a different category with steps and after 25 you are a legal adult
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 37 and still wake up a lot of days saying to myself “what are you doing with your life”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well shit, 1989 falls at the cusp of Millennials and Gen X. No wonder so many things in this videos were so relatable.   Edit: Some of these points had me ready to throw a shoe because they were tough to process. Some of them are a hard FUCK NO not doing that and some were a yeah I should probably start doing that so my kid has a better shot at life. What a roller coaster of information. Thank you for sharing!

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Can't decide because I can fail. Can't fail, or I'll lose time. Lose time and lose money. Lose money, can't pay the bills (don't even mention a little treat one in a while). I'm happy to do anything as long as I'm sure it'll be long term (and ideally in my field, which is marine biology). And I'm not counting all the other mental barriers I've got living in this society. I was second best at school and the best in my class in college, but I still feel like there's no future for me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I find this somewhat true I constantly want to become more independent and not rely on my parents, but because of the economy I can’t afford independence.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have my permit, but finding time to finish practicing parallel parking which is all I need to finish to go take my test is so hard. I work full time at 19 and can't even consider going to college. I want to buy a car but my wages don't allow for me to even consider financing. It genuinely sucks especially because i have people breathing down my neck about it but I'm just not as lucky as they are. My mom, a single mother barely makes enough to cover stuff for my two younger brothers. I pay half of the bills which still takes up my entire pay. Im 19 and tired, we are tired.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: one MAJOR problem is that what is financially rewarded these days is short-term entertainment and the crippling obsession with vanity and aesthetics, which then bleeds out of social media and into every-day life. It's never been easier to make outfit videos or dance online and capture the attention of millions. And while THOSE people can pay their bills and travel often with ease, and feel fulfilled with it, it leads more impressionistic young folks to aspire to do that too -- but does the world really need more of that? - more fast fashion hauls going to waste, more focus on Hollywood culture, more mindless and numbing doom-scrolling? Even if these things paid the bills and made us fulfilled, we have LOST the sense of how important COMMUNITY is and don't look at the bigger picture. WELL-LOVED influencers will post photos of themselves at art galleries in front of pieces that depict the concept of some world issue, and obliviously overlook their overall part in it and issues like it. We need to stop rewarding trash culture.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's funny because Milennials at 25 were exactly the same. No one has everything solved by 25, the problem with gen Z is they overshare and get influenced really hard by social media and that spikes their anxiety. Nobody has a perfect life and progressively you'll stop living up to society, family or friends expectations.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This was so depressing yet so real
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If my parents could afford to buy me a car at 16-18 I would have gotten my license but if I can’t afford to buy a car what’s the point in getting my license? I have paid bills since I was 16 and I make 13 dollars an hour working part time (4 days a week around 28 hours a week) I’m in college full time too and I am starting to learn budgeting.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z here: We’re constantly exposed to endless career options online, which makes it hard to focus or choose a path. Many of us chase glamorized jobs for status or money and overlook realistic opportunities like trades. We’ve also been sheltered and overexposed to media, leaving us unprepared, overwhelmed, and afraid of making the wrong choices … especially when we’ve seen how student debt affected millennials.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 3:27 I had always wanted to drive but my parents won’t let me cause they fear it will raise their insurance, I have saved up for a car and a year of insurance(relied on gig computer repair and tutoring) and at 16 I graduated at 15 and I am stuck at home cause I can’t afford college or get a job cause I live in the country and public transportation is impossible to get so now I am stuck within 300ft sq.(my room) also before boomers criticize me for being lazy and not getting a bike or walking, the nearest bus stop is an hr of walking and so is the nearest store, as for bike, I bought one and have to constantly replace my tire tubes cause of all the stickers in my area, and everyone is too busy to carpool. Getting uber requires someone 18+ and my parents refuse to download the app saying I would be wasting my money cause uber was expensive (they are right) however they haven’t given me many options. I still have drive to seek independence but parents make it impossible, you turn 18 and are expected to go to college and then move back in. Parents are not helping gain independence
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Millennial who considers herself accidentally  "trained helpless" in many areas of life..all I can say is it sucks to me to have to learn the stuff people seem to have learned from ages 2-22 in my Generation or before in my 20s,30s,40s + all the other crap that has happen, is happening and will be happening.  But I'm also not envying Gen Z I mean what kind of future could they possibly foresee? I am already scared for Zalpha's and Alpha's becoming local canon fudder.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 11:43 I don’t necessarily agree with this statement at that point this would be the parent’s fault.. and that’s a small sign of narcissism. Also in my opinion even if a parent has few children you can still teach a child how to be independent.. you just let them do things by themselves and help them when it’s needed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Can you reverse the effects of not being allowed to explore independence in childhood?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly a lot of this just sounds like a lot of the same problems that ever generation has gone through since Capitalism took over our lives. I faced this in my twenties and I'm the gen before these kids. They act like 20 something is old, it's not old. Retirement looks so different for everyone, milestones look different for everyone. The biggest difference I have seen is the being chronically online all the time. A lot of us have always gone through this, it's just now it's known to everyone all over the place because of social media. And you made a huge point in that there are a ton more options now so making decisions is a lot harder than it used to be. It used to be you picked something at some point and lived with your choice, now they don't know what to pick. I hate shopping anymore. I used to enjoy it. It's not just too dang frustrating. It's not just the economy like everyone is saying. Every generation has gone through bad economic times before, it's just now we have too much of everything, too much food, too many toys (for kids and adults), too much stuff in general, too many choices in careers, too many people applying to jobs, etc. It's harder than ever to stay away from things we don't like because we are seeing it everywhere. This is however the first generation to have grown up seeing everything before they are old enough to be mature enough when to know when to say no. It used to be childhood was for figuring yourself out and finding your thing, now its happening later and later.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen z has immigrant parents too, I personally am rather ambitious, but this situation is due to coddling and the current cost of living is almost unattainable
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Is it adulthood to just follow what has been said for as long as you cannot remember by a group of people that never cared about the future and the real consequences their acts will have on the environment and the future generations? Or is it to see that even tho there are mayors systemic problems, trauma and drama being created by the only way acceptable to act and still do it because you have to? Or is it to try to find a real way to face those problems even tho you might not have the means, or the energy, or the intelectual resources or the power to change one entire system where everyone just acts and reacts as they are expected even if that will end up hurting them? I think that gen Z are trying to wake up on a really slept world that doesn’t want them too. They are afraid because there is no other forward in this current world and they are the first to realize but don’t know how to do it or how to say it and being heard by the ones that have already surrender.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As someone who is familiar with burnout from a young age, find a passion. Focus on discovering yourself again. Doesn't have to be expensive. Like idk, maybe try a recipe you wouldn't consider under normal circumstances and see if you like it or if you don't (you can always tweak recipes to suit your tastes after all).  YOU have to find meaning in the little things otherwise you will eventually succumb to depression and unless you have the resources to get the right treatment for you, that would only add more stress to your life.  Granted, that's what works for me. I've felt burnout from the age of 11 (right around the time my anger issues started to be manageable and stuff like that). I still feel remnants of burnout (and probably undiagnosed depression among other things) but I'm not giving up no matter how useless it all might seem.  I've planned for countless scenarios and none of them have me doing nothing even if I will most likely feel numb for at least one of said scenarios 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How many people commenting didn’t watch the video?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video feels like a big slap in the face
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a millennial I saw this with my peers as well. LOTS of us in our 30's still haven't Launched. I will say that what seams to be a HUGE divide I noticed is that as a Millenial with Gen X parents I grew up quicker with thicker skin and most of my friends who are struggling have Boomer parents..... This seams to be a trend where the younger your parents when they have you the easier it is to launch because you lived through their "Peter Pan" years while they figured it out.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bar is high, guidance is lacking, believed in lies from previous generation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m wrapping up my masters in counseling and need to clarify some of the therapy stuff. The TikTok you showed about trauma is based on the polyvagal theory and it is just wrong. Mainstream neuroscientists accept that the best evidence shows that trauma is stored in the brain, not the body. Bessel van der Kolk and The Body Keeps The Score, while being wildly popular, is presenting a fringe idea in neuroscience that we do not have evidence for. This is why he promotes EMDR which he says isn’t an exposure therapy. The first problem is that EMDR IS an exposure therapy according to pretty much any serious researcher on the subject, although they will admit it is lighter exposure than the more effective therapies. The American Psychological Association considers EMDR a second line therapy because it is less safe, less effective, not as well researched, and not as suitable for diverse populations as first line trauma therapies. The first line therapies, prolonged exposure and cognitive processing therapy, are exposure therapies. Exposure is important to healing trauma because facing the trauma helps build resiliency, which you said was a good thing throughout your video. These therapies don’t work when they’re rushed and the client isn’t ready, so you have to build a safe space, but not to coddle the client and instead to help them safely face their trauma and gain resiliency. So the goal of these therapies are actually to build resiliency, and when done properly they are considered the safest and most effective therapies. Nobody ever does, but I’d consider redacting or amending the part about trauma because that idea about trauma not being stored in the brain has dangerously led people to seek less effective treatments or no treatments at all. Look up APA trauma therapies to read more about first and second line treatments, which will back up what I’m saying about the importance of exposure being necessary when healing from trauma.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im starting to realize i should job hop to get paid more instead of staying at the same company for 4 years, and barely get a raise, also i wasnt driven in school but i was more driven at my job. because i picked to be an arcade tech, something that interested me, i dont regret it as ive learned alot of skills, and met some good friends through it but man the only reason i can even live is because of my parents.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Giw van we thrive when things chnage so fast?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They're right to be scared of getting older, it sucks. You lose your passions, you become numb, your get ugly, which means nobody wants you anymore, people stop caring about you because it's not worth helping you anymore since your potential is already spent, everything hurts, things stop being enjoyable, there's nothing to look forward to, nothing to plan for, nothing is new anymore and it gets worse every year. Enjoy your youth while you can, make the most of it, it's over faster than you think.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You mention it briefly at the end but I really think it’s hard to understate how the current state of the world contributes to gen z’s inertia. The world they are growing up into is one that appears to be ending.   There is higher wealth inequality than ever before, authoritarian (moving towards fascist) governments are gaining power all over the world including in the U.S., climate change is already taking effect and everyone now knows it’s too late to do anything about it, and AI is going to disrupt the economy to the point where it’s impossible to make a real career plan.   If 20 year olds don’t want to grow up, I think intellectual honesty and compassion demand that we recognise the rationality in that. Not meaning to downplay the other factors you discuss here which I do think are real, I just think that if we focus only on individual psychology, parenting styles etc, then we are really missing the bigger picture.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here… I worked with a girl, also millennial but younger millennial, and she was in therapy for life like since she was a kid. And she still is. And she’s the most miserable person with no friends that I know. 😢

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video is what a like to call a generational pick me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Most or fail to realize us gen Z people went through a world wide pandemic during our most important developmental years
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a 19 year old middle-eastern/balkan (Turkish) boy I understand the points in the video but I dont think its only (I think parenting is 50% of it at most.) about parenting. My parents didnt just throw me in the street like a lot of middle eastern families but they are fairly educated people who reads and tries to be good parents, When I was a kid they could be really protective at times but when I think about it they would also let me walk to a grocery store more then a km away in a foreign country when I couldnt speak their language at all. What I m trying to say is I think my parents was pretty balanced with protecting your child and letting him do things himself and i believe it worked out fine. Now my main point is that even tho I was raised well, independent and I want to move out I simply cant, how tf am I supposed to pay rent after applying to LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE JOB I could in my city and getting rejected by all of them. Another example in my life is the career I choose to pursue, all my life my parents said to me that I should do the thing i like and I tried to find that for years my whole highscool years was literally thinking about what I want to do with my life. I always enjoyed studying/talking English so I chose to pursue a career in foreign languages and guess what everyone around me including my parents demorolized me like crazy cause the profession I chose was not to their liking. This might be controversial but another thing is that we have to pay a price for every single mistake we make in this age, I dont know how it worked in the past but right now everthing sticks to you forever. When I was in second year of highschool I got caught while copying in an exam (which is a bad thing and ofc there should be punishments.) and believe it or not it is still in my record, when i apply to a college they can see it and it was a big trouble when I was changing highschools. In these times if you get drunk and get arrested for a ridicilus reason like public urinating or end up fighting with somone whatever it is it will be in your criminal record forever so how can we go mad and do mistakes. Last 2 years of my life I v been trying to be an adult I really am but in the world we are living in right now it just feels impossible to be an adult at such a young age.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 14. I love space. I know that even if I wanted to do something with that, it’s not happening. “Ooh, I wanna learn physics and become an astrophysi-“ ❌ My department’ll get cut as soon as I get the job and I’ll basically get fired the day of. “Ooh, I wanna-“ ❌ Don’t even say that one, the chance you get to do it is already low enough.  I don’t want to die. I wish I was never born to begin with.  I don’t care how much time I have, or how young I am, or how much there is out there. I could try for a fucking million years and it wouldn’t be any different.  I haven’t cried in 7 years, and I’m shit at everything I like with no redeeming qualities or social skills. I haven’t felt truly happy and at peace in my entire life. I feel like a philosophical zombie every single day. The only reason I’m alive right now is to see the artist who’s keeping me alive perform this week, and after that’s over, I genuinely don’t know if I’ll make it a year. I don’t even feel depressed, I just feel lazy, which is even worse because I can’t do anything about that without fixing the problems I can’t do anything about.  I’d rather have a guaranteed failure without wasting my time than waste my life chasing another inevitable failure.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The drive to perfection is because of the fear of being ridiculed by others. People nowadays, most prominent is the generation that grew up in era of social media live in day to day basis in social media. And sharing their opinions there is opening the chance of being ridiculed. The life without social media is lonely if you became active in it for years. It's like you know your friend is being in a party and you outside. The party is shit, people are shit, but that's the only place you can belong to.   I have been born in 2005 and I don't know if I'm still belong in the generation talked here yet I can still remember the time where people can interact outside.    And also punching someone is possible outside. Yes it's bad and we should find other ways to regulate our emotions, but being in a negative "party" everyday without the choice of punching someone can drive someone nuts.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We have the worst rent / housing to income ratios in modern history, that explains at least half of the cause behind these problems.   Until we stop treating shelter like a commodity to be traded, this trend is going to continue more and more.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: guy in 1950s eh ill be a milkman and make enough for house 2-4 kids a car and maybe a boat if I do some overtime.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 40. In my 20’s I didn’t know what to do with my life either 🤷🏼‍♀️ it’s not a Gen Z issue. The issue is that people aren’t given the chance to try different things to see what they like plus being so focused on what society implies on what people can and can’t do.   I’ve always loved carpentry and building things from wood. Never pursued it because my family looked down upon it. I missed the boat to buy a house so when I do, I’ll be doing carpentry like I always wanted.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Gen Z, I feel like this phenomenon has little to nothing to do with being too coddled or protected. I deal with this same issue and I had a very traumatic childhood with abuse from my parents and that’s the reality for many people my age. It has a LOT more to do with being discouraged from the corruption in this system we live in, being raised with social media, the rise of AI, and most of all, the economy and how everything is much more expensive.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I so enjoy your podcast. I look forward to watching it whenever you post an episode. You're doing a wonderful job with it. ♥
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: thank you for reiterating that. i'm doing the same with MSW & pointed out that 3 of the references she used were life coaches & not therapists, then i went on to mention TF-ACT, TF-CBT, & finding trauma informed therapist who use empirically backed modalities that don't involve pseudoscience & "trendy therapies" (e.g EMDR & Brainspotting) - from 2 people with no college experience & 1 with a bach in philosophy.  this is important stuff for people with an audience to relay

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The thing of over-theraping is suggested to what happened to Marilyn Monroe, reinforcing her insecurities from the times of living in orphanages and foster families, instead of healing her. As for the decision making - I don't have decision paralysis, becouse the other choice might be better, I have certainity that it will result in fail, so I don't make decision at all, not worth it.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You couldn't pay me enough to be a Gen-Z'er in a human-rightless country like USA. I don't have a great glamorous life either, but I live in a country where the state sees to it that you can have the basic necessities of life (shelter, food, healthcare, utilities and Internet) even if you didn't have a high-paying job.  If things look bleak to me, I daren't even think of how awful it is to someone about 20 years younger. I don't blame them disappearing into the make-believe world of the Internet. It's what I do too.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Therapist here 👋 This is why somatic based therapies are so important and much much more effective than cognitive behavioral therapies. Additionally, I have noticed that there’s a newish narrative that is gaining steam and that is “I’m in therapy and that is the work.” And it’s not. Like Ashley said, 1 hour a week does not a healing journey make! It must be applied throughout the week to build the new neural pathways that affect real change. Excellent video as always!!

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the decrease in people with driver’s licenses in 2021 can be contributed to the pandemic in 2020. Testing locations were closed for a majority of the year, and if they weren’t most people were being careful about close distances you’d have to be in in a car.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For me it simply feels overwhelming
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 34:42 this is the key right here!!!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was born in 1992 and thus I am a millennial but perhaps it's due to a mixture of having been born 6 weeks prematurely and being autistic, that I'm a lot more like a Gen Z person than a millenial, at least in terms of finding it hard to adult and making decisions and fearing rejections.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here - sorry y’all, you’re not alone. And you have it harder than even we did, you’re not imagining it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You should ask these parents "Who in the world do you admire?" And then ask them if they think that person was parented in the same way they are parenting their child. If they think they grew up in the same environment. Do you think they grew up with an easy life? Or do you think they had challenges they had to overcome themselves? And then if they think their parenting methods are going to help their child be able to succeed in the way they have.  It's not perfect but it will get a person thinking.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I want to take that first step but unfortunately my full-time job in the industry I got my degree in doesn't pay enough to afford that. I work in archtiecture
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 3:33 this was so cute lol ☺️ also angel numbers!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think there is also something to be said about the fact that America and modern western society is very unique in this idea of nucleaf family. That you leave your parents and take on life all on your own as opposed to just adding to your already stable family and learning to contribute. The pressue to do things this way is just ridiculously high. Not just for Gen Z but even for Boomers who were literally the wealthiest generation ever. If it was hard for them if feels damn near impossible for Gen Z
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 28:55 yeah, incredible access to immense amounts of information/knowledge; yet, very few people - regardless of generation - actually take the time and energy, and seek out to expand their awareness, intake + ponder upon the great amounts of info/knowledge that is so widely available.  Too distracted by endless entertainment slop, shirt clips, media sensations, famous things, trends...  All distractions and programmings that are altering all of our perceptions / viewings.   That's on large why there's all the "oh no I can't make a choice..."  Yeah, cause you haven't actually worked on your self to change things, to expand your awareness, or to heal trauma. It takes great effort and an actual decision that must be followed through to do this, but that's how one actually makes some differences in their life + state of being. Being so "indecisive" isn't some crazy disorder or whatever. It's, most commonly, coming down to a total lack of displine / self control, total lack of responsibility and accountability. Among other factors of course, but generally saying, those are some of the biggest ones.... A ton are effected by having no confidence / feeling if self worth... Because they listen to the medias + compare themselves, subconscious or not, to everything external... Which again. Right back to a lack of discipline / actual control of ones own decisions / choices. Of course, many don't want to face these things... Because, owning up / taking accountability of ones own decisions, includes accepting the bad ones that have been made... And it requires the seeking / effort to Know Thyself. Temet Nosce.  Of course, as many will openly admit, sitting in silence is not something they allow. Any silence must be filled with music, or a video playing, or something... Because it's ",scary," or "makes me anxious".... Yeah, no duh... Cause one has put off owning up to everything that's occured in ones life. Yes, some things are ofc not all ones own fault, some things outside of one do occur. Awareness and Acceptance to Accountability will obviously allow one to know this, and thus, be fine with it ....  Of course, all this said, and unfortunately, because of the extreme addiction to social media / tech devices, and the general state of western society and its moral$/values -- rather, total lack of -- many will not ever open up and go down this "path".... Path of truth, of knowing thyself, of actually taking the reins.... And so, the toxic, disgusting, depressing BS will continue to ail the many...  Most people, esp younger, have horrid literary skills... No reading / writing at all. Writing anything more than like 3 sentences online will trigger repeated phrases such as "bro wrote a book, bro is writing chapters, dudes writing an essay, I'm not reading all dat", and etc etc....  Which is very openly an effect caused by the technology/screens, and especially the social media, and is a fine display of how intensely it has shaped new societal "values", as well as the populace state of mind / state of being.... Very warped, and not in a good way....

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The future always seems uncertain now but me looking back  that’s part of why I joined the military. I refused to be stuck living at home with no direction, discipline, and limited mentorship. Worked out pretty good so far. Im stronger  than ever financially, physically, mentally, and socially. It’s only up from here. Now it’s just building a family but I can’t be single for that part. I (M25) don’t know that I’ll ever be rich but I know that with God I’ll find a way to be ok. After all it’s not about succeeding as much as it is about starting. And that’s biblical.   Zechariah 4:10 “Do not despise these small beginnings, for the Lord rejoices to see the work begin.”   Got rejected by Raising Canes at the start and now I’m making way more than I would’ve at that place anyway.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm about 99% sure that my sibling has peter pan syndrome. They said living away from mom and dad was the worst mistake they ever made and they live at home now rent free at 32. I moved out at 21 or 22 and it was the best decision I've ever had. also I'm a millenial, graduated in 2010, into the recession, no jobs, couldn't afford college, worked low wage jobs, now I'm disabled (thanks covid) and I'll never have a house lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 22 graduated college last May. I spent my whole senior year applying for jobs and looking for apartments in a whole new city.

After a year of moving to a different city and working that same job I’m also starting my masters degree. Am I planning my future yes but am I also enjoying my 20s yes. I also got engaged 4 months ago. I’m enjoying all my hard work and still planning out my future.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am 25, I live in a flat with my fiancé and two cats, we both have cars and plans to take a credit to buy a house. In fact, everyone in my friend circle has at least one car, with the exception of my best friend, who reaches everything by train, bus and bicycle. He works in the metal industry, so a labour job I think you call it. None of us went to college or university, we all started an apprenticeship after school and none of us have big money issues. Sure some of us don't save a lot, but we have enough to live comfortably I don't know if it's because we live in Germany and never have to really worry to completely fail, since we simply cannot end up completely homeless if we don't want to, or if it's because we (my friend group that is) are good at our jobs, but I honestly don't see much of the points in the video here, not in my bubble at least. Are y'all okay there over the ocean?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think one issue that I've run into as a millennial is that I'm constantly being blamed for making the "wrong" choices despite working really hard.  I'm not claiming that I've always made good choices, but it definitely feels like success for me has always been just out of reach no matter what I try to do about it.  It's absolutely killed my motivation to do anything because I feel like I'm just doing more work for more blame and more failure, and honestly, who wants that in life?  I think that Gen-Z inherently knows this.  I think that part of their decision fatigue is knowing that success is really hard to acheive in most cases and that they will be blamed for it (or might even blame themselves) when it goes bad (and there is a high probability that it will).  It's not a fear of failure per-se, it's a frustration that success feels impossible.  Why choose a life path when success is always being moved further out of reach and when you will get blamed for not choosing better regardless of what you choose?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a Gen-X'er, I feel really sorry for Gen-Z's, I wouldn't like to be growing up in the world right now and being young like they are.  Most I can say is this, pretty much everything I have learned in life is from not just failure, but complete and utter f*ck-up's.  Does failure suck? Damned right it does, but here is something that was said to me in college that changed my life.  "There is no such thing as failure as long as you learn something from it, you only truly fail if you f*ck up and learn nothing."  So, I go into everything knowing at some point I'm going to screw up, I'll make notes, I'll ask questions, then I'll screw up, sit back and look at why I screwed up, update my notes, then start again, the more I fail the more determined I get to learn more and do more.  As for life itself, as long as you got a roof over your head, food in your stomach, some creature comforts, hopefully decent health, nothing else matters, everything else is just eye candy.  Also, my last tip on deciding on what to do next is this: get 3 pieces of paper and a pen.  Paper 01: Write down everything you think or feel you have to do. Paper 02: Refine that list into what you can actively change or achieve right here right now. Paper 03: list them into order of the fastest to achieve at the top to the most lengthy / difficult one at the bottom.  Then start on paper 03 from task 1, then as you get each one out the way you can strike them off the list, so you are constantly seeing achievements for your time and effort, doesn't seem pointless.  Anything you can't change in the here and now or anything that is out of your control, f*ck it, nothing you can do about it so just deal with it if or when it comes to be.  Pass that onto any Gen-Z'er you may know, it should help them out.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The millennial grey is a great example of one of the first issues with globalisation of taste. And I haaaaaate it. You see it everywhere now. Heck some clothes in specific colours aren’t even being sold anymore while previously they tried to offer a bigger palette. Now it’s max 4 colours and it’s never the colour that suits me best. Mustard yellow is THE colour for me, but it’s so damn rare. And baby clothes are so boooring. And people hate it. But still buy it because they still need clothes. So the companies keep doing it. It’s a vicious cycle.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Personal experience on the parenting section: my daughter is 3 and I definitely see the overbearing parenting of our generation. In general, my husband and I don’t involve ourselves in our daughter’s playground or play date squabbles. Kids can work it out on their own, and we talk to our daughter afterward on what she should do and react when kids act a certain way. Of course, If she’s being the problem, we correct that behavior immediately. I have many friends who say “come get me if that kid is being mean and I’ll talk to them”. My opinion is that this takes away a lot of your kids independence and teaches them they can’t fight their own battles. I am obviously there to offer any comfort and coaching to my kid, but stepping in is removing all adversity from their life and is not realistic once they reach teen and adulthood. We are trying to give our daughter the confidence to face her own battles, but to know we’ll always be there for her.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am a millennial (30) but I sort of disagree that doors have to close as you get older! I agree with your main point, that it's probably best to pick a path and focus on skills and choices to actually move you forward.  But I am now reaching success and financial stability in my career, which opens the door for doing more of what I really want and trying new things. Grad school, trips abroad, volunteering, etc.  And I also don't think people should let age hold them back from trying things or making changes, we only get this one life. And life definitely doesn't end at 30!   I got divorced at 29, so I actually feel like mine is getting way better 😅  And this is also relevant to the economic crisis that teens and younger adults are facing. I'm not sure if the opportunities I had, even just 10 years ago, will be available to others.   My first apartment in Atlanta was $650 and I could pay for it working retail while going to college. That same apartment is $1400 now, not updated, and minimum wage hasn't increased at all.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am gen z 22 no job no uni ...i am stuck here trying to get into med school cause unfortunately i live in the middle east and honestly at least here its the only job that is guaranteed to actually pay off . That and i dont want to disappoint my parents and i am really into math/biology.. i graduated when i was 16 at the top of my class . I know 5 languages. And then i just burnt out , became very addicted to social media , couldnt go to the college i wanted because of expense and honestly the  immigration process is hell . So i had to study to get into a more affordable one and honestly i couldnt do it.  I am definitely going to med school next year but by then i will be 23 . I have to study at least 12 hours a day . I am so tired all the time and i cant find joy in most things i used to anymore. Last i just biught some books to do tests today and i just felt empty .i used to love doing it.  And my country is on the verge of collapse kind of , like we're running out of water and somehow thats like not even the worst of it. I feel tired and stupid and ig i just wanted to vent. And least you can say i am not a quitter dont know if its smart or if im just too stubborn for my own good. I hate how much this has hurt my mother.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've type a comment for the last hour but then decided to delete it as it felt too much like trauma dumping. 😅 The only thing I'll say is "I'll do it later" is in most cases just a lie you tell yourself. I thought so too. Now I'm 28 and it feels like I wasted the past 10 years of my life, still live with my parents and never had a relationship and anytime I go online, watch any kind of media or talk to anyone I'll feel like I'm behind in life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like traumas of childhood will still happen no matter what we do.  Look at gen z, they were nurted like no other, but they sill got so much trauma. The more i do therapy the more i realise my kids will have something to talk to the therapist even if i jump out of my skin tryin to avoid that. So let them  have their faliers and handfull of traumas. Unless its serious avoidance and neglect or toxic punishments, its gonna be fine. Just save some money on their therapist.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it's likely because this world is actually horrible and makes us feel unmotivated as a result

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wow, my parents were not at all overprotective. They were pretty hands of. Especially because they are immigrants, I still feel like I’m experiencing some of these symptoms. I was overprotective of my self as a kid and didn’t push myself to do anything I didn’t want to do. So I did this to myself instead of my parents. So I’m a bit behind of others that did have hands on parents and pushed them to do stuff.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Felt useless when I couldn’t figure out French homework despite this being necessary for my major and felt like I disappointed my whole entire family
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The reason is simple we know more about the world than are parents and the world is on fire
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: re the aspect of therapy: i don't fully agree with the part about talking about trauma being bad and keeping it in the past. most people can't effectively keep it in the past if they don't fully process it (which according to the evidence involves talking about it, or creating a trauma narrative). unfortunately, I think the issue is (as someone 1.5 years away from getting their phd in clinical psychology) that SOOO many therapists do not use evidence-based therapies/techniques when people go to therapy. if someone has trauma there are actually ways of treating that (i.e., writing a trauma narrative; exposure therapy) rather than sitting there and "spilling tea." Even for things like depression and anxiety, there are evidence based treatments for that. I work in a hospital yeah and ask people almost everyday if they've been in therapy before. When I hear what other therapists have done with them, I am constantly appalled. Unfortunately, too many therapists think that they can just do whatever they want and it will end up benefiting the patient. that is absolutely not true. And I'm absolutely not naive to think that all evidence based therapy works for every single person without adaptation. I'm a Health equity researcher, so I know that isn't true. ultimately, we need to start with the evidence. you bring up a good point that people And therapy for the rest of their life... I don't think that there's not necessarily anything wrong with this attitude. However I don't think it's necessary either. A lot of this actually probably comes from the lack of evidence based treatment and the lack of connection that we have in our society. People look forward to having that person that gives them their full attention each week or every other week for a whole hour. They can be their authentic self not have any judgment. That connection is healing. It's not necessarily because they have problems that they need to keep working on but there is a level of suffering that is almost unavoidable in such a disconnected society, So for someone who has resources, going to therapy can be one way to mitigate that pressure.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 15:25 there's no need to pick yourself up if you haven't fallen yet
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: jesus christ! about the therapy section. the tiktok clip shown (Lauren McGauley) is a COACH, which you can call yourself without even a High School education; she's NOT a therapist with licensure. Trauma being "stored in the subcortical 'subconscious' part of the brain" is not accurate or anatomically possible. Adele Wang: also a "Life Coach" & no academic credentials. Abigail Shrier received two separate Bachelor degrees in Philosophy: also not a scientist. How does this constitute citation/vetting of sources of something so important?  i know psychotherapy (i.e. "talk therapy") is the most well-known one in the pop-sphere, but even a sliver of that has "recalling trauma." EMDR is trendy right now, & has one of the highest instances of being retraumatized.   to give hope: those are a drop in the therapy sphere. Ego State Therapy with a trauma-infromed therapist, TF-ACT (trauma-focused acceptance & commitment therapy), TF-CBT (trauma based cognitive behavioral therapy) & any other trauma-infromed therapist or modality takes all of that into account.  vet your therapist if to find a TF one. that needs to be said w.r.t. "retraumatizing," & beneficial therapies/therapists/modalities. (betterhelp sucks, as does AI therapy.  but i know we all have capitalism to contend with, so sincerest good luck out there, comrades 😪)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If I could broadcast one message to my fellow Zoomers (I was born in 2006), it would be have faith in yourself and that things will workout.  Just absolutely never give up. Push, push and push some more. Then, if things don't workout, at least you can say you gave everything and carry no regrets.   Life is entirely unpredictable. Almost everything you do, and will do, is down to the actions of someone or something else - let go of control and ride the wave of chaos. The best way I can phrase it is like this - life feeds us plot lines but it's us who writes the story.  But then again, I'm only 19, what do I know?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't see being youthful and enjoying 'childlike wonders' like Easter egg hunts as anything bad, so long as people also take care of themselves and their necessary priorities. It's akin to the furry fandom for me. A lot of people who are in high-stress jobs like to cut loose and escape into fantasy to balance their lives out and relax. Nothing wrong with it, unless you let it rule your life!

And society blinds itself into a corner by nullifying possibilities that aren’t selected to hold value to itself… And people wonder why they did everything right only to end up dying alone and confused in a nursing home where your peers isolate themselves trying to find the truth in their paradigms. You have not won the spiritual war after all this “progress”… while your testament may wither, you have yet to grow in spirit children, simply because you do not remember us Memento Mori🎭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Peter Pan syndrome is maybe the most popular way to describe men who never grow up, but Carl Jung goes way more into depth with the idea. His version is called (I may be spelling this wrong) ‘puer aeturnus’. A YouTube channel called Eternalised made an excellent video on it that I visit often for introspection. If anyone reading is particularly interested in this topic, I’d suggest looking into it- especially men. You’ll be surprised how many boxes you may or may not check.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When I was a teenager we looked down upon “posers” and “sellouts”. Now everyone poses and sells all of themselves. I was always a skeptic even of the skeptics. The screen generation has been force-fed from inception. They are unhappy because they are suddenly having the rude awakening that the algorithm was never in their best interest and only a return to their hearts guidance can get them back on the path of qualitative discernment. Let’s all stop buying from Amazon already.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: However, I will say that, I’m independent. I’m hesitant to ask for help because that’s a more self issue or whatever you can call it. Yet, I was coddled but very much secluded to myself, I was in farmer/food advocated spaces when I was younger, I was bad kid growing up. Yet, all this growing up made me realize this shit isn’t fun and made myself extremely closed off and jaded to everything around me.  Wtf am I getting at?  I want to also succeed, I want to find my meaning in life. I have been taught life skills from my mom, how to be diligent, how to be on time for work. I take work seriously and get worried if I miss a day or a minute late to work.  And I feel like a disappointment when I cannot find my meaning, when I’m scared to find my meaning.  Every weekend when I’m done with classes, I go home and work. That’s the only two spaces I will ever go unless dragged along somewhere with family.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's not only Gen Z.. This has cascaded into late Millenials as well
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We have no money. There is no money trickling down to us. Reaganomics ruined us before we were even born. Corporations bought out our politicians and our world and has made it incredibly difficult to make a living wage. It has also made the job market for young adults a nightmare. Funding was cut for universities which absolutely demolished our chances at getting into graduate programs that allow you to work/study or get grants to go. Health insurance is insanely expensive. You pay for rent, utilities, and food and you dont have money left over for your phone bill, your car insurance, your health insurance, gas money, and emergencies that pop up because we can only afford shit cars that break down and live in shit apartments that are infested or breaking down. We do not have a future. Social security is dead. We are tired of working slave wages and being taken advantage of by corporations. That is what gen z is dealing with. Being unable to grow up is a symptom of economic dysfunction. America is not the economic powerhouse it once was. Corporations killed american industries and american self sufficience.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: lowkey but i also think americans want things to go so quickly. im turning twenty and i just finished hs and so did most of my friends and this is very normal. im not going to uni before a couple of years from now. idk im fine w being in my twenties and not knowing what to do, cause now is the time to find out. and this isnt a new thing btw, thats just how the (education) system is set up, my dad didnt start uni until he was like 28
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im 25, gen z, and still no license. ive also been through 2 cars because i got hit, twice, and was totalled while trying to learn. im actually ok with gen z not having their licenses, stay the fuck off the road
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel as though my generation is kind of split down the middle. Not just because this wasn’t my experience growing up, but because I sense our older gen X parents parented differently than the younger gen x and older millennials. I was born in the tail end of the first half of gen z in 2004. My parents were born in the 70s. I was a casual relationship oopsie! My parents were not prepared to have me, and both well into their 20s. My dad was a political activist and artist, he spent his free time at protests and tripping on acid while drawing comic books in his attic. My mother was a bartender and a hair washer at the local luxury salon. She was also an alcoholic. I had a heaping load of trauma from my mother, but my father balanced it out. He always encouraged my individuality and independence, learning through experience and figuring something for myself. If I had a question, I was taken to the library to find a book to answer my question. Which is how I discovered my love for books. When I found friends down the street, all I had to do was tell my dad I was going to play and I’ll be home before dark. Our only rules were to stay within the block and not ride our bikes in the alley on trash day. I had no tech but I was never interested in it, because my dad introduced as much fun into my life as possible. I was always told, I am a woman, I am strong, I am intelligent, and I have the power to move any wall that gets in my way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im 28 and i think some people would say i'm an elder gen z/ baby millennial. i don't drive yet but i just got my G1. i see people my age having kids and getting married and i'm confused about it because i can barely afford an apartment, nvm a 2 bedroom, a kid and a car. Perhaps if you have parents who are in a position to help you with a downpayment, a second hand car and hands on time with their grandchildren than it is possible to launch a future but it is very difficult to prepare for adulting with little to no support from parents and not being able to save since i moved out at 18. I have done 5 years of post secondary and work in healthcare and still can't afford a car while m aking student loan payments and taxes. granted, i live downtown toronto.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think it does have to do a lot with comparison and constantly comparing ourselves to the made of lives of people on the internet and ofc economy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Very thought provoking video! Points I agree and disagree with. 1. I see the ways in which gen z is stunted, but I think there’s more to the explanation than simply a lack of personal responsibility. It’s ROUGH rn in the states. Has been since Covid. There was no plan for the kids. I graduated undergrad spring 2020 to a closed job market and was furloughed for 2-3 months. Thankfully I received unemployment during that time or I’d have to move home to my mom’s small apartment. Life would have been so different if I didn’t get to keep my independence. Most of gen z faced similar or worse circumstances. However comma,,, I see the lack of resilience and unnecessary fears from gen z too. It’s so sad, why close yourself off from potential joy? Why quit before you try? There’s responsible cautiousness, calculating risk before acting, and then there’s succumbing to fear, never trying anything if it risks SOME type of failure. That’s no way to live.  2. Hot take on therapy!! Not sure I agree that therapy needs to have an “end date”. Maybe for folks like me who don’t suffer chronic illness, but for those who battle chronic conditions, they do need consistent access to therapy. Therapy is for everyone, no matter who you are or what you’ve been through. It took me for damn ever to go to therapy bc I always felt “not mentally ill enough” which was so unfair to myself. So glad I went at a time when I was ready to be honest about my experiences and sort my shit out.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Tbh I think at least one big reason could be that gen z has nothing to look forward to with being an adult. I am a millennial and when we grew up we had a hopeful perspective about these adulting things (not as much as previous generations either but still). But look at gen z. It's known fact to everyone now that a job doesn't pay enough, that climbing the social letter is a lie unless you are already rich, the rise of fascism, colonial wars, COVID, and the inevitable climate change. Why would you want to be an adult when there are no good reasons to become one? I too struggle with finding a point in this and even though I have worked for years now, live on my own, make decision am deeply unhappy because there is nothing that promises a future.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: you cant even blame this on us as gen zers bc the world built up before us that had momentum and success vs our world everyone is struggling new grads cant find jobs in and now face a lengthy amount of time  example 3 years , were at an all time high of inflation / tariffs , on the verge of homelessness for young adults , all while the internet seems to make either seem like were thriving and playing pretend or dont care we dint built these systems generations before us did we dint ask for ai to replace human jobs they did , we weren't the cause of horrific events so if im told to grow up again id tell them to fix the problem because it wasn't mine to start with and its not only mine
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Only our current culture would celebrate bringing back abusive parenting, extra drug/alcohol consumption, forced romantic relationships, and sensible expectations of a job market, and then in the same breath blame Gen Z for being brainrotten due to "those damned phones". I LOVE how these internet junkies they think we can solve third spaces and global warming just by physically and tangibly destroying younger generation's phones and censoring their internet.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Being traumatized is awful, but it usually enables people to grow up faster and sooner.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’d be interested in seeing a deep-dive into the culture of the Silent Generation for a comparison. If the economy is the main issue, then the generation that lived through the Great Depression should hold the most answers, right? A quick google search characterized the Silent Generation as traditional, modest, hardworking, rigid, and eager to build a better world. There are some differences there, and it would be interesting to explore.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: maybe the TrueScent ad is actually a hint towards the answer. the terror of choice. when everything is possible, nothing feels satisfying enough. before, it was 1 or 2, max 3 life scenarios. mostly fail-proof. everyone believed themselves to be happy even if they were just okay. today, we have the whole world at our feet because of the globalisation and its vascular system: the Internet.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Some of this may be true for many people. I myself suffer from anxiety, and this is the anxiety generation. However, I am an ambitious person who has a degree from a very good university and I work full time. I still don’t have the finances to live independently at 25. I have to consider moving to a cheaper state despite loving where I live so much. I did everything I was supposed to do to be “successful” but the world just isn’t the same as it used to be and we are the first generation who has to figure this new world out
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 31:37 way to real, down to the probiotic yogurt
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im 27 and still living with my parents. I worked three jobs through college, currently work full time and make a bit more than the average person my age, and Im still living paycheck to paycheck while paying for my phone, car, health insurance, food, and student loans (and those alone are about $900/month for me). I'd love to live independently, but I'd have to sacrifice all my free time to work to do it and still end up living paycheck to paycheck
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Graduated in May, and ever since my life has been going down. Still applying for full-time jobs, which they all rejected/ghosted me since I need "more experience", but how can I get more experience if I cannot get a job? I'm currently working part-time at a retail to pay my $300 monthly car payment my parents gave me because how the fuck I can go anywhere without a car especially in a place with bad public transportation? I cannot even do any hobbies, meet new friends or just enjoy life in general because the only thing I'm constantly doing is paying my monthly bills to survive. It sucks to be a Gen Z. Graduated during a pandemic and now during the worst job market ever.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm in favor of not having children. (I'm one of those people who never wants to have them), but I feel that in some cases, starting a family was a motivator, or at least a driving force that forced you to wake up every day and give your life direction, even if you weren't entirely sure about anything. Having a child forced you to put up with a job you didn't like, to do adult things you didn't like, and to take on responsibilities you didn't want, but people still put up with it because it was at stake for the well-being of a life you brought into the world. I'm not saying it has to be this way for everyone, there are parents who were always miserable, even with children, and they passed on their own frustrations to those generations. But people who have no direction and went to school, college, and now to work their whole lives without motivation just because it was what their parents and society told them they had to do, in those cases I often see that a child usually gives theem the motivation they need it. On the other hand, starting a family also force you to leave your parent's home and either by choice, because life at home with two families became unsustainable due to clashing ideas, or because their parents kicked them and out of the house, which also hits you with a reality check where you have to survive on what you have, there's no time to look for a dream job, you just take what you can afford and hold on to it to meet your obligations. I'm not saying this is the ideal path, but the truth is none of them are; some things work for some people and not for others.   To get to the end of the road you have to understand that you can't always have what you want (if not most if the time) you just have to make lemonade with the limón you have, adapt and keep moving.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This generation suffers from the effects of the hands off parents who left us to figure things out alone. Didn’t prepare them to be adults which is why we have stunted growth in many aspects of life
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The complaint about the economy isn’t exactly valid.. When I was 20 I had a studio apt, I made $7 an hour and my pay check was around 250ish. My rent was 450, so it was most of my income and I still had to pay the electric. It sucked, I was broke, had no car, etc.. But I got through it and steadily improved my life. It was still some of the best time of my life because it was the first time I lived on my own with no roommates and began my adult life.  It’s always going to be expensive, no matter what. Just in different ways.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: leaving the family home is a big white American culture thing. Not every family here buys into that bc other races/cultures have different familial expectations (good or bad, whatever, moving out isn't as big a deal to some bc they are expected to care for the older members of the family still in the house). And now white Americans can't afford to move out either.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes its the economy but its also isolation and loneliness imo which makes people more unmotivated than realizing they need 5 roommates. Most don’t have 5 friends in their same city they can live with.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: besides the economic and political issues that play a monumental role in all this, which I have seen others bring up in the comments, I think a major thing that was kind of missed here is just a shift in mindset of when we "should have things figured out". For me and a lot of my friends, I think we have come to the realization of: why is 30 the magic number for everyone to settle down into their one and only lifestyle? If people keep living longer, life sucks for everyone anyways, and older generations also have no idea whats going on, then why should I think about 30 as the cutoff point for living a life I enjoy? I think there is a huge shift of when we all feel pressure to "settle down" if we feel it at all (because more and more of us don't really want a family anyways). Its less about not being driven to do things with our lives or to not care about being successful but realizing that 30 isn't where our lives magically stop changing/evolving. And also realizing that success looks different for everyone. I think this is something that was pressed a lot with older generations that has been loosening over time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They watched millennials work their butts off and still fail. Why should gen z bother?

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Holy f*** with the tiktoks....and I thougth my MIND  was hell.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Edit: I wrote this… rambling comment when I wasn’t even 5 minutes in, so I’ve probably repeated a lot of what the OP has presented  Every generation has always had a few folks with “Peter Pan” syndrome. Heck, I’m 41 and I still don’t want to fully adult, yet  Honestly, I think the more people with this syndrome there are in a generation, the “easier” their lives have been during their childhoods. And, what I mean by “easy” is that they didn’t have to face a depression/homelessness/starvation, live in a warzone, work in the mines, come face-to-face with plague bodies in the streets, etc., on a mass scale  Essentially, their childhoods were good, they felt protected,  safe, and they don’t want to fully let go and face the cold, indifferent, and merciless “real world.” Honestly, I don’t blame them, it’s awful out here  I also think that some people have a “failure to launch” because the environment they grew up in was scary. Traumatic, even. Now, They’re faced with choices that go against what’s comfortable  Take not driving, as an example. Young people grew up hearing about the dangers of climate change/pollution and how they have to be a part of the solution and do their part. They might have conflicting feelings about driving because the environmental damage they cause goes against what they’ve been taught is “right,” and to not be a polluter. I dunno, I’m just typing tangentially at this point..  However, this intimidating world has been created by us humans. We’ve let the psychopaths take the wheel and there’s no one else but ourselves to blame. But, I digress  As a nurse who works primarily with senior citizens, my advice is to never fully grow up  The happiest and healthiest “old people” that I’ve met still hold on to that silliness, creativeness, playfulness, and curiosity of youth to some degree. Interestingly, out of all the people I’ve asked about how they feel mentally, the vast majority have said that although their bodies get old, mentally they’ve always felt to be 25 years old.   But, how to balance that out with being able to survive and thrive in our current capitalist dystopia is beyond me as even I struggle with that. Talk therapy works for me. As does the medication. Best of luck! :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And now we have to worry about AI taking over everyhing😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m like this cause the older generation people abused me then left me to fend for myself. It’s like y’all raised me to be dependent on you to have a sense of self, then boom, suddenly everything is up to me and I have to figure out what will make me want to live in a world that is so damaged and scary. The world is getting worse every day and if there’s only a few more years to live, I’d rather live those years in my own comfort rather than trying to “build for the next generation” that I fear will not exist.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This will get worse and worse until we all die out.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't know if Japan actually does this, or if it's just something I've seen in video games and anime; but "work studies" should really be a thing here. It's the concept of letting middle and high-schoolers actually experience working needed jobs (probably trade jobs) under the supervision of the teacher and the people who work at said jobs.  So for example, if we needed construction workers; we'd take them to a construction site, or perhaps a mock construction site (for obvious reasons) and then let them experience all the different jobs they could do on a construction site. Maybe you do this for a few days, or a week; so that everyone can try everything, and then you move on to the next work study. Connections, experience; confidence, work studies could provide all those.  Or at least, that's what I would say; if AI wasn't going to take over everything. UBI now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z/Gen Alpha spent so much of their core development time locked indoors with other people, they never learned how to effectively mask their autism. They are generations that want and expect honesty and sincerity, but all they get are people who want to tell them they're doing it wrong. So, the best they'll learn how to do, like most people with AuDHD in roles they're not especially suited for, is "fake it and hold on and hope the pain stops". Maybe instead of saying "people are assholes, the world is unfair, deal with it", society as a whole should look at how to reshape itself to not be full of unfair assholes.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You have the stats but not the why
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I love this video’s pivot to therapy! Fascinating and your videos are always so surprising and informative. I think extending “emerging adulthood” to 29 y.o. is stupid. You’re are a full blown adult at 29 and that’s just a fact. Adulthood isn’t cookie-cutter, it isn’t pre-ordained. It’s just a messy mess.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ha ha yea I am 33 and still live at home.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was gonna leave a very ranty comment but decided against it cause I don't think there's anything I can say that like 10 people haven't already addressed. I appreciate you highlighting how overprotective parenting plays a big role in stunted independence because Lord knows I had that. I will also point out that the have kind of brought the backlash on yourself with this one cause the video title and open are very rage bait esq. There are also many things included into the video like the point about young people not having stable jobs or having kids that is like "yeah? We're in a global recession??" half of my friends who work have been laid off due to company restructures in the last year, I know a few people who have had to move back in with their parents even though they really want kids so like, what do you want us to do? I also feel like people's perception of Gen Z is heavily influenced by social media and not actually by the people they know, half the things Gen Z says on their social media is things previous generations went through, they just didn't voice it all so publicly and personally I don't think it's a bad thing. I do think you were trying to be motivational, but it came off more as criticism I think which is unfortunate but it happens. Sometimes the message you were trying to convey isn't what comes across, you're also only human and I think people need to give YOU more grace than they are. Sorry
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this is a long tangent that is just a line of thought more than anything. it is an exception from the rule, but i thought it is interesting how this phenomenon is also present in eastern europe, but in different childhood n adolescence environments. if it’s too much to read, the last paragraph is more than enough to get the point im making (or u can just ignore my comment, to whoever might read this lol).  9:40 i think this is a factor for sure, however it isn’t universal. for instance, i live in the balkans n my mom is a late boomer/very early gen x n my dad is an average gen x (although generation stereotypes aren’t very applicable here, only a few characteristics, due to how different boomers n gen x ppl grew up here during communism compared to the west n especially the u.s). most balkan parents want their kids to have more opportunities than they did (i think its similar to how first generation u.s immigrants approach raising their kids) n end up pressuring us during our time in school, including (especially) college. while there are parents who can be suffocating in how they press u ab where u are or list all the horrible things that could happen to u, they still don’t coddle u in a soft way. like they care ab ur safety but u still have to use the bus. they are the balkan stereotype of parents who rarely hug u (if at all in some cases), think that “i love u” doesn’t need to be said because it’s a general fact, even tho they never act like it n never apologize (cuz ur not a real person with autonomy under their roof, so, if anything, u gotta apologize for their mistakes, because they sacrificed sm for u). here basic necessities like a home, food, hygiene products etc. aren’t basic, they are still seen as effort on the parent’s part, like to most of us even personal space can be a privilege. also, most ppl my age (20) were very much exposed to shitty family situations or outright some form of abuse from their parents (mostly verbal with the usual narcissistic adjacent manipulative talk n the unshakable power dynamics, but there certainly was some physical abuse as well in varying degrees, depending on the case), especially when studying or failing in school. this is so ingrained in our culture that its a meme that you, as a kid, would be crying over a math book at like 12 am or even later while ur parent yells that ur dumb for the nth time (not gonna include the physical side of things, but it is a stereotype).   this whole block of text is just to say that we (balkan gen z ppl) were raised in a similar way to how western gen x’ers or second generation u.s immigrants were, n yet we find ourselves in the same predicament, with a layer of pessimism added due to the area we live in (which usually consists of asphalt, 50s-80s commie blocks, fog during autumn n winter + industrial fumes if ur lucky to live in the industrial side of town etc) n due to the way things are going. our elections (across multiple countries) were meddled with by russia, the ukraine-russian war is very close to us especially when it comes to countries that aren’t in nato or the eu, prices are so high n salaries are so low all the while young ppl aren’t being hired because of a lack of experience that they are supposed to gain by being hired 💀 n the west isn’t an option anymore (up until 2020-ish we all had an uncharacteristic optimism regarding our own country’s progress or potential prosperity n if that didn’t work out for us, then we would always have better options in central-western europe, since the u.s has lost its appeal after trump’s first presidency). however, that’s changed drastically, the far right is very much present in the west (even more so than here) n our far right is also sponsored by, once again, russia.   so, while parenting is a logical factor, especially in the u.s n western europe, i think that it has more to do with the current state of the world n with the fact that we have had this, in a way, idealized view of how our teenage n young adult years will be like from seeing it in older millennials, only for the rug to be pulled from under our feet. i mean, gen z of all ages were in critical moments of their lives when covid hit, some were graduating, some were starting college n some were starting high school (all pretty important developmental milestones that were put on pause n i would say put us on pause). i was 15 when covid really hit in my country n ever since then i haven’t had a concrete sense of my age n stage in life anymore, like i have been cruising through life absentmindedly n passively. i can say for certain that i genuinely n wholeheartedly mean it when i say that i can’t believe im 20, cuz it honestly feels so foreign, not in the sense that “oh i feel so old 😝😜🤪” but in the sense that i still kinda subconsciously expect my teenage years to “start” cuz adolescence never quite felt like teenage-hood, it honestly didn’t feel like anything cuz i wasn’t fully there, if it makes sense. post-covid years, at least in my case n most of my friends’, were years of yearning n waiting for the stage we were entering before the pandemic to begin, without realizing we were in it. an analogy for comprehensions sake: it’s like getting stuck with a job u don’t like while telling urself that one day u’ll quit to pursue ur dreams, only for another week of agony n monotony to pass, while hoping for ur dreams, but not realizing u are wasting urself away in inaction n passiveness.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I never want to have children and yet sometimes I still can help but feel behind in life when I reached the age 24-25 when my parents gave birth to me and had a cheap apartment with a dog. So many things I could or want to do with my life and yet money-problems and societal oppression seem to be glaring down at me. Society is forcing kids to grow up too fast with the too much time they're forced to spend in school creating a coddled generation while at the same time infantilizing when they're supposed to want to grow independent from their primary caretaker as soon as possible without problem because independence is ultimately more important than always needing someone to help you with basic issues, many years ago 16 years was still old enough for a man to go to war and nowadays too many people wait untill their thirties to have children.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: After watching, I think these young adults need a fun activity that teaches them critical thinking, math, making decisions, and seeing what consequences come from their decision. What activity can help young adults do this? ...Dungeon & Dragons...  They get to practice make decisions and learning with the consequences with those decisions, they learn math, and how to communicate better.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The healthy gamer has a nice video talking about this, from a medical point of view.  https://www.youtube.com/live/bMa9dAYdTE0
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Seeing the stark contrast from US to EU or rather Denmark now days is insane. Much has not changed here. People still get kids at the age of 22-25, getting married has been going up in rate. It’s certainly interesting to see the difference. One of the issues with growing up for some of us here where we’re seen as “slow” is often due to more mental health issues then anything else. Personally I suffer from depression issues, meds barely works and this is sadly just permanent. This makes it hard to get stuff done. I suspect this is the same issues for a major part of the US at this point. Mental health has been left behind. Not allowing kids to grow up and make mistakes will create some mental health issues later on in life. Life can sucks, hurt and be anything but fun. But that is just part of it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Something I’ve noticed in gen z is the lack of being willing to have roommates; they would rather live at home rent free than finding a 3 bedroom apartment with 2 roommates. However, that was a very normal step for millennials to take post highschool/college (at least where I live). But I don’t know any gen z that is doing that; the ones I know either married straight out of high school or they are 23/24 still living at home with no plan of moving out. I see a serious lack of independence in the gen z group but there’s flaws in every generational group.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was born in 88, but I'm in the same hole. I have a carreer since 2015 but Time went too fast and I don't feel more mature or wealthier than Zoomers. A think is a global crisis.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The failure to launch/peter pan syndrome is a thing across every generation. It’s just well, previous generations it wasn’t well documented till Gen Z, because they are chronically online, which allow anthropology and psychology field to study this better & figure out what is going on & why.  Anyway….  Gen Z never had a swift proverbial kick in the pants like previous generations where as soon as you hit 16, not 18, 16 & unless you came from a wealthy family, you got a summer job or a job on the weekends to afford your teenage lifestyle.  Previous generations also WANTED part time jobs, wanted independence, actually sought out ways to even graduate soon  to get out of the house faster!   Gen Z? They were so bubble wrapped by their parents or lack serious supervision due to parents having more than one job, they either are split into two groups: The anxiety induced and the hyper independent. The former, is what you’re seeing in the video. The latter is a way smaller group and usually have baby boomer parents or millennial older siblings. The latter group is actually thriving in adulthood as Gen Z’ers, these are the ones who I notice aren’t addicted to their phones, who are more social, who have made a lot of milestones in their 20’s.   That former group of Gen Z? One thing I’ll advise, they gotta stop being afraid to make errors, failures, and mistakes. They gotta stop being afraid of rejection. And lastly, they gotta stop being shopaholics with materialism with eyes bigger than their stomachs, but like acting as though their wallets are fat with billions but are pay as you go plans (ie Klarna, AfterPay, Affirm, Shopify, etc…) with a dusty savings account that’s collecting spiderwebs! Sorry, but if you can’t afford anything but rent, bills, and grocery right now? Do not keep splurging on every impulse to self soothe the anxiety of finances, that’s how shopping addiction and spending addictions that get people into $50,000 to $200,000 in debt eventually!   But I digress, Generation Z, the ones with anxiety are needing to break though and just try.   As they say, it’s better to try than live with regrets!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I really appreciate the effort it must have taken you to not pronounce it "zed"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh so genz is adapting the ancient asian way now. Makes sense.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey! Gen z starts in 1996/1997. That's 28/30 year olds. Let's loop our late twenties adults too! I love no social media. Left it two years ago and now their is no existential crisis anymore. IDGF about what other people are doing because I don't know what they're doing. Cut out the noise and life gets better.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I laughed on the inside when I saw the statistic that move Gen Zers don't drive, like yeah, I'd be surprised if the average family could just through 10,000-30,000 USD just to make sure their kids could go to their part time job. I straight up got rudly rejecting because of that "Get a car, then we can talk" The candy store employee said to the high schooler. Hope she got a hot sugar burn :P Just that one thing sets us back significantly.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This only applies to people who have parents that will support them. For us Gen Z who are alone we are working every day and paying our own way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z here!😁👋 My parents let me get my own job as soon as I could (a referee gig at 14) so I could get a taste of independence. My mom also deeply believes in unstructured play time and help only when you ask for it (btw me and my sisters go to a charter school). I think that all parents should do stuff like this…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: From my experience having roommates in a big city, they’re very much hit or miss. My last roommate was incredibly abusive and I had to move out because I just couldn’t be around him anymore. I think me and lots of folks in my generation just want to save enough money to live alone and have some semblance of peace and sanity.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It was shown that things are literally almost unaffordable. I'll admit, I'm definitely somewhat addicted to technology, but I still have responsibility for things. I'm social, and usually driven by the anxiety and not suppressed by it. I do agree, some people really need to get help in that sense, but some of us are genuinely trying.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Older gen z here (1998). I got my driving licence in 2016, when I was 18. In Italy we have some restrictions about the type of car you can drive in the first year of your driving licence, so I couldn't drive my parent's cars. I didn't have the money to buy a used car so I didn't. In 2017 I moved to another city and I never went back. Now I am doing my phd (yeah, still in uni), and I need a car for conducting fieldwork. So I am forced to buy one. A decent used car costs at least 5000 euros, not including insurance (1000 euros) and other mandatory expenses. My salary as a phd is 1100/month, which is not bad (there are uni which pay wayyy less). So you tell me how I can afford to buy a car, since it will require six of my paychecks. And I still need to pay the rent, grocery, utilities, and so on. You tell me how we can afford anything.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Having fewer children usually means that parents pay more attention to them. However, Gen Z parents often worry a lot about their children's mistakes. Social media sets high standards that can be hard to reach. Even though these parents may not yell, it's not gentle parenting
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am 25 so the upwards end of Gen Z, I would disagree with your assessment. The millennials have Peter Pan syndrome while I have noticed Gen Z watching them and surging past them (getting married, having kids etc)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The best thing Gen Z can do is aggressively pursue the trades. Electricians, plumbers, auto mechanics, health care workers, etc. are all in hot demand and will continue to be. So much of this comes from the college pipeline that left young adults with no employable skills and a boatload of debt. I went to high school in a small southern town and the kids who went to trade school don’t have these problems. Those are the only people I know who owned houses before 30. Meanwhile my friends from university are still in school seven years later so they could defer their loan payments.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They're unhappy because they can't see themselves outside the lens of their own cameras. Delete the board-of-investor-controlled social media apps. Find something that ignites your passion and curiosity, work hard for a few years to master a skill or expertise, and try to focus.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why are previous generations so eager for us to fail? It’s not coddling. It’s looking at our parents, at previous generations mistakes and saying “well I’m not gonna do that then”. Hence not getting married, not having kids. Why doesn’t gen z want to own anything? We can’t afford anything. Can’t afford a house or car. So what is it? Take time to make my own decisions? Or follow my parent’s or society’s decisions? The age at which people meet these goals are socially constructed. And wow ! Look at that high divorce rate, it’s almost as if half the time the decision to get married is a bad idea! The issue of previous generations is that they actually DIDNT make their own decisions, they just went along with what everyone else did and our generation is able to look at their mistakes and be better informed. This weird infantilization of gen z is so misleading. Most of the issues stem from a shit economy and lack of a possible future. As for lack of drive, I have a fuck ton of it that I put into personal projects that keep me happy. That’s all I want to be. I don’t want to b some corporate cog who’s eventually replaced my AI. Sure, go to college, get in debt, just to be replaced by AI. Times are different, the world is accelerating exponentially. We can’t keep up, forgive us for taking an extra few years to make an informed decision while sea levels rise and forests burn.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: youre 1995 and have a child?? im 1996 and thats crazy to me...Probably proves the point of the video
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I still don't have my license at 19. It's not a lack of drive or motivation for me. My parents never put me in Drivers Ed, so I paid for Aceable myself at 18. But, I was never able to obtain the physical permit bc they will not drive me to the DMV! There's not even an accessible bus route to the nearest DMV, which is in another town. Many Gen Z live in car-centric cities with apathetic parents. It's tough figuring out how to "adult" when you have no support system.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: AI also plays a part. The fear of your job being taken over by AI is a real reality that is already happening. It's this overwhelming knowledge of knowing that AI is starting to take over human jobs which can affect motivation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 27:57 this is not a unique gen z experience. I think this is just growing up. Or at the very least, this includes millennials too. Because we were also told we could be anything, and I remember growing up and learning how that just isn't true. But then you learn disappointment is a part of life, and you have to find joy in what you can do and what you do have. And then you become ok.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Having an entire existential crisis in your late 20s is a right of passage and while things don't necessarily get better by 30 you will get better at dealing. As for "ugh these damn teens & young adults just won't grow up" that's just a natural outcome of the shit economy that we've all grown up in since the 70s that never really got better.  The elders will stop ragging on you about "how little you've achieved" once the next generation is old enough to flounder in capitalist hell with the rest of us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am a millenial (1993) and I can also happily confirm I have no clue of what I am doing and feel like a child that has to do taxes
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No. Drinking is NOT a milestone! That's an addiction.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z is the generation in which discipline was taken out of the homes and schools.  It's also the generation where technology blew up. This is the generation where kids stopped playing outside and started being glued to screens. So start there. And they are now raising  or lack thereof the WORST generation known to mankind. This didn't start with covid or the economy it's been building since the mid to late 90s.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There may be an economic undercurrent to all this. My friends are in the same situation as me, but we are all from low-income households. My parents are severely in debt. The most "independent" people I know have upper middle-class parents who pay for their lifestyle.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the earth is dying, the people at war with themselves and each other, the economy is terrible, we are speeding up mindsets and burnouts common usually half way through life, now had at 20s. the internet feeds us all of this information and regurgitates everything we are trying to run towards and away from. it’s a cycle of mental and physical exhaustion. it’s a trap and we know it, all of this and people want us to think about a future that is no longer certain- we may not die tomorrow but it feels like that possibility is more real than finding our place in the world
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think there are a multitude of reasons, I’m 29 and was heavily pushed to go to college, many of us had student loans for degrees we may or may not want. We want to work but starting a career at 24/25 because we never had any work experience outside of retail or service jobs, means the only jobs we qualify for are entry level professional jobs usually. So you have $75,000 in student loans making $45,000 a year, thinking I’ll pay it off in two years not factoring in taxes and just living expenses. So you drag that on, everyone on social media is getting new cars, vacations, and engaged. You think these things will happen and then you’re 27 and realize you’re almost a decade behind where everyone in your family was growing up. I think a lot of Gen Z were sold a promise that was never delivered; I truly think most Gen Z want marriage, kids, a house, and a decent job; it just feels so unattainable and out of reach
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: A little off topic but as a background I'm 97 so older gen z/zillenial and I've been thinking that I wish I was born earlier as a millennial. And now as gen alpha kids having their issues, they probably rather have been born as gen z. But maybe now with the next gen after gen alpha, it is actually better to be born as gen beta than alpha. I hope at least some of the social media and AI things have been manager by the time those born now get to school age. I live in Finland so kid here have been getting phones even earlier than in many other countries, due to the history of Nokia leading the industry, and kids use for example whatsapp to chat with their friends. But now Whatsapp has become a social media too and they can actually watch youtube unrestricted via whatsapp for example. The age limits of social media aren't taken seriously and I really hope soon it will. At least recently in age group 6-9 phone-watches without internet has become more popular, so some change is happening already.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the world gen z inherited is so rigged against them, no wonder they're lost
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah no it’s the systems fault tbh. There isn’t anything wrong with “not growing up?”  Also driving is such a car-centric idea in the first place!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I would like to say that people don’t get their licenses in hs because there’s no point regulations have gotten a lot more strict with curfews and not allowing friends to drive with them until late 17 or even 18
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Difficult to make any decision when the outside opinions telling it's a bad decision are so numerous or at least feel like it. maybe it's a growing up with the internet thing but the motto is : make smart decisions but trust no one. You can't go anywhere when there is too much information to process but trusting people is a risk. It's not hard to imagine why people were happier when nobody had a clue or that your three choices of careers were baker, carpenter or accountant idk. I don't know if it's a genZ thing, my gen X parents were telling me I was entitled a few years ago and now they are like, yeah sorry the world is nonsense now, because the whole meritocracy tale is just crumbling.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When I can't choose between things I do eeny meeny miny moe, and then if I'm disappointed with the outcome, clearly I want the other option.  If there's more than two you just keep eliminating like this until you feel excited. When it comes to a job if you never feel excited the problem might just be capitalism.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How independent I want my children to be and how early I want them to be independent is something I have given a lot of thought to. I don't want her to live her life coddled like I was. I want her to be able to solve her own problems without any intervention as early as possible. Even in toddlerhood, I won't help when she's frustrated unless she asks for help, because I want  her to increase her frustration tolerance, although, sometimes I'll give her verbal comfort and encouragement, but that's it. However, I don't think I'll ever feel safe letting her walk around by herself as a child, until something here changes. Where I live in a place where demographics that have a track record of victimizing young girls is rapidly increasing, and those in authority are giving increasingly lax consequences to those who do so. Women who post mean tweets are getting more jail time than those who SA children. That being said, I'll likely have her go out short distances with a group of friends, particularly if that includes older friends, or trusted adults. Strength in numbers.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: its the bleakness of the economy and our future... opoortunities that were vastly available to our parents just arent available to us, even something supposedly simple as getting a decent job after already working hard for a degree feels unattainable. How are we supposed to pursue other shit or grow up when we cant even see hope for our future? Our parents could work some regular office job for two years buy a beautiful spacious home get married go on vacations raise kids never having to worry about bills on a median salary. Something like that's a dream for gen zs now and many of us probably wont be able to afford a home until we die. This is the same nihilist hopelessness the japanese faced during their lost decade. When people cant see hope cant see a future for them they lose the motivation to work since its all useless,  just that simple
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: All is true I work with two 20 year olds and act like teens. Not even thinking about moving out from their parents house and try having independence.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠​⁠ i feel you that those aspects were your focus for this video, however, its all connected, diabolically intertwined even, sadly, regrettably,  imagine if it weren’t ?!? 👀 🎉 but i digress,   most of what the video focuses on is secondary, or even tertiary, look at it this way, economic based milestones as u put, also have social and more importantly emotional impacts, say you’re the only one who hasn’t gotten a license because no one has an extra boat to practice in, or money for driving lessons w/mrs puff, and you gotta ask for rides everywhere or use your chevrolegs, or find bus and light rail routes which still require gas $ to bus pass pimp na mean?

But lets zoom out a bit, forgive me for putting in the details as i imagine them lol but okay from any lens yo, rational, logical, hell even number crunching, budgeting conscious, accounting class nerd type, unbiased analysis of, we might be fqked, it to take a very long time, lotta lotta cash/credit/debt, everything that economic based milestones NOW require (like anything and everything else now REALLY) and, still, 1 job two jobs, schooling, three jobs/side gigs that also become main gigs cuz still take time money energy and effort to do and recover from instead of rest or relaxation, and one could say with certainty even acknowledging that some or all economic milestones may not EVER be achieved, and if one has done that, has crunched the number, wrote it down, thought it out, and see, see it for what it is, that its not as CRAZY as maybe we friggin hoped it would be, because it IS crazy…it’s insane how uncrazy it is…  that that may very well be the case, for a lot of us, regardless of generation regardless of, anything else really, we’re more alike than not, even the 1% has ITS 1% ! Imagine ?!?! We have more in common and take any look see, its not looking good, by anyb measure, any analysis, any aspect of life today, here or anywhere, and the rest makes sense, iced coffeees & avocado toast anyone? =‘] it doesn’t cost a mortgage or rent and im way more sure about qualifying for 1 and no wait, get them today ! 🎉 🥳 🧊 ☕️ 🥑 🍞🥹🫠👍  (from conspiracy theory to conspiracy fact, or, you know, regular conspiracy (meaning true/real, a real plan, a scheme that occurred or is occurring)  because 2 or more people conspiring IS by def a conspiracy, where 2 or more parties plan or agree to do something USUALLY in a nefarious manner and usually for personal [corporate, special interest, lobby, gov, organized religion/education/media etc] gain, at everyone else’s expense, again, its crazy how NOT crazy it is, and because they’ve been doing it for so long, and efforts, MASSSIVE efforts to “ill make it legal” - sith, they kind of dont even really need to hide it, and sometimes like one of my fav movies The Big Short, why would they confess? Theyre not confessing, theyre bragging ! (The Other Guys, mark walberg and will ferrel touches on that too, wall st and corporate corruption and coverup and hijinks too!)  For anyone thats interested a good place to start is endless currency debasement with the Federal Reserve™️ Act of 1913, titanic, list of remaining countries WITHOUT Rothschild controlled banks (yet), and “The Collapse of The American Dream Explained in Animation” here on YouTube, i think its by doctordude https://youtu.be/mII9NZ8MMVM?si=ZanjQUInNu_eNjzL ? 🤷 that one’s good, and goldandsilvers’s “The Biggest Scam of History of Mankind - Hidden Secrets of Money Ep4, https://youtu.be/iFDe5kUUyT0?si=E85TDimbJW-LBEwl is also a doozy, and, painfully true. Just be ready, and it can be confusing, and thats on purpose. (Spoiler alert, the Federal Reserve™️ isnt federal and has no reserves…what a name eh? See: fda,fbi,epa,cps,cdc, damn near all of em…a lot of what it is, or i guess ISNT, is in the name, and thats by design too, think Totally Legit Enterprises LLC, lol (this was my response to the pinned comment by the vid publisher, copy pasted this from there to here as a regular comment feel free to reply to either 🤷 hope you’re all doin alright, even if you’re not, thats ok 2 =‘], dont get me started on ghost jobs/ghosting, but yeah endless debasement of debt based currency, yikes yo, peace)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm tired of rich people telling me that I'm not doing X or Y. It'd be easier if I was as wealthy as you. STFU.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You guys didn't watch the last portion of the video, did you?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just want to say as a very traditional Catholic woman, I see a lot of young people joining the Church at levels I am very surprised by. I think that many people my age crave structure and certainty, which isn't provided really by anything save for a more stringent, structured social institution like the Church. Clearly I'm happy about this, but I do worry it's not a real commitment and just a desperate yearning for structure. The world used to be a lot more clear and certain.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sending kids to grow up in day care centers and being i  the presence of non family members  gets in the way of daddy passing on all if his knowledge  and mommy doing the same. Often people realize we are the same family. Parents are the child's permanent teacher. School shuffles teachers around. I feel parents are spending less time and the children don't reflect their parents or family's personalities and character.  The family's religious, cultural, and lifestyle is lost and the media attention develops the child into a different person separate from the family.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Late 20s gen-z here who has been in a ton of therapy, so this response will be a little biased.  I think there are a few nuances missing from this take. For the first time in history, women are able to have careers, go to college, and be more independent than our mothers and grandparents. Even my mother, was raised very differently to always put men first and that marriage was the end all be all. We've grown up having many of these injustices highlighted to us from a young age, as they should be. Who decides the marker of "Adulthood" and being successful comes from relationships, drinking, driving, working the same career for 40 years, etc? I'm sure there are boomers who experienced the same thing, delayed license, relationships, etc, in their youth.  I have millennial friends in their 30s who never got a license and I have peers in my masters program who are 23 and have accomplished far more than I could ever imagine at their age.  I don't think it is that we don't want to grow up, but maybe being "grown" looks different for  us now. We are also the first generation to be able to express these complex feelings online, which may just give more attention to things that previous generations left internally. I don't consider a relationship or the age you start drinking as signs of being "grown". I much more value someone's ability to think for themselves, show up as a reliable person when needed, and behave in mature ways. Even if this maturity causes someone to live at home with their parents longer while they save money, go to college, etc.  I also don't fully agree with your point about therapy. I do see what you mean that sometimes in talk therapy we get stuck in this cycle of confirming wounds we have, but i don't think being in therapy for your life is wrong, either. With so much being thrown at us from the internet and the isolation we are seeing in this generation (which i feel again is largely unique), I do not care if someone is in therapy forever and I will not look down on them for that.   I have both ptsd and ocd and will likely be in long term therapy. Even if I were to feel ready to leave, I will be dealing with these symptoms for the rest of my life. I do take breaks and switch therapists, but this idea therapy is leading to us infantilizing ourselves is a bad take, imo. Psychology and Neuroscience are still such new fields that we don't really know anything about. Who knows, maybe in ten years we will find that everything we have done doesn't work or it does?    I also personally do not agree with the term Peter Pan syndrome. This, to me, is a largely outdated term that was used while we did not have the correct terms for other mental issues nor a society that had any leeway for people who's brains work differently. We now accept accommodations, rather than trying to strong-arm someone into acting how everyone is "supposed" to act. I also do not think it is fair to place blame or shame on someone who may be "stunted" for whatever reason.   I do not want to base my success and how far I get in life on the standards of previous generations, especially ones that are rooted deeply in colonialism, white supremacy, and the patriarchy (like being married so young or not living with your family as an adult). I think we have a lot to come to continue to decenter and break down the systems of oppression we grew up on and to unlearn these lessons we were raised on (and our parents and their parents were raised on). Why do I need to be defined by the "American dream"? What if I have no desire to ever live in the white picket fenced house in the little suburban home with my nuclear family? Other cultures often have many family members living in the same home for decades and our elderly were not as abandoned or alone.   While the internet may see us as a group of people who do not want to grow up, I see us as having all the opportunity in the world to figure out who we are. We are getting to take more time and be more patient with ourselves, than other generations were able to (and maybe this is why they are so bigoted and angry). My parents were married with a house and children by my age, but never left the country or really traveled outside of my home state. I have traveled to many continents and if I want to up and fly to Ireland tomorrow I could (granted I do have some responsibilities I would have to arrange first). I think that is really beautiful. My grandmother was a stay at home mom by the age of 19 and I'm not sure what her youth looked like. She has sense passed, but I wish I knew more about what she wanted to be as a child and what her dreams were like.  Maybe instead of being a generation who's worth is based on the way others see us, it is based on how far we grow internally? Maybe the definition of adulthood and its respective milestones needs to be changed?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Most gen z understand that their best hope is to have a job and still be relatively homeless.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I dunno, I'm not genz and all my friends are not Gen z. We also don't know what we're doing with our lives. Even when someone is making fat cash from their career, they are confused half the time lol. When it comes to moving out... It's too expensive now. Also, in my culture (Chinese) we don't move out until we are married... So no point in worrying lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I honestly feel that most of these people in the Tiktoks are thinking way too much about themselves. Try expending some time outside your head and your phone, it will feel better.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im 23 and I have an apt and a pretty good job ive been called gen z alot idk if I am but most people i know my age have their stuff together so maybe this not wanting to grow up is a internet thing? (Edit: i do have some debt but thats because i spent 3 years partying in spain it was MY fault not the worlds but yeah debt does suck buns)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same thing happened to most zillennials & millennials. The economic state & lack of opportunities
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I believe the Covid 19 pandemic haa a huge effect on gen z growing up. Covid hit spring break my senior year of high school and we never went back to high school and my entire college experiences was online so many of my peers never got to both experience closure from high school but as well as truly emotionally grow after because of all the time we were forced inside. This is just one factor I believe
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Too many of us have been sold the fantasy that "normal" means being genuinely happy most of the time. People need to fix their contentment gauges, because if you think a good life must include the perfect job house ECT ECT you are setting yourself up for failure at this point. Golden age of America (specifically) is gone.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im a millenial and im a peter pan too, but that's because i have adhd
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: pacomio campos-cano is a predator. Crime is still happening. My daughter was abducted and SA in 2024 by a stranger less than a mile from our home. It wasn't broadcast all over the news or anything. Thankfully she was able to escape. But pacomio campos-cano was on $0 bail for SA a few months prior. Its still happening they are just not showcasing it. The school woudnt even send anything out even though his home was directly across the street and kids were walking past daily.   You never think it will be your kid.  We lived in Rochester, mn for cancer care. But the truth is, its still happening they shut down a sex trafficking ring 4 days after his arrest and arrested 11 more men. We will never know if it was related but to know I was so close to never seeing my baby girl makes me want to hold her even closer. Now trying to give freedom as shes a teen is so hard but I have to for her well being.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am unemployed for 7 years divorced can't drive depressed have severe anxiety and depression afraid to even apply for jobs i don't even care anymore this world is so meterealistic i have trouble doing simple things  already 30 its like if your  not successful as a man specially your a walking dead body enough is enough plase for God's sake i play video games to cope with reality
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a member of Gen X, I will say that I can understand. I think one of the biggest differences is that we were not only really taking care of ourselves when we were literal kids, but we. wanted to move out and get our freedom as fast as we could. We generally have roommates that type of thing. But one thing that we were not, we were not resilient either the slackers us, at least that’s what they called us us, we are in our 40s and 50s now and we still refuse to grow up .  but we do all the adult stuff because that’s the only way to survive in this world if that makes sense. Personally, I’m a fan of GEN-Z and I think that they get black. I think they’ll be just fine like all the rest of us have been. I do feel terrible for them. To have to live in the world the way it is now though. And again we’re still here and I guess if enough of us encourage you guys and quit yelling about how doomed Z is. I really think they’ll grow into whatever it is that they’re meant to do. Just realize that everything doesn’t happen the way we want, however as long as you do what you can that’s the best you can do.  You guys will be fine. Unless something happens like the world blowing up, which is what they always told us was going to happen before we were older. So try to enjoy as much as you can don’t stress about having to stay at home with your parents most of us really don’t mind at all. Especially if you’re trying to find your way. I have a GenZ son by the way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: One thing to consider with a lot of these statistics is covid- yeah, less teenagers where getting licenses in 2021 because it was the middle of the pandemic.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why should young people struggle through pain and mistakes for a future that isn't going to be there? I feel like Gen Z isnt preparing for the future because the only future we can envision is imminent mass death.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It probably also doesn't help that 11-16 years nowadays watch True Crime Podcast show(s) with their parental figures especially if they are off the female sex. Like, I had to admit to myself, even just watching and listening to it from "abroad" (to me) made me more paranoid in Winter time couple years ago than 'd like to admit to myself. I can't imagine what that does to a brain still under construction..like at least I had my Teenage nativity with me going out partying till I was  18 and finally found a best friend for some time 🤣
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like the way this subject was treated is very western society oriented
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Idunno. They said they same thing about Gen X and Gen Y.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1 to 2 or no kids. Great love that for us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i mean you're not necessarily wrong but like i've been applying to jobs for over a year now and i still haven't gotten one that pays me enough to be independent. my friend's brother won a national prize for being an excellent student and even he got rejected from everything he applied to. it's not about resilience when the structures that were there that helped previous generations gain independence with ease are just not there anymore. like what the fuck do you guys want us to do. my friend has a masters degree in law and she's not getting any fucking jobs either. of course we "can't find direction" and "aren't growing up" when we can't earn any fucking money because no one will hire us. i have friends who work at apple and even THEY are strapped for cash and they don't even do anything expensive.  and i can't really get behind the idea that getting support from your family as an adult is some kind of arrested development situation. sorry that our parents didn't leave us to die on the street the second we turned 18? yall can talk about resilience and shit as much as you want but if the economy wasn't completely fucked rn this would not be a problem at all.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is a fun timing after Britain’s just lowered the voting age to 16! So rad that they did that, and people just complain without realizing that this confusion they feel is just a part of adulthood.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't have my license not because I'm not interested in driving I can't drive without a car I can't afford a car no one I know will let me use theirs I have my permit but with no car or money to use I cannot obtain my license.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thinking kids/teens are not having life experiences and challenges is such a lukewarm and out of touch take. Overprotective parents existed in every generation regardless of rate  It’s like when millennials were told off about participation trophies and having access to the internet
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: TLDR version. Gen X, we like to flex about how tough we are and all this. The truth is the world forced us to do certain things, and we have always refused to literally grow up. And the whole trope about men not growing up in the Peter Pan drome kind of crazy because men have always been that way if we look back historically in terms of the United States culture. Superheroes that’s not a new thing, etc. Anyway, I just wanted to throw in my two cents.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No, the difference is y’all could get a fkn job without competing with half the world and ai lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yet we need to look at a lot people spending money “they don’t have”. They go to concerts for thousands of dollars, and buy luxury goods when none of them have savings account or financial security. Then complain about being broke, it’s hilarious! Don’t spend money on pleasure when you don’t even have stability. 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The beginning seems pointless to say because its not like we want to be young or be with our parents in many cases, its that we can't afford to live anywhere else. I refuse to use 90% of my current income to stay in an apartment and then have like 200 a month for food, insurance, gas, and other things I have to buy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is the result of late stage capitalism. I am not Gen Z, but I empathize with their perspective and unwillingness to participate in an inefficient, inhumane, and immoral system.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've been trying to hire an entry level engineer and I'm struggling to find anyone who will actually work more than twenty minutes without checking their phone. They get three hours of work done per day and even that work is subpar because they don't concentrate enough. I'm easy to deal with and don't expect the world, but it would be nice to get the bare minimum of 6 to 8 hrs per day.   It's easy to find a great candidate on paper, but that doesn't mean they are great on the job. I'm not sure, but I think they see people making $500K on crypto in a month and so they think a $100K salary is not enough, especially since it's not enough to buy a house.   I can't ask it, but it would be better if they shut off their phone. I think that phone is destroying their life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Everyone wants to grow up. Everyone wants the power of more choices etc even if it comes with more responsibility. But no one can afford to gain any economic power! so why we do a damn iota more than we need to? Ive burnt out so many times and all i have to show is more disability debt from the resulting crash-outs, healing, health costs, etc. Zillenial here but disabled so it balances out a smidge so i relate to gen z more economically, and economic factors are at the root of all of this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't see a problem with generally slowing down. The world is too busy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 18:20 but they kinda become to sensitive bc of how school and parents treat them. Again learning how to handle conflict and resolution. Ya gotta let them harden up a bit. Being overly sensitive isn’t gonna help them in real life
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If they say to them study or work whit Will work
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well well well look who can't adulting now
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Simple. We are depressed after seeing how miserable the older generation are. We got nothing to look forward to
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Idk what people expect, we spend 40+ hours a week working for a poverty wage no shit we’re behind in life. “ having sleep for dinner “ isn’t us gravitating toward our phones it’s literal fucking poverty. No one is hitting milestones because the job market is shit and college is a scam and we’re descending into fascism that’s going to kill a whole lot of people 🎉 it’s a party
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You can’t use the argument that it’s a different time when you also compare marriage, dating, etc, rates to the 1950’s. Sure it’s a different time because minimum wage back then could support a family of 4 in a house that you own,  off 1 person’s income. Minimum wage nowadays can get you a sandwich for 1 hour worked. I know you said you’ve talked about economics a lot so you didn’t want to bring it up again but you have to talk about the economics of what we’re experiencing. Most older people we know hate their lives because they slave away to their jobs and you can’t pursue what you want because the cost of living is exponentially higher than that of the minimum wage.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am 25 in Asia and right now I just want to figure things out, I am burnout and wish that I do my masteral one or two year later because I am too tired. Even I have a job after graduation the salary is not enough with my monthly expenses even though I limit myseft in spending wants. It's hard to be adult in days economic. Transportation hurts my budget, the food also are high. I want to cook so I can lessen my expenses but I have two siblings who wants to eat my food I am cooking for myself for lunch and my mother always says share your food and if I don't want to share they are saying I am too stingy. I just want to budget my money 😢.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Or maybe gen z isn't full of abusive bastards who only think of s3x and rush into relationships? Noone truly wants a relationship let's be honest
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We grow up. But if they compare us with kids having, house, car, marrying and external expectations ..  We are mature and older generations not. Being mature means putting action too your own life, values, needs, purpose, own sexuality life and friendship as well as romantic values. There is no settlement. Like nature and fibonacci in everything are we and brains endless growing matter never ending on any point to grow, develop, change or stop learning new things or doing failures. If you stop being unsure or doing failures, you forgot to enter new territory.  And the difference is that we dont measure on external measures over inner growth.  Permanent jobs rarely exist and matureness has nothing to do with forced milestones. This societal constructs are seen and rejected of us smart ones.  Monogamy is a construct like marrying and motherhood is. Constancy does not exist, just emotional nervous system wellbeing and shared values with people.  The view of us is also not "bad/unmature", but different style of taking responsibility. Most older adults still party, show not up for kids, destroy marriages and bonds through affairs and drugs, are ill and eat sugar, smoke and drink alcohol.  We mature first IN ourself. And that is not seen externally at an age on paper.   Psychologically most adults stopped growing after 20 and just function, but invested no steps in EQ, friendships, new hobbies, career or better self care. Cause age has nothing to do with further matureness.  Its a process. Its a will. It happens through real experience.  Biologically the brain is adult with 25, but emotional EQ and IQ in practical skills and friendship/relashionship skills as well as sexual skills reach better 32+.  21 is still being a teenager. Eating milk and lots of sugar hightens babyface even more.   Previous generations were not more mature at that age. They were less protected, forced to parenthood, jobs with a teenage brain for rest of the life and their brains had more focus without the digital work in real time. More responsibility also means not matureness.  Most kids too being forced into early responsibility are internally always kids needing therapy and regretting youth years they cant live anymore in detail like they should have.  Also siderially matureness is actually set after Saturn return as likely 32 minimum.  Time is also a construct. You need not to be anything or succeeded in anything at a set age made by society.  Real adults with pure responsibilities, joy, loving their job, emotional regulation, health care, hobbies, friends, good sex life etc. are seldom found in the world in masses.  Being mature is more like being better and doing further steps in your own time frame  We even cant be similar in culture, values or family dynamic and teaching. There is not "one" generation. I have for example 2 siblings influencing family and me. Totally different to a single child since birth in all experiences, communication and interaction for ongoing life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i'm only five minutes in, and i need to stop watching this video. this is so completely out of touch. the real reason why Gen Z can't reach adult milestones is MONEY. we can't afford to move out or have kids. this video is just dumb and entitled.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen z like how are you slowing your brain down when the time is flying fast
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When I say share they will set aside food for their lunch portion too.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 28:00 Not trusting your better judgement after COVID? Yeah I see a lot of folks with that. It’s almost like there was a narrative that proved to be wrong.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How are you supposed to make a decision if everything is filled with risk? Your parents had 10x lower risk taking their chances with life. Today it’s one mistake and you’re out, unless your parents are rich.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In some ways the economic milestones that genz are afraid to attain are sort of nonsense. Its all socially informed and changes over time: you know girls got married at 12 in ancient rome, but young men were youths into their mid 20s and still learning. Modern marriage and childrearing, where do we place that comparatively even to 50-30 years ago? These things are not static nor need to be attained by every generation, and gen z are making their own sets of goals and values too. Not having a license is a problem in a car centric society, but if you dont own a car or have access to one through family, cant afford one anyways and can use transit, why should I capitulate beyond the most basic license? People in my cohort seem to desperately want to grow up but face tension all the way: to rent  your first place you need about 3x income and good credit and if you cant even get a  full time job or youll need a cosigner like a parent. You cant "learn" out of that situation, your parent has already been called to help. Its like how entry level jobs no longer exist; theres a limbo built into the system that punishes you if you lack a strong parent backing, money or network, the things needed to take the first step that previously was accessible without them. That limbo is informed by economic factors not swaddling parents or wah wah emotionalism. You can try hard things as a kid, Ive done it,  if you cant be independent even if you (and everyone else) wants you to, what does it matter?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What if it wasn’t the fault of the parents but a result of a failed, degenerated generation much like the future?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't think Millennials were much better. I know so many that stayed in school forever to avoid working and growing up. Then only actually getting married in their mid 30s and having kids in their late 30 early 40s
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeah they don't want to pursue driving.... Not when the used car market was at an all time high after 2020. You can't buy a beat up car for beat up prices anymore (maybe you can now). My car I bought in 2022 was priced almost 15k over the price they are selling for  band new 2026 models now. Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. the "economic aspect" might not be a huge part of the problem for Gen Z, but for the other gens... yes.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It seems to me that the video is structured a bit self-contradictory: in the first half you talk about how Gen Z was raised in a cushy way, with their parents not confronting them with the challenges of life and self-responsibility, and thus not exposing them to potential trauma. And in the second half you talk about how gen z is permanently in therapy, coping with their supposed trauma from their past... which they should not have by the accounts of the first half of the video.  Maybe your point (or why you chose this focus) would have been clearer if you'd have connected those two aspects a bit more explicitly - for example that you believe these traumas come to be by the supposed inability of Gen Z to take self-responsibility. (... which, to be clear, I also wouldn't completely agree with, since the economic situation plays a more dominant role in this process, as by the critique of the other commenters.)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I also feel like we need to stop with this big ass generations, some say gen z is between 1997 and 2010/2012 and if you're born 1997 you remember when an ipad came if you're born 2012 you are YOUNGER than the ipad. In sweden we are more focused on the decades, like the people born in the 40s (40-talister) are our Boomers
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have been talking about this and predicting the current issue for 20 years. The face that the boomers have lived so long is the cause. It has forces all the generations behind them to lag si ce resources and jobs are not being freed up for them. They engineered and extended childhood for all there descendents so they can hold onto what they have for the 80 + years they are living, as opposed to moving out of the way ( dieing) in there 50 s and 60 s like people of the past. I know this sounds harsh, but it is the result of this new longevity.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Peter Pan syndrome effects women too.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: if Lions didn't choose one deer out of a big heard wondering if it is ill or not, they would have gone extinct way long ago humans came into existence.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Get a trade! Go to a vocational school for a year or two. I think people forget that jobs other than cooperate, nursing, or influencing exist.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I do not like the therapy part, sorry. I took a quick look at your sources (read through the headlines, did not read them) and it's a Guardian article (apart from the book). And you are using TikTok videos explaining (apparent) disadvantages of therapy? Who are these people?? Because I do not know them, how do I know if their takes on therapy are credible? Are they experts of some kind? Right now it seems like it's just some random women's thoughts on therapy that sound plausible enough. A lot of things can sound plausible, but turn out to be completely wrong.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why do you advertise those products to us? There are enough of ads in YT already!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I usually like your videos, but this one, as a gen Z, I didn’t like   that almost all the explanations about why gen z is terrible is from previous generations. Why don't hear what gen z has to say?  Coming to adulthood in the pandemic, and then the global crisis... yeah sure, we can compare your young year to ours
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video misses hard; I understand the belief that genz folks are "coddled" but Its a little insane to say this without the mention that the world has almost 0 incentive to live in right now. We're taught the world is dangerous, that it's unsafe, that we will be squeezed for labor with no promise of almost any of the benefits.  We weren't coddled too hard and lost the ability to take on anxiety, we are just hyper aware of how bad the world is, and how it's getting worse everyday by people older than you, and how gen x and millennials "deal" with society is incrediblly disheartening. As a generation many of feel that individualistic growth (or "growing up") is futile against those on top.   Idk man, I'm not entitled (16:55 clip), there is just no incentive or reason to "push through" an increasingly painful hellscape as a little "no frontal lobe" baby.  We didn't miss learning accountability, we just learned that we aren't the ones who need to be held accountable
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video feels like its missing the point for the most part and I’m not just talking about the economic side of it. Some of the points I get, but this video reads like a middle-aged person telling off the youths. Heck, this is an issue even millenials faced back then. Its a neverending cycle with different politics and social norms in each cycle.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this video honestly feels extremely tone deaf. most of these issues are directly caused my the current economic state of the world right now - hell job market, increased cost of living, etc. it’s not about a lack of desire it’s about a lack of opportunity
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The collapse of American quality of life is all by design and it will sadly only get worse I'm guessing. We are powerless against the families that own our country.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 2025 is not 1950. Gen Z is having a hard time reaching milestones in life because EVERYTHING IS SO DAMN EXPENSIVE.  How are we supposed to get married, be homeowners, and start a family at 25 in this economic state? In 1950, a house was 2 times the annual income. In 2025, it's up to 8 times...  Student debt through the roof  More degrees, but we have to apply to 1,000 jobs + 5-round interviews  Wages don’t keep up with inflation   Becoming a homeowner, husband, and parent is very hard when you can’t even take care of yourself.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: previous gen were having jobs easier and the economy did benefit them for their productivity, working and independence were rewarding now they are punishment, you cant earn enough to afford basic things, its not gen z dont want to its that gen z just cant. the wage you get for work is nowhere close to how much work you put and that wage isnt keeping with inflation either.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i feel like this video is very out of touch truthfully
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Lol imagine blaming the kids. IN THIS ECONOMY. This is just rage bait.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: FIRST! You are Gen Z’s arch nemesis 😂 edit: So crazy, in the middle of the video that I released yesterday, I had a corrupt audio file, I even added a title ‘Corrupt audio file brought to you by Tascam’ as I attempted to salvage the scratch audio. Then as I’m watching your video I’m looking at your mic thinking ‘I bet she never had to worry about that’ 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes the state of the world sucks right now But I think the excuse of that has held Gen Z back. Like when you can shrug off the state of your won life, choices, and negative attributes by saying “of course I’m like this the world sucks” it doesn’t really help:  As a zillenial I am living in the same shitty world, but didn’t grow up with the same mindset of the world being fucked. The world was actually pretty bright until I entered adulthood. And even tho I’m not where I’d have hoped to be, I’m still making it happen.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its ok some of us millenials esp the ones with out kids still live at home, and are not sure what we are doing with our lives.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I LOVE your videos- with that said, please look into the founder/owner of scent bird before you continue sponsorship with them. She is insane and spouts some really dangerous conspiracy theories. I wouldn’t be taking money from them! ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Something something it's the economy, stupid. There are 1000s of applicants to entry level jobs, I see my peers who have moved out of home miserable struggling to keep up with rent and cost of living, even staying at home is expensive supporting my parents after the massive interest rate hikes after covid they can barely afford their mortgage. A lot of people around me straight up have zero expectation of anything good happening ever again. I was having a chat with my friend the other day, trying to think of when the last time a really good thing happened in society, couldn't think of anything that wasn't just the absence of a bad thing or lessening of a bad thing. The internet turned out to be a parasite. The economy gets worse every year for the average person while you get flaunted in front of your face how amazing life is for the exploiters at the top. Chances are we will never afford a house of our own. And to top it off, the planet is dying and no government will do a thing about it because they are paid off by those same interests who benefit from keeping you poor. It's not coddled, it's jaded.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The comments are proving the point of this video, lol. Well done @AshleyEmbers.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 15:11 my critique isn't exactly relevant to the topic of the video, but I would suggest looking more into the author of that book and how actual psychologists have responded to her work. Definitely not a trustworthy source unfortunately
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 31:58 I don't believe this chick has taken a deep breath ever in her life LOL
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Tbh this seems like a criticism that should’ve been pointed at Gen Alpha considering the youngest Gen Zs are on their way to college or already there. Also, this video is extremely out of touch and I was ready to leave after the first 2 mins.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bro they are broke and depressed. At least we had a couple decent years in our childhoods.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like not all of gen z is lagging behind but I do think it has a lot to do with the culture around them. I live in Idaho and a decent amount of young people are getting married and having kids. I feel like the culture is more family centered. I got married at 20 and we are planning on having kids in a year or so once my husband is more comfortable in his new nursing job. Like I know a lot of people who got married any where from 18 which is way too young for me personally to 24. My sister in law is 25 and she has three kids.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Let they think for themselves they can think and search for an answear
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't get why 'i live with my parents ' is such a taboo in the western world. You have the cost of living crisis, no domestic help culture, horribly inadequate parental leave..but you still look down on living with your family..? It's absurd! It's time you took some lessons from Asian community.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's in fact perfectly normal to spend your life in and out of therapy. Not everybody can just one and done with the shit in their lives   Lots of people can make use of 6 months to a year of therapy take a break whatever, but don't assume that therapy is something that a person will not need chronically the same way they may need dialysis weekly.    I'm not going to listen to someone say that they know more about whether or not someone needs therapy then the person who is experiencing that situation.  And to insist that therapy begins with a demanded end date is absurd. And negotiates therapy to something transactional. Something that is not meant to be a support system, but is meant to be treated like one has the flu and needs to be given antibiotics.   It's not helpful to demand people expect therapy to end while they're still finding it useful.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's capitalism & an individualistic culture. We grew up in an age of social media creating a panopticon, we're constantly being watched. We're hyper aware of everything going on around us, & everything that could go wrong. In more communal cultures, children leaving their families later is normal, but now due to the cost of living crisis we are forced to choose between  living with our parents, roommates, or struggling to live by ourselves. Edit: on the note of gen z struggling to commit, it's okay. And we do need to commit, because if you want to change your mind thats okay, a decision is better than nothing. I wasted so much time being indecisive, trust me it's better just to pick something and change your mind if you dont like it. Markiplier dropped out when he only had a semester left & it worked out for him, if it doesn't work out for you, it's just something you'll have to navigate. So much is out of our control, and you have decades to figure it out, it's okay if things fall apart because you can always begin again.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 30 tho it's not much better for me but at least when I was 7 8 it wasn't this bad.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 7:52 didn’t you say you hate subscriptions in the video about people owning less physical stuff¿
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here. Leave Gen Z alone, from all generations, they have it the worst and need copium and defense mechanisms badly. On the other hand, they also have the best awareness and if someone is capable of changing the system by absolutely refusing to comply with it, it's them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 3:46 - when it comes to cars and driving a lot of us just really don't have the money? Jobs don't pay enough to provide for all your basic needs anymore so many of us if we wanted the full works of independence, we would have to work at least 2 jobs or living in a multiple income situation of some sort. A single minimum wage job barely covers food and rent, how on earth is a student supposed to balance car payments and insurance without going into extreme debt? Only to then be called stupid and dumb by financial auditors for "Getting themselves into that situation' when it is literally society forcing us to and our own gov't putting people into said debt. :/
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Now, there is also the issue of all these people making these sorts of videos and saying "gen z this, gen z that", and just are lumping every person in the ",set timeframe," all together --- without realizing it's not so cut and dry.   Those born from like, ~1998 to ~2004/2005, had a very different experience than those born in say, ~2010.  The "pioneers / initial Gen Z'ers", which are their own group at the start, did not grow up with a tablet/screen in their face. They got to play outside, groups of bikes laying in front of a house, running around neighborhoods + parks with all the other kids around, catching TV shows at specific times, sleepovers, and tons of other "classic / old / 'vintage'" sort of things: and all whilst simultaneously watching / experiencing the "old / previous" way-state of life-society, and seeing the beginning of the extreme change that was in motion as the phones/screens/tech began to release, expand, watching as it was becoming evermore ingrained into everything/everyone, and then as it started altering + corrupting all things/peoples in the world...  All of which, created a pretty significant gap/experience for this initial grouping, compared to those born in the later the timeframe...   It is actually, really truly, a very very unique experience and possible perspective for those in that timeframe to have... Knowing the old ways, and being there to absorb / learn the ways of the new world as it grew, really allowed for a pretty solid understanding of it all as it came about. Access / knowing / experience to the old as well as the new; something that those born later did not have at all; or those older generations.  Very unique placement for those; "waves of spawns" in that transitioning period... That's a better word for that group perhaps -- the Transitionary Time, between a falling world and and emerging one...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: so what if i dont have a drivers license im 19 and i can do it but like i dont want to cuz i dont want a car... is it ever actually that deep 💀i hate when millenials whine about gen z in this way then diminishing our economic concerns or just our personal choices
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got good news for you, kiddos.  You don't have to have it figured out yet.  I'm Gen-X and I was 40 before I figured it out. And it took another five years before that figuring it out bore real fruit in the form of paid-off debt and getting bumped up a tax bracket.  Just keep bettering yourself and it'll come out in the wash. Ain't easy, but it wasn't easy in my time and it wasn't in my Boomer parents' time and it never was before.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im hoping a world war can atleast bring me some sort of prosperity if not then i guess the blackmarket will do
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m confused you’re not really supposed to have your life figured out at 22… that’s Jung. I didn’t have my life fully figured out till I was like 25 and there was nothing wrong with that. Also it’s totally normal to live with your parents in your early 20s. I remember I had to move home for Nursing School.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You make growing up sound depressing…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This entire video reads like a millennial speaking on an issue that they very clearly don’t understand. The economic state of the world is in shambles the cost to get a car, an education, have hobbies, and have kids has skyrocketed. Meanwhile wages have stagnated and with the threat of A.I looming on the horizon the future does not look bright. Gen Z has been overrun by nihilism and anxiety, and it’s easy to see why. Wealth distribution is fucked, the job market is fucked,the cost of education is fucked, the housing market is fucked, and every other day we learn that something else is fucked. I mean they passed “The Big Beautiful Bill Act” on the 4th of July of all days, if that doesn’t show you how fucked we are I don’t know what will.   This comment is pretty negative so I want to end things on a good ish note. Despite all of the terrible things I’ve mentioned above all isn’t lost. Changes can still be made and there is still hope that things will get better. Let’s all work together, be cognizant of the plights of others, and help make the world a better place <3
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I really don’t think parents have a treat ready every 5 mins etc. I don’t think this is much to do with parenting. There are a LOT of emotionally unintelligent and shitty parents still. I know bc I’m a heterosexual woman who’s 30 (young millenial/cusp gen z) and I date men :) men who’ve suffered so much emotional neglect from their parents! I was also raised to be very self sufficient. I think this is far more the result of the economy infantilising generations of kids and young adults and social media making them amenable, dopamine stricken and unmotivated/lacking discipline with nothing to work towards bc even if you do get a decent job you still can’t afford to meet many of the milestones our parents did. Couple that with Covid, exam changes, AI etc and you have a perfect storm.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s not their fault. Look at how absolutely everything is broken right now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah L premise and 0 nuance even if the video is "long". Just massive extrapolation and speculation on shallow and outdated opinions from out of touch older people.  Your intro represents this video well, wordy but 0 meaning, super generalized and nothing specific
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i competely disagree with this mindset as an millennial gen y because i am not ok with the majoritiy forcing us to do certain things we don't wanna do in life please just let them be respect everyone's free will path and difference unquie perpective i think nobody is right or wrong us having free will path and difference pointt of view perspective there's nothing wrong with that at all to me in my honest unpopular point of view perspective
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They said this about millennials too
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: gotta watch Puer Aeternus by Dr.K for those who wanna deep dive in the real Peter Pan syndrome, this is good content, but surface lvl
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's not our fault we feel robbed of our 20's because of covid! We aged but we didnt live at all. Then to add salt to injury world economy is going to hell, the world is burning. We might as well enjoy ourselves and keep on a state of dreaming
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a 19 year old who actually left home to be independent, this video is so out of touch. Its hard for us to achieve milestones when we get paid less and everything costs more. Im literally turning 20 and I still get paid teen wages. How are we supposed to afford everything the past generations were able to get so easily when back then, a house only cost 5 pounds
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m genuinely curious, what’s the point of analyzing generational cohorts? To me, it feels like astrology.  What does this accomplish?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I honestly do not blame them; their brains are fried from constant social media and short-form content. They live in a world where they are constantly judged for everything they do, and they also missed a significant part of their childhood due to COVID. The economy is struggling, especially for those just starting out. $ 30 an hour is the average needed to survive, and if you're in a city, it's significantly more. Life is full of unaffordable milestones. There are also issues, such as AI taking jobs left and right, making it harder to decide what you want to do for a living. You don't know if AI will take over in a couple of years; by the time you graduate from college, your job might be completely automated. We don't know. Wooo, 95 babies in the middle of a generational shift. My best friend is trying to move out of his mom's house into an apartment with his gf. It is tough for them because the rent is so high; they are working together over 40 hours a day, which translates to over $80,000 a year, and can't find a decent apartment to move into that fits their budget.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hate subscriptions that prevent you from owning anything. I still have many subscriptions in my life where I get physical things out of it 😊
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this gen z over here wouldn't make any difference ever...😭 but you right...just let us off the hook for a little bit maybe we'll become better?... personally I'm pretty directionless in life as a 25yr old right now...idk what life has in store for me but hoping it's not filled with disappointment as always(swear I'm not this pessimistic all the time lol)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They still had a fighting chance though….. The US dollar is loosing value and we have no foreseeable hope.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hard is not impossible. Try harder. Migrate. Jobs are not supposed to come to you. You come to them. Drugs and the terminally online is the standard for Gen Z, and it explains much of the apathy. They're already comforted, so why  stress yourself out?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@itheuserfirst3186 lmao, I am working mate. I work and study at the same time, AND AS A YOUNG PERSON, I am telling you the problem. We earn only $40k-$50k a year here in Australia as a 19-22 year old, even less if youre below 18. That income isnt enough to rent as rents are $450-$600 a fortnight, and housing cost $500k-$1million. Your savings are dead if you even think about going to university without parental support. This is a new economy, and I doubt older generations could survive the expenses we face without going on a riot. We don't need to work harder, we already work hard for nothing. We need affordable housing more than ever.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's notbeh problem with gen z people. It's ye exorbitant inflation rates for homes, cars etc
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well when you live in a consumer society we shouldn’t be shocked.  Be part of the political process. Workers have to fight together and trust me you work. There are only a certain amount of millionaires and billionaires and we pretty much know all of them by name, and you ain’t on that list…Trust.  Fight for the working class no matter your age. Stop playing into this generational rhetoric that keeps us from showing up as a whole to the voting booth.  Vote, it’s that simple. Just vote.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Many of these comments reinforce the points made in the video IMO
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My husband always says “don’t steal the struggle” when it comes to our toddler ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How do y'all live with wanting to end it all everyday
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I understand the premise of the video: saying that gen z was too sheltered. Its actually what most millenials say about gen z. But the world was pretty much dangerous during the times of gen z growing up.. society is more vile than it used to be.. i personality dont blame my parents for sheltering us at all..now ethically morally its worse...  Millenial peers tend to actually be ok with working and adult responsibilities.. its just crazy.. with the severe underpayments and actually feeding into the traditions and culture which simply  doesnt align with any state of satisfaction.. what is even the point. Gawd..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z was the first generation to be raised almost entirely on the Internet, and social media. Social media is one big tabloid of petty grievances. I think the mainstreaming of marijuana has created a generation of apathy because they've got their vape, and their Door Dash, Uber, and video games. They don't need independence like former generations. They can live their life in a bubble, and never have to become independent. Just because the odds are stacked against you (like every generation) doesn't mean you can't achieve. Play by the rules that you are dealt, and then change them. Gen Z seems different in that it is not that concerned about human rights, racism, and criminality. They don't care because what does that have to do with gaming night?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yet you had 23 year olds leading Brigades in the America Civil War.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think Gen Z has spent too much time trying to conform, which is the social pressure on social media. And this has forced gen z to sacrifice some individuality, which you can see just by looking at gen z’s faces and outfits. No joke. No joke. So the conformity is metastasized into disappointment
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's an illusion. Previous generations were absolutely insane. They never grew up either. You rise up, bloom (22-25) then it's all decay from there. The idea of being someone is just a motivational tool because we're designed to just survive the day. The more convenient things become with society and tech, the less accomplished everyone feels because it's low effort. Here's the secret: that's a good thing - just enjoy. There's no real goal in life other than survival and meeting someone who truly loves you. That's it. Why most channels are just propaganda to sell their books on how to motivate yourself to achieve when most of it is rigged and funded.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Are we ready to have the “H1B & immigration ruining the housing & job market” conversation yet or is that still racist?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: video dropped 53 seconds ago but I already know it's peak cinema
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an Englishman, I have to say, I'm not enamoured by the educational system in the USA.  Sounds horrid to me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Multiple genocides, imminent societal collapse of THE global superpower, awful pay, late stage capitalism, AI replacing work no matter how shitty the AI itself is, and old people refusing to try to even help any of this and instead yelling at the youth sure does make it hard. ONE medical scare and suddenly youre fucked for the next 20 years.  Sorry, i dont think its gen Zs fault. I think its the state of the world driving gen Z to respond accordingly, which is IGNORE EVERYTHING NOT IMMEDIATELY NECESSARY, and in this era, the only thing immediately necessary is trying desperately to keep that account in the green.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this isn’t a problem with gen z and their parents tho, it’s more gen alpha want millennial parents
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fake ahh, argument. Maybe it's because nobody in America has any financial prospects beyond paying rent until they die. Can't "grow up" and "become independent", when you can't even afford to move out without working 50hrs/week. This is strictly an American phenomenon. So no, it's not the age, it's the culture.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There is no viable direction, go to university and get no job so thats a dead end, go into the trades and get hard physical laboir for 40 hours a week for no money, so thats just modern slavery, marriage is too expensive, as are kids. Whats is there left to do
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How is that relevant to anything said in the video?💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @Thechosen1000 ”no direction, no drive, and absolutely no adulting”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I used to be indecisive, but now I'm not so sure.  :/
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Can’t even afford rent, I can afford it but they won’t rent to you because they want 3x the rent in gross earnings. And I don’t have any friends because I got isolated by parents against my will. I literally can’t be independent
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its every generation... no more retirement, working or just trying to exist until we die and Jesus comes back.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z in particular grew up surrounded by doom at every turn. Wars, housing crisis, social media and technology’s out of control rise, now AI, mainstream fascism in the U.S., and an affordability crisis. It’s the perfect storm of overwhelming challenges to create total paralysis and avoidance. That being said— Gen Z are adults now. Not children. These aren’t teenagers avoiding the things they don’t want to do, it’s adults who’ve lost hope because the world is on fire.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video is interesting, but I'm sick to come across every other week a video titled "Gen Z this" "Gen Z that", almost always depicting Gen Z as bunch of essentially useless people incapable of doing anything in life  I'm a Gen z myself, born in 2002, i'm a student working a job to pay for my studies and I'm struggling with depression and anxiety, and this is honestly tiring to be put in the same category of those people in my generation that will find any excuses to not get out there  I know there's the state of the world that is almost apocalyptic, lack of prospect for the future and mental health, but I feel like most of the time, some people use it as an excuse to just do nothing and complain  The world is what it is, and there's nothing you can do about it  But you can decide to take control of your life, and it's hard but you have to do it because nobody will do it for you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey so FYI the book Bad Therapy may not the best source for this. I’d recommend watching Psychology with Dr. Ana and her professional take on it. Also, the author wrote a very, very transphobic book. Just wanted to let you know.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why would anyone invest time effort and money into themselves when the state of the world is completely unknown in the next 10 years. Imagine  taking on a ton of debt just for education and housing and in 10 years those jobs just are not sustainable or obtainable. There is no time for fulfillment if you chose that route everything is too expensive, there are no third spaces, older generations gakekeep information and hobbies we don’t fit in in any sub cultures. Why would you invest your time in that mess. No more relationships, no communities, no money, no passions, no margin of error things are just too expensive to fail at anything even something as small as cooking.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There are no jobs. So of course they can't grow up - the system is not allowing them to.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sure the economic issue is big as everyone as discussed. But bottom line is I can't believe the number of GenZ that won't grow up. The whole drivers license thing, just get it. So many jobs require it and have vehicles you can use.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sucks to be apart of this generation, everyone so soft now
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I love that parents are spending more time nurturing their children. It's certainly needed.  Capitalism is unnatural so failing capitalism is not bad.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an early Gen Z I feel like it's pretty much a western thing instead of a generational issue. If this was analysed in a wider context perhaps some other issues could be brought to light. Gen Zs in different parts of the world don't have choice paralysis, they don't have choices. Honestly, listening to white privileged kids complain about what I'd dare to call a made up problem is so representing of overall western culture which can be seen as people who have the privilege to have better lives but choose to live as victims. Is the economic situation in the west bad? The economic situation is bad EVERYWHERE, do something about it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This kind of content is what causes it. You're talking, while tiktok videos are playing, while text is being shown in the videos. To understand what's going on I need to keep up with 3 different streams of information , thanks but I can't be dealing with this kind of brain scrambling infodump style. Personally I can't even focus on what you're saying and read some news report on the screen at the same time, when was this normalised I wonder?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And just to piggy back off of giving children space to play, to you helicopter parents, PLEASE, if my children wants to engage with your child at the playground, that does not give you the right to helicopter my child as well.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Niccccceee we need less people driving, only people who want to drive
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 30:10 that lady is just saying the same stuff over and over... Seems like a very insecure / anxious person... "I'm so introspective and I totally look at things with all different perspectives".... Okay. Say it once and move on. To keep repeating it just comes off as insecurity or being full of oneself. You can't always make the "right" decision... Most are fully  choosing all themselves to be stuck.... You can't know everything, until one operates from the heart; from within; when ones gut / inner self is guiding the way....  People really need to get in the "flow state" some more.... Just go with the flow. There's no such thing as "perfect", just like there's no such thing as "coincidence"... Have a spine, some backbone. Actually work on yourself, if can put the phone down for more than 5 minutes, lmao ... If can face true silence.   Temet Nosce ....  31:50 lady is just yikes.... Way too much there, and it's too late to keep typing this stuff that none will take any value from anyways. "Gotta make the most of my one life, my one chance".... That's totally wrong and false. But of course will fall under "personal beliefs of what this reality entails", so likely to be a fruitless discussion if expanded upon any further here.... If one is going to choose to place their full hearted beLIEf into the religion of modern-science-ism/nihilism, and then have it dictate / effect their entire beings so intensely... Well, that's very unfortunate; and is exactly doing what it was intended/fashioned to make people feel & be like.... Very very unfortunate for those who become lost in those lies of this "modern" age...  All realizing that the social media is so bad yet still soaking it in.  Her thoughts are racing so fast because never sit down and breathe; close eyes, go into the silence... That one appears to be totally in a state of utter fear all the time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't want to work 40+ hours a week to secure someone else's future. They fact is, the system is a trap designed to take their hard work and funnel it's benefit to some rich-ass Boomer. They aren't lazy, they aren't stupid, they see the punji pit that's in front of them and they do not want to walk in to it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Welcome to capitalism my gen z comrades, start familiarising yourselves with socialist theory or fall alongside capitalism.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 29:36 As someone who's somewhere in the muddy grey zone between gen z and millennial. I see this sort of decision paralysis a lot with folks my age and younger. And I think it's because we're always being shown the "right" & "perfect" way to do/be/achieve/exist online. And that's just not real life. No matter how perfectly, meticulously, and intensely you plan. No matter how many specific things that could go wrong that you plan for. Life will just give you the bird and put you through some stuff. It'll go wrong. Often. That doesn't mean it's over, or that you failed too badly to go forward. It's a lesson. Those moments, if you take the time to look at them for what they are, are the moments that lead to lives greatest moments. In the wake of failure, mistakes, or just shit being out of your control and going wrong, those are the most beautiful moments. Those are the true experiences. Those are the times when you truly understand yourself and the world and get the privilege to make an informed decision.  As someone who's made countless mistakes, made the "wrong" decision again and again, and just had life give me the bird a lot. I'm loving my life. They were all experiences that are valuable to me beyond words because they gave me and taught me what I needed to build something truly beautiful for my life. Social media lies to you. Life isn't about creating this perfectly curated situation to exist safely in. It's about experiencing. But that takes a level of self trust. And gen z has never allowed themselves to build self trust.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The whole parents being nurturing so children are more cautious and less likely to make a transition to adulthood is such a myth. Children of nurturing parents are actually more likely to have secure attachments and are better able to be independent. Yes, Gen Z were raised by nurturing parents and they are having a harder transition to adulthood but correlation does not equal causation. There are also a lot of stuff at play here, the economic situation and job market is abysmal, mental illness and chronic illness especially due to the ramifications of covid are at an all time high. Gen Z is forced out of independence because there is no money to make and they are to mentally and physically unwell to make it. That is not their fault. I am in between generations and consider myself a millenial even though if I were born a day later I would be gen Z and you're like 2 years away from being Gen Z. We are more or less in the same boat as them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You really need to stop holding hand above there heads for GEN Z. Yes a lot of  problems are because the older GEN but GEN Z just accept the outcome instead of try to change it. They give up because they can't or don't see it could be differed. Life is not easy nor should it be when young.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Aging is hard and it’s been hard for every generation. This generation can just express it via the internet. I feel like my generation went through the same things. The last five years of your twenties is kinda depressing. Then you hit 30 and it’s not that bad actually. This is not a new  feeling or fear, it’s called aging.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Boo-Hoo. Man-up. No one is going to save you. Be your own hero.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nope, I had to fight tooth and nail to get mine. In nc you can’t get a license without insurance, but you can’t get insurance without a car, but you can’t get a car without a job, but you can’t get a job without a car. And non owners insurance isn’t allowed anymore without a car. That makes it completely dependent upon your parents and most parents are awful
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Capitalism is not failing, at least not for us. People have no job,no house but still spending money on labubus, and stupid things like that . At this point Trump is going to end capitalism faster than us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I, as a gen z/a kid, actually feel so bad when I see kids with helicopter parents. They barely even get to build basic decision making skills.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an older Gen Z (98) myself I think you are right on the money. But I think a huge problem with our current culture/climate is that mistakes are STRONGLY discouraged and self-righteous finance bros love to throw them back in your face when you state that you’re struggling financially or emotionally because of a setback/mistake. And the stakes are a lot higher than they once were as well. If my parents made half of the same mistakes nowadays rather than the late 70s/80s, they would be NOWHERE near as well off as they are now. They would be in dire straits. I was also very discouraged from screwing up while growing up and it honestly really messed me up as an adult. Which is ridiculous considering messing up is a very normal part of the human experience, and something that I am trying to remind myself of daily. I shouldn’t have felt like my life was over because I dropped out of college at 19 and my parents’ perfectly curated plan for my life was ruined. I have zero regrets with dropping out considering the fact that I am not saddled with insane student loan debt and literally work the same job as folks with college degrees. Which is something that my boomer parents can’t seem to wrap their heads around.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: people still think vegetables are healthy? enjoy your oxalates
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the more i watch the more I find your arguments incredibly ignorant, also using a tiktok as a scientific fact is ??? more than questionable
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Join the Human Resistance: glad you are doing this. Maybe less facts and more argument? Consciously dropping out is a reasonable choice but that still requires deciding who you want to be in the world. Making a choice the taking responsibility. Maybe your audience should be sad Sartre or get a gen X friend?

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 0:49 what a doggie dookie take. It’s the economy. The entire planet’s population didn’t suddenly produce “lesser children”, people are responding to increasingly bad economic conditions
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 15:14 not you quoting the anti trans author... look into her other books im not sure shes a good source for this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This woman is an example of the problem
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Buying a house is not a human right. Protections from the world’s ills like climate change and adherence to your pronouns are not a human right. Your need to be seen is not a human right.   People of previous generations have six figure jobs because we paid dues and worked towards it. We didn’t have safe spaces or work “cultures” - we just worked to death and then worked to death the next day and eventually promoted and got it done. We had horrible bosses who didn’t care about our feelings and HR was just a room where new hires got processed - literally. So you want success and money and validation? Grow a pair. That’s the only way it happens, GenZ.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video was completely tone deaf. Older people continue to fail to realize that they are the ones who set us up for this sort of failure and won’t bother to take responsibility for it. The economic status of the world is about 90% of the problem, it always comes back to that. The topic deserves more than to be addressed in a shitty comment after realizing that it was completely neglected in the video.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not to mention the biggest elephant that everyone ignores, climate change. I will be in 44 in 2050, have you ever heard anything good about the year 2050 and on?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it's because older generations have literally ruined our generation and many gen z started working at 18-16 or even 18 full-time or part-time depending on their situation to help fix it and support themselves and their family members who literally ruined it. so yeah when I have to go work a full time college and make 80k just to survive in my state, I'm going to have less of a direction and drive from the amount of stress from the mess that people like YOU (older, likely millennial) have left.   I will have ~50k USD in student loans and what I need 90k on a down payment for a home and rent here is $3000-7000 just for a flat/loft I think tf not it takes the average adult with a full-time job above minimum wage 5 years in my state to save up for home. that also doesn't include adults with children or ones without dual income.   and your "haha" at the end of your pinned comment is out of touch. this video misses hard, it's sht tbh.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 'problematic' means 'i don't like it as it is not politically correct' but it does not mean 'wrong'. so, maybe you are the problem, and you know it on some level.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i usually love your takes but this one isn’t it. i’m gen z (24), had a license at 16, moved out of home at 17 and have been independent with my partner since then, now have two children and we are about to buy our own house.   every single point here is because of the economy. you cannot skip over the reason why these issues are so prevalent in the younger generation. i’m from australia, and getting a house or even a rental is literally impossible. you have 150 people turning up to inspections for rentals, and you’re battling investors that can offer 10% more than you when you’re buying.   you can’t find stability unless you have financial privilege and freedom, typically through generational wealth.   i am so disappointed in this video, it literally just sounds like you’re blaming gen z for being lazy and not wanting to grow up, when many of gen z literally can’t.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: A lot of these comments seem to be based around cities and social media. There's a whole country out there. Some places still have good paying trades and rent for less than $1000. If you feel stuck, try a new place away from the cities and liberalism. I drug a Gen Z friend away from California, and he's thriving now and seeing how his friends and beliefs were holding him back. He just needed a good eye opening and a kick out the door after I gave him the knowledge and work ethic he needed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We want to grow, but y'all are not helping us at all economically.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I blame the parents mostly for this more than I could blame the state of the economy. Shielding your kid from figuring out the world on their own is the biggest reason why we see the lack of independence in the younger generation. This is coming from an almost 22 yo who has been shielded by an overprotective mother and a stepfather who thinks I'm weak, yet, wants to handhold me because he doesn't want me to hurt his ego or challenge him
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I can't believe you are promoting Scentbird... You do know about who runs it, right??
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You sound like you've never actually substantially talked to one of us your entire life. We're not at fault here. It straight up feels like the world hates us and WANTS us to fail. I want to "grow up". I want a job. Hell i'd love a car even. Maybe even a cat or a kid or two.  But honestly with the way this world is? That probably will never happen. I cant afford ANYTHING. I STILL cant find a job. All i want is maybe friends and some real income but the avenues to these things simply dont exist.  We were fucked from the start. Stop blaming us for it. If anyone is the problem, it's people like you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Cause this stuffs fake people acting like harry Truman
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z talks a lot of shit for a bunch of people too scared to leave their bedrooms
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Do you even talk to other people? What studies are this? The world is falling apart and their suppose to be like "haha okay lets buy a house."  Yall this shit is whack and you believe this?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: youre saying a bunch of nostalgic obtuse nothing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ummm maybe it’s late stage capitalism, our planet being burned alive by corporations with no consequences, and consistently being thrown in the trash by employers who prioritize profit/hierarchy/white supremacy over people/collectivism
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeahhhh this missed hard lol not at all understanding the issues at hand amd just playing into generational stereotyping rather than the actual issue which is the working class are getting stomped further and further into poverty to the point there is literally no hope left so why would anyone try? Also, you nean we are living with parents longer than other generations since the boomers.... we have far more in common with those from the great depression. Also, literally none of us are "getting what we want" we are getting no jobs and a social system crashing we are told we are expected to fix where prior generations messed up. How on earth is that coddling? Every young person I know has been fighting injustice and overworking themselves just to make the future survivable. You have completely missed the actual problem here. Also within gen z, its the opposite, they arent rushing into marriages or having kids or stupid financial decisions because we have more maturity than prior generations and refuse to make such big decisions on a hormonal rush before our brains have finished developing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think you need to be more careful talking about talk therapy. A good therapist is not focusing on the past and dwelling on past traumas. It’s not about indulging in sob stories and staying stuck. They connect the past to present issues and help patients recognize why they’re struggling and figure out a way forward. It’s very beneficial, and I highly disagree with your commentary. And have you been to group therapy? Because for me, it wasn’t about listening to sad people. It’s about getting resources from people and learning from their experiences. Maybe stay in your lane if you’re not a professional in the mental health realm.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Mhm.... Quite ironic considering all the shit they have given millennials. 🤔 But hey welcome to the club, the boomers and Gen X will never let us have any.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The owner of scentbird is quite literally a n*zi and the fact that you took a sponsorship from them without looking into the company and its values is really upsetting, unsubscribing but hopefully you will not support companies like this moving forward
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When will previous generations see this and help out?! Boomers get out of those starter homes...employers hire younger folks, because the cycle of the next generation moving up and taking leadership isn't happening if y'all keep being in the way
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why is everything traumatizing now? Get over it! War is traumatizing. Abuse is traumatizing. Not getting what u want with everything is not traumatizing. Just sounds like an excuse to be a victim.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I had seen some of your videos before and I was okay with them, but this? Blaming Gen Z for being slow when the world, the job market, and the economy are all together stacked against most people under 30? That's absurd. Most of the "adult responsibilities" cannot happen without a $150K USD/year job in the USA, and proportional quantities in other economies, and that, assuming you don't already have that much debt. My 5 years younger brother is thriving in live "more than me" in part because he entered the work force in a so much better paid industry, right before that industry began stopping hiring. My industry, by existence, pays less, even though I try to save, I simply cannot seize on my own the same amount in savings he has. And even considering he is thriving, he will struggle, because home ownership has become so much expensive (and arguably more inconvenient) in the country he lives. It's not infantilizing to postpone "adult" live choices when you simply cannot access the resources to make those choices.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Seriously, does it not dawn on these millions of people that they are not going to achieve fame and a place in the history books by filming themselves looking in them mirror of their phone's camera, acting like they're being candid? It's simple: stop being a disingenuous person. Accept your real life and stop trying to get likes for your hackneyed videos of regurgitated videos, filming yourself prattling on, in a car or putting make up on. Try thinking about something that isn't popular to think about for once, that isn't society-centric, like something scientific, philosophical, imaginative, creative, something that isn't bound by what you think the lowest common denominator online will give you props for.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Cushy, for who? Scared of rejection? It takes money even if you get rejected lol. So out of touch and tone deaf.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It is not fair to compare now with 1950's.... Condoms, safe sex, women's rights to vote etc etc did not exist.... If you wanted a live as a woman, then you needed a man back then.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You’re talking a lot of shit behind a screen.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes. I agree that most things are exaggerated, but even parents arguing can be traumatizing. Look at my brother.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@SpecklewingWhat's wrong with your brother?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: DID YOU REALLY MENTION SENDING A 9YO KID TO THE STORE ALONE?! I know I come from a country where kidnappings are more common than in the US, BUT 9YO KIDS ARE NOT SAFE IN THE USA EITHER. Are you out of your mind?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 95 is often used as the cut off so she’s actually a perfect hybrid. Most 90s babies can lean either way since they’re on the cusp. Same thing for 60s babies being boomers/genx
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And civilization was better. Every successful civilization is a patriarchal warrior culture. We live off the bones of them now, which is why you see the eroding of all. This will only leave a power gap, which will once again lead to warrior patriarchal cultures. The barbarians are always destined to conquer the cattle agricultural societies and become the new nobility. It is iron and only its coldness that nation's to thrive.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I usually love your video essays but I was completely turned off and stopped watching as soon as I heard you mention scentbird. Have you not seen who owns that company? I’m surprised that with your expertise you’d be supporting such a terrible person. She even defends Hitler as some sort of genius, among so many other wacko things. I’d strongly recommend you and anyone else reading this to do some research on these companies before spending your hard earned money on making these crazy people more rich than they already are.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Holy cow I’ve been having this conversation a lot and I’ve pretty much been saying exactly all of your solutions. Our parents were not around us 24/7 entertaining us we were to go outside and play or play with our toys independently. At appropriate ages of course you’re not saying this to a two year old but I think that’s why so many parents are burnt out too because they put that strain on themselves to keep their child entertained 24/7 it’s not sustainable or realistic because when that child becomes an adult they are not going to have someone constantly doing it for them they need to know how to self soothe and entertain themselves ❤. Great video.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the comparison to people in the 50s is wild lol why would you even bring that up?  while this video identifies the issues a lot of Gen Zers face and makes some valid points it mostly just comes across as out of touch in the way you talk about these things. as a fellow milennial (94) i feel like thought pieces like this hardly ever work because we have to generalize a very diverse demographic, and that never really helps. not to mention that we milennials literally suffer from the same issues but all of a sudden a lot of us are positioning ourselves above Gen Z in a condescending way. Let‘s not turn into boomers please.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The one thing this video proved is that a lot of Gen Z can't take criticism even if it's not inherently bad. Look at the comments.... Sheesh
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 38:22 I think that's the issue though. Millennial's and Gen Z-ers were told "you can have, do and be anything you want in life" it wasn't necessarily followed up with "if you work hard. If you sacrifice this to get this. If yoi do X, Y and Z to get there" we were just told we could have anything in life. Then we became adults and realised we couldn't have everything. The big career jobs are far few and in-between, so we've ended up working normal day to day jobs that we weren't necessarily prepared for. Cost of living is expensive so going on holiday 2- 5 times a year like we did with our parents is non-existant. Most of us can't afford to comfortably have kids. Dating is atrocious! It's not the life we were promised.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: GenZ has been helicoptered and protected so much and instead of solving problems themselves they've been taught to go to authorities to solve everything. We've never pushed them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Your time is going to come to lead the country and the concern is you will not be ready. Learning to drive doesn’t cost money, so even if you can’t afford to buy a car or insurance, it’s still important to have the skills of driving. You may get a job that includes a company car or truck driving is actually well-paying so you should at least be ready for the day you can own your own car. Try to apply this to other areas. Learn as much as you can for free, collect skills. Ask to shadow people who are doing things, even if it’s your neighbor doing yard work or building a deck. The more skills you have the more confidence you have and the more value you bring to any table.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The problem with GenZ is they were raised way to soft, comfy, cozy lifestyle.  Life isn't easy, so to expect them to just figure it out as an adult is wrong.  They also had unique challenges such as the internet/social media which destroyed their childhoods.  You have feminism lying to women that a career will make them happy over having a partner/family.   Materialism will make you happy not experiences or relationships.  Boomers socially changed everything by kicking kids out of home at 18, selling the family farms.  They removed all the benefits they would get (retirements, pensions etc) and any future generation will get a fraction of any.   They didn't teach/pass down any of the skills the great/silent generation taught them.    GenZ has many issues but a lot of it was caused by terrible timing, a very weird liberal way of thinking in trying unproven parenting tactics.  I am a GenXers so I have seen both sides if it even matters.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its Faminist culture collapse. The Latinos making up over 50% of homeowners, households, etc. are not confised
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: feel like some ppl are holding back about this video. this was a BAD angle to approach this topic. yes “parenting” differences contribute to such issues, but a lot of Gen Z come from working parents and don’t have the helicopter infrastructure mentioned here. Like a lotta ppl brought up: it’s the economy. You said kids need to fail and fail hard; how can I fail if my family is relying on me. Growth and failure is privilege and linked directly to capital. Oh, we should fall down and see how it feels to get back up? Who’s paying for the doctor after that? I should sign up for insurance? Who’s paying for that? This video is incredibly in bad taste, coming from a disconnected place of privilege, and placing blame on a generation that has been handed a barren field and then scolded for not being willing to work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've noticed that Gen Z seems to be much more introspective than we millennials were at their age. The irony is that this precociousness doesn't seem to be helping them to "adult" more effectively.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It seems as though this comment section is heavily offended. Poor, poor Gen Z’s…. Let’s all through a massive pity party for us all.   Yes, the economy is hard. As a fellow Gen Z’r, I understand. I also understand that there’s record unemployment levels for lots of blue collar jobs and trades. This generation is the epitome of not taking responsibility, and throwing blame nonetheless. I’m not over generalizing, as I understand lots are struggling. I am too! But people don’t take responsibility for what they could be doing better! We are not unique in wanting a just economic system, literally the last couple generations have gone through their upheaval regarding the same thing. It is harder now; but honestly, let’s stop playing the victim cards, understand things can change, and live below our means.   She’s right on one hand. Each generation, as proved, are much lazier than the last. We’re already criticizing Gen Alpha for their laziness, without taking responsibility for ourselves. Work is a means to an end; if you’re unable to support your end, live below your means. Yes, boohoo, we don’t have the same opportunities as the ones before. There’s a point in which we just say that IT IS WHAT IT IS. But we could also be doing so much more if we were driven enough. It’s a balancing act
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I suppose the gen z whiners have a point about being mislead by their parents about how to live in American society.  Starting RIGHT NOW, parents should be advising their kids to go into the Air Force and coming out with a marketable skill. THEN the kids can get a degree. The housing problem for them could be  more manageable if they learn a trade which allows them to buy a fix-up house at a very low price and work on it themselves to bring it up to their standards. Everything they need to learn is easily accessible in Youtube videos. The whining just serves to reinforce the common perception that younger folks ARE lazy and averse to WORK.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Uncertain if this has been mentioned but given how bad climate change is I'm not even sure we have a future
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This comment section kills me. All kids just starting out have it hard. Yes, the economy sucks and it is not fun out there. I got a degree to never use it. I learned a skill in a trade and now go to work everyday to break my body down for a lifetime. Yes, shit is expensive. But I'm not just gonna bitch and moan and not do what needs to be done. God forbid y'all have to face a challenge in your life. Some people don't have their parents or family to fall back on, and are forced to go work more than one job to survive. Unless you're born into wealth, EVERYONE struggles when they're young. Get over it and go do what you need to do to survive. God forbid any of y'all have kids. You have kids, you have to do all kinds of shit you don't want to for them. Then it's not about you anymore, and you shut up and do what you can to provide for them. Many of y'all were just not taught how hard life really is. And it's your parents' fault.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Born in 1993. I have a BA in a field that does not produce jobs. I took a job as a correctional officer in a cheaper cost of living city. Within 2 years was able to buy a house. Do people not move for work anymore? Most of my friends joined the military for 4 years and it opened so many jobs for them in the private and public sectors when they left,
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the reality is... if you already been thru how it's like to depend on yourself from the age of 19 ish, you will adapt, learn and take a action by your own. yes ofc parent comes to help once a while but don't depend on it too much. i earn my income from doing freelance work. now i feel confident when approaching people, applying a job and help someone when they need something. this is why i forced myself to get in skill based college and stay at there hostel for 3 semester. from local collage to outside. i learn alot to be independent, adapt with the environment and leads anything that was assigned for.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its very clear the drift away from religion this nation has embraced. No one feels like they have a purpose because no one knows God anymore.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Jesus, millennial parents are too soft. God forbid they walk  themselves to and from school on their own. Helicopter parents or gentle parenting really is a detriment to them in the long run.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z skipped their let's-change-the-world young adult phase and went straight to midlife crisis mode
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: WORD! (Just wanted to let you know that your comment isn't unread)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So, bringing up their concerns about the current state of society about the bleak future that is ahead is considered as whining🤡😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Thechosen1000  Frankly, yes. But then, everybody whines about something at some point in their lives.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why does it piss off you older gens so much? None of this effects you?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m not religious but I agree with this. Church gave people a “built in” larger community and a sense of purpose. When I hit adulthood as a Gen Zer I knew I had to find something like this, a commitment that required me to be somewhere every week and have people rely on me to be there. I landed on leading volunteer bike rides, and socializing regularly with people 2-3 times my age has given me a lot of hope and perspective that most of my peers don’t have.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I mean we have the task force against anti-christian bias or however it was phrased, so there's that in the government
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Prayer doesn't pay bills or bring the prices of housing down. Hope this helps.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@ileutur6863 You're completely right, people need to put in the work and the USA is making it so even the work doesn't achieve a life. But its been proven through studies that societies who embrace religion have people who feel more a sense of "purpose". Something to live for and a direction.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a neurodivergent person, it’s kinda disheartening that this generation battle gives people an excuse to call you a failure for not being good at socializing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 42 and I am on your side kids. I had that blank and expressionless stare going on in the 90s. It's "I'm trying to be pleasant and polite, and you are making it *hard*"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I work in customer service and am gen z. I find it interesting how the most pleasant interactions typically are by gen z and millennials. It feels like they see us as people and not little robots to serve them
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennials were also called lazy and inept when we were coming up in the workforce. I have a feeling this is something every generation always says about the newer generation and forgets it was said about them
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a millennial ('95) who works retail, I've had more of the awkward stare from the 50+ folks than from anyone younger than that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: See the crazy part is that I'm Gen Z and have never experienced the Gen Z Stare, like, ever. Service workers don't stare off into space or stare at me like I'm speaking gibberish. Now I've DEFINITELY had older workers look at me like I ruined their day by daring to walk into their restaurant and want food, though.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I love that being awkward is seen as quirky or relatable in media, but the second someone irl doesn’t follow social norms it’s a whole issue.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am older gen z (was already in college when pandemic started) and have never struggled with my social skills. I have noticed some of the younger gen z people around me tend to be socially awkward. My problem is that the relentless shaming of the “gen z stare” on TikTok feels like high school bullying - making fun of socially awkward people without understanding why they are that way. The pandemic genuinely stunted younger gen z people and that’s not ok. We need to be looking for solutions and not punching down.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i hate being 30 and now having gone through this twice before; old ppl just want to hate the younger generations and this is just the next justification to cry about it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I worked with a lot of boomer conservatives at my last job, my gen z stare was "I can't believe you actually just said that out loud at your place of employment, but I know if I make a fuss about it I'll be considered the issue so this is the most I can do to make you feel judged for your actions without losing my job"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I always felt like the whole "i don't owe you" thing was like "I don't owe you kindness when you are being unnecessarily rude" at first and spiraled.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What they call “the Gen Z stare” I call dissociation from the horrible reality I live in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 16:52 I think it needs to be said WHAT small talk IS. As autistic person I hate totally pointless just for politeness stuff, stuff that does not allow for neurodivergent versions, but minor conversations and little interactions are what I thrive on.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think an aspect that was glossed over in this video was that the stare is often given to those who are disrespectful toward younger people because they are younger. Yes there are socialization issues, but it also applies to older people. We aren't willing to give respect based on someone's age alone, especially when they are actively making life more difficult for us
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got accused of having a genz stare once . Im autistic with hearing problems .
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I work in fast food, and ive been accused of having a "gen z stare", but im Autistic and thats just how my face is.  Im not rude to customers- i think im rather polite and respond quickly, but i often forget to use facial expressions.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as a diagnosed autistic person, this is something I’m already so used to hearing. I abide by the ‘I don’t owe people anything’, but only in situations where it is possibly harmful to me. I’m someone that’s comfortable being completely alone all of the time, but I’m nice to people because I know how much better it feels when people reciprocate kindness.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was told “don’t speak until spoken to” and “if you don’t have something nice to say, don’t say anything at all”. Personally, growing up everything I said was taken with a worst faith interpretation or I’d get cut off if I tried to defend myself or say anything, so I stopped. I then just got accused of trying to “stare people down” when I really just didn’t have anything to say that wouldn’t be turned against me. When I started working in customer service it got even worse because people wouldn’t respond to me at all or HEAR me, so I got trained to wait for customers to come to me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 2:11 I can’t believe that the same people who practically beat the idea of look at who your speaking with is now upset we look at people when they speak to us
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the fact there is a term or conversation around a “stare” says a lot about where society is now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yesss! My sibling does the same “gen Z stare” but they have autism and ADHD and r usually zoning out, they can’t really control it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠@sw3et.t00th_m3nac3I hope the best for your siblings truly I’m autistic and working with neurotypicals all day gets exhausting and when I want to be left alone people are literally asking if I’m depressed and I say no and there like are you sure yes I’m fine I just want to left alone and masking myself on top of that feeling suffocating like one of friends/coworkers asked why do I want to be alone idk bc I can’t stand everyone talking at the same time trying to get a word in and people want small talk I’m sorry I can’t join in it’s annoying and wasting my time I like my fish and plants or science anything but small talk so I’m pretty much bored bc I didn’t know people can be this so boring like cmon where is the life feels working with walking talking corpse it’s something about humans I really don’t like
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @sw3et.t00th_m3nac3 damn that sucks, but still if he can't socialize maybe just disown him?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In my opinion, this is a key factor to consider.  Gen Z is more open to neurodiversity and are unmasking more.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Claralevistudio   and yet are also more abelist. It's kind of crazy that Gen z are inclusive and discriminatory at the same time.  I've been hearing the r slur tossed around left and right, and it's just frustrating to me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Claralevistudio  I hope it happens more and more. Sadly I had an ex friend group that, despite some of them having ND themselves and disabilities, bullied me to a point of emotional abuse over my disabilities and ND just because I unmasked and got better in therapy and they were unable to.   We need more people who are healed, or at least don't get mad at people trying to heal. <3
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Claralevistudio  that makes a lot of sense, lol. im most likely autistic (have all the symptoms) and this sorta thing makes sense to me. granted, just a small smile when talking to customers should be what you do, but thats when youre actually talking to them. and i think you should be able to not smile if the conversation goes long enough. idk, to me theres a lot of "if then" statements for these situations
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah FR! Like, as someone with autism, I struggle with this all the time! I’m just naturally stoic and reserved, but I’m still pleasant and friendly.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Felt this my whoooole life (a failure) as older gen z 😮‍💨
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as someone who doesn't like to socialize in large groups or at all with strangers, I like this gen. They make the most sense to me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Unfortunately, this is a trend that I’ve seen since Gen X was entering teen hood. Both sides calling the other a slew of things based on communication etiquette and general differences in social cues. That said, the older generations are always the ones who start this bs, so I can’t really blame the younger generation for putting the gloves on.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: no literally my autistic/adhd ass is just like damn, they’re all referencing symptoms i experience(like not knowing how or when to start conversations) and hating people for it, kinda makes you feel like shit about yourself. but even then, i’ve NEVER just stared at someone when they’re addressing me in some kind of way. like i may not always respond in the best way cuz im awkward but ive never just left someone completely unacknowledged and ive never really experienced that with any other gen z workers ive interacted with
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @leo-rp1ps same if I’m being directly addressed I’m very quick to respond (albeit awkwardly or quietly) but when it comes to organically starting a convo with someone my brain is just like mmm don’t know what to say head empty just give an awkward smile and hope they get that I would actually love to be friendly 🙂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Totally agree, I find it so difficult and I really do my best, therapy, mindset coach, exposure therapy, getting uncomfortable. I put myself in situations to get over not only the fact I’m on the spectrum but struggling with panic disorder and anxiety due to being bullied all through childhood and struggling with body image. I feel like a failure when I see these things and I genuinely don’t know what to do.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People can not FATHOM people being different. Plus, this 'stare' isn't even new. Think of ALL the old movies where the fast food workers are just zoned out, zit faced teenagers. It's almost like that's what working fast food as a teenager does to people lmao  These things are a minority in people but people notice rude people, so they attribute it to the generation instead of realizing everyone can be a little off.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel the same way!! 😭. And what’s crazy is I do try my best to appear “normal” and “sociable” in public situations. I don’t ignore others, i try to match people’s enthusiasm. But I’m just not good at it. I’ve always struggled with social interactions and maintaining relationships. So being categorized by older generations is really frustrating.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Hahahaha-qd4fx same here I want a friend just doing friends stuff and being normal when I’m not is frustrating so I’m slowly unmasking myself and see who sticks around well I noticed once I start acting odd in there image people get weird around me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it's incredibly incredibly disheartening. It's ableism! and i hate it!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: same, im audhd and i genuinely have no idea when im doing stuff it just happens sometimes i make too big of an expression, sometimes i dont at all when i react to people, im not meaning anything but to let them know im listening and sometimes older people think im being rude like hello
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yea I have adhd so I usually space out often and yesterday some middle aged man was like why do you have that gen z stare which is why I looked it up and found this video
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m autistic and NEVER understood why people NEED their pleasantries reciprocated. Why do they feel entitled to your reciprocation?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @pewdrules  Social norms and cues.   Conversely, why do you feel entitled to not reciprocate social cues? Just as being required makes you feel off, normal people consider the lack of response to be a sign of disrespect.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a fellow ND person, it’s very disappointing when they care so much about socializing when they’re letting the world burn with plastics and fuel 🙃🙃🙃
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: precisely my thought - fellow neurodivergent person
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m just really socially anxious and an introvert in general tbh. I can communicate with people I’m comfortable with but it just drains me after a while.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it's way easier to have a friendly voice than to move my face muscles into a happy one.  I move my face muscles so little, my eyebrows don't move more than a few millimeters even when I try hard to make angry or sad eyebrows.  I also still look like a teen at 27. lol but yeah, putting on a smiling friendly face for customer service would get old after 5 mins lol like who could put on a performance for that long? also, I don't have to be smiling to be happy.  I don't have resting b face, I apparently have resting sad face. always get asked if I'm ok meanwhile I'm doing fantastic. if I wasn't ok I would not even be around for you to ask.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠​⁠ @Star_Rattler  That’s very interesting. I suppose always genuinely smiling at work almost necessarily has to be performative, as one cannot always be expected to be happy at a job.  I ended up writing a lot, more than I expected, so sorry in advance! I got the impression from reading that the act of smiling seems slightly difficult, or at least not easy, and it was the same for me in the past but no longer, and I wrote mostly about the progression in hopes that it could be useful or at least interesting to read about.  My mother mentioned to me years ago as a teenager that my neutral face could be very scary, and similarly to what you mentioned, I would have it even when happy. I’m not exactly sure how I came to my understanding of how facial muscles work, but I changed my neutral expression to be less scary and more… neutral. Muscles can be extended or contracted, and they lengthen or shorten based on their “training”. As in, the neutral position of a muscle is not absolute and unchanging. Take the tongue, for example. The optimal tongue posture has the tongue curved and touching the roof of the mouth, but some maladaptive postures have it flat and pushed against the teeth, which causes some facial development issues like stunting jaw development or splitting apart the two front teeth over time (I used to do this). After starting to move my tongue to the correct posture, though, eventually that’s where it rested neutrally as the muscles adjusted, and my tongue no longer ever tended to lie flat.   I write all this about the tongue because I believe the same applies to the muscles of the face. Partially, though, I was backtracking how I got to this point, as I assume learning from tongue posture back then helped with later changes. My neutral face had the muscles of my mouth almost fully extended, appearing to droop. What I changed was just… to not let them droop all the way, but actually hold them in the middle between fully smiling and fully drooping. Nowadays I look like I’m sliiiiiightly smiling. I think of this similarly to abdominal muscles, where the ideal is to slightly tense them and maintain better posture rather than allow your abs to sag completely.   Some muscles that are involved in truly smiling are involuntary, so there will always be some performative aspect to smiling if you’re not actually happy, but I do believe it’s possible to not have a scary or sad neutral face through just slightly changing posture and changing the natural resting state of muscles over time. I hope the read was at least somewhat interesting if not useful!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: especially because these older generations are the ones responsible for teaching their kids to socialize and interact with others 💀💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh, they've always done it. They're just becoming more broad with their ableism.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm neurodivergent and also an empath so I feel people's emotions really intensely so I often feel really burnt out. Also I struggle with socialisng.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @KatieKangaroo26 iirc experiencing others emotions like that (to distressing levels) is less of an empathy thing and more of a survival response thing we learn as children, we're taught to constantly monitor other people's reactions and adapt to avoid conflict within unhealthy households. Naturally this is very exhausting, and is something I also see come up a lot with my fellow neurodivergent peers, so I wonder if there is some correlation (eg. we have to make a more intense effort to read people, therefore the whole phenomenon is more noticeable) or if it's really just that we were all raised in silently abusive situations. Which also wouldn't surprise me. /info
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah it's the same stick yet more aggressive this time around.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a neurodivergent person you weren't constantly bullied for your entire life about that very thing?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a neurodivergent person, there isn’t a lot thats funnier to me than seeing underpaid customer service reps stop pretending to like people
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Literally. I have a processing disorder so bad I got hearing aids at 20. If they have an issue or are rude, I will shame them into the ground for being mad about a disability, lmao. Even if I am not mad.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have a difficulty in finding a job because of this. Now, I just try to enjoy my unemployment era despite the stress ppl around me are giving 🙃
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I often stare into the void and zone out, no idea if its a neurodivergent thing but its just what I do and I can't help it. But the way people shame others for this is pissing me off because a lot of it is so unwarranted.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am autistic and an adhder, I hate making phone calls so much that instead of calling my bank for something, I walked to the bank (no license or someone to drive me) to talk in person and it got resolved in like 5 minutes. The walk from my house took longer one way. Hell, the only person I can talk to for hours without hesitation is my best friend. Also, a funny and ironic thing, I like voice calls. Like ones in Discord or Snapchat put I don't show my face. My brain doesn't make sense.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactlyyyy. Just what I thought tbh. It's ableist ASF...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly. Not all of us are neurotypical. This is what dissuades me from going out in general tbh.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The worst part is its mostly our parents generation. So you're complaining that you messed up as a parent? Like who's fault is it?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Literally, have a stimulating conversation and my brain won’t check out for the day
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Literally. As someone with adhd, sometimes I really just have to take a couple seconds to think, which I fear may come across as being disrespectful
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: they legit said this about EVERY GEN EVER. it's just another way of boombers and fossils to make us fight amung each other while they profit off daddies emerald or oil mines
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have to control it so they don't know
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah. Glad to know I'm literally not alone in this. I'm 24 and I feel old. Have a lot of mental issues and tend to lack motivation for anything. Force myself to work a job I don't like or feel safe in. I feel like a failure for not dropping this cycle to pursue what I like because I feel afraid and believe I won't make it because of society standards.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It takes work to get good at it with or without autism
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "O.M.G. you're SOOOOO awkward socializing!!!!! 😝🤣, how you interact with people like THAT its sooooooooooooo DUMB!!!"   Thanks for pointing out my disability, Barbara, I definitely don't feel any shittier after that comment, for sure
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fr and they still prob don't believe in things like autism and adhd, they just want to call folks lazy...like no we wanna work...but when we do you all complain!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Introverts suffered in every era. Cause extroverts always feel entitled only because they are socially good.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Real 😭 like damn I’m sorry I have autism what do u want me to do
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: especcially when people keep pushing the world to be more and more on online
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a neurodivergent adult and I kinda have been told jokingly by my parents i have resting bitch face. Yeah I’m sorry my relaxed face isn’t to your liking
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah as an autistic person I do act like that because I genuinely can't help it and am overwhelmed constantly and I literally cannot speak with people that I don't know
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m not neurodivergent but I’m very bad at small talk or generally talking to people I’m not familiar with. Like the words just get stuck in my throat and I’m awkward 😭 and it really is sad to see people calling socially anxious people, failures like you’re really not making it any better or helping them to work on themselves . They’re just motivating people to keep to themselves more atp
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, but on the other hand, if everyone is socially awkward, we don't stick out so much.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same it’s really hard for me to keep eye contact with anyone
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: exactly!! like i have a really hard time socializing and i get hyper focused and literally cant hear anybody talking to me, but im really not trying to be rude :c
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As someone who has social anxiety and is introverted while also having adhd, yeah..I don't like huge crowds, and I prefer to be on my own in a quiet space...especially when it comes to trying to sit still, like I CANNOT, I need to fidget with something or I'll ve spacing out an forget what's being said.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Agreed, I'm actually generally pretty sociable I just don't often make facial expressions at all until I'm telling a story, general conversation gets nothing and I don't blame them but family members have asked me if I'm mad at them before cause of it 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeah man I try not to be irritated because I feel so drained talking to strangers like I rather not be quiet and respectful than be an a hole dude.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yessss literally I’m so bad with the Gen Z stare at my customer service job but it’s bc I’m audhd and there’s so many possibilities in my head of things I could say but I get caught up on saying the best thing and then I just say nothing and hope customers just understand my willingness to help from my vibes 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i was literally just thinking like some of us are just autistic/neurodivergent god forbid we’re not high masking 24/7 and amazing at social cues
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same. Usually it's just been a thing that affected ASD/ADHD people, but now that it's being attributed to an entire generation it feels even worse
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THANK YOU SO MUCH, finally someone said it!!!!!!!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Very disheartening. I personally assume that when I get these non interactions that the person is neurodivergent. I guess I was wrong. Seems they just hate their jobs and want to make others miserable because of it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah i got AuDHD and i feel that HEAVY
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes this this this, I've been scouring the comments looking for something along this topic before going on a rant myself, this is something that I think is an important part of the dialogue that people are forgetting or unaware of
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Being disheartened is what it means to be neurodivergent. It’s not cuz of what he said or she said. I’m with u cuz.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same. As a neurodivergent person as well, I dissociate a lot and completely fail to understand small talk. small talk is just a performance with no genuine purpose other than to dodge a potentially awkward situation.   If I’m going to say hi to someone, I want them to give me a genuine response. anything less is boring, empty, and a waste of time and energy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As someone who is also neurodivergent,even my mom still fails to understand why i blow up or have a hard time conversing or  anything so i feel this even at home
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s either I have a very expressionist face, or I am too expressive… so either they don’t get any reaction at all or they see just how stupid there question was because of my face… audhd is a blessing in a curse
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a neurodivergent person, this is not about not being naturally good at socializing. Not everyone naturally appears the same as neurodivergent people (otherwise that behavior wouldn't be divergent). This is a generation that was poorly socialized as children. The rise in only children growing up alone trapped inside a suburban house, legally mandated helicopter parenting, loss of child friendly third places, loss of independent mobility for children. This is the result of a thing we did to children, not a thing that children are or were.   It's also not the kids fault. This is the fault of parents, lawmakers, and lobbyists.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's why I like being an introvert.😂 I typically don't deal with too much of any of that. I just want to do what I need to do and get home.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They won't even try to be normal or considerate of other people's time. We're all fkn humans living in this world together but for some reason they think only their feelings matter. So you know what? You fkn  reap what you sow, and I don't feel bad for putting some slightly younger than me douche in his or her place. They still have a lot to learn about the world and they can make an effort like everyone else.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm neurodivergent myself and feel like neurodivergent people at least try. I have seen many gen z people who seem dead inside. You have to do half their job 'cause they are so slow but the moment they are done with the job they are lively again and have energy. I'm not even saying that i don't understand it, it's just that some don't care at all if their 50 year old worker has to work longer because they didn't do their job within the time they had to. Even if you say ,,well it's the fault of the company, capitalism, work culture bla bla" a 50 year old has more to lose from getting fired than a young person
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'd argue that neurodivergent people have an actual reason to be that way and those who aren't neurodivergent shouldnt be using you as a shield for not being polite.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It seems like all the kids that have been using computers have “adhd” and are on the “spectrum”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: if you werent masking and just authentic, accepting yourself, you wouldn't care and you would be pleasant. the not being good mostly comes from anxiety and misperception so just be yourself.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: God made you in his Image. You are perfect. Does not matter what others think. Big hugs from Europe. ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: All this talk of ablism, as though other generations didn't have to go through the same kinds of things.   As a Z-lennial, I was originally rather introverted. I couldn't do job interviews, but ended up getting a job as a TOUR GUIDE due to a family friend. It took time, but I learned that being able to put on a mask is both socially applauded and financially beneficial.   The difference is that I actively tried to get better and learn invisible coping strategies, whereas the "Gen-Z Stare" is typically done by those who find comfort in claiming mental illness and claim anyone attempting to help them integrate into society as "ableist bigots".
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z has turned psychology into astrology no most people are not neurodivergent you just never socialized and are socially awkward.. work on yourself
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yea and you’re not neurodivergent because of screens, social media and lockdowns like most zoomers are. They have social and developmental delays because of this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Then get better at it. I have ADHD and I have no problem as a physician. Either learn or be a bum who feels bad for themselves and a person who can’t contribute to society
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oddly enough I disagree that this is ableism. I feel like a lot of gen z do the gen z stare not because they're awkward and don't know what to do, but because they're annoyed and they think they're above communication to stupid or weird people. They're sure fine socialising when it's time to go back to their peers and complain about the interaction.  They do this to neurodivergent people too so I don't feel any sympathy. For neurodivergents who are bad at communicating, these types of neurotypicals who just HATE communicating are the worst because they're the ones expecting you to get these minor cues and know unspoken rules and they get annoyed when you make a misguided effort to communicate which takes up their time  Sure, this convo will bring out underlying ableism in society, but I think at least the original videos were just calling out straight up antisocial behaviour and not awkward behaviour. Sitting there and gaping at someone with a flabbergasted, annoyed expression is rude. As sad as it is, most neurodivergent people would learn the hard way that this behaviour doesn't fly and we would have it drilled into us at a young age. I also really don't think any neurodivergent person who was truly unable to tell that this behaviour is bad would make it past the borderline evil application and interview processes and make it into a corporate environment
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That excuse comes in the form of calling yourself “introverted” which is just an excuse to not improve your social skills
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: grow up then, or did this issue only exist the past 5 years?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @key-bumps LMAO it’s not simple like that. That’s basically like saying “you have autism/adhd? Well just DON’T have it!” No, it’s an uncontrollable thing. You can learn to manage the traits better, but they don’t just go away. Socializing is always going to be harder for neurodivergent people than for neurotypicals.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You're not neuro-divergent. Grow up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@SuperStella1111  is 27 grown enough? I have a car and a job and I pay taxes. pretty sure that's nice and grown. oh and I have adhd and autism and those brain disorders are considered different (divergent) from the normal brain with no disorders so im PRETTY SURE like probably at least decently sure that makes me a neurodivergent adult.... but who knows idk maybe like the several doctors and psychologists that diagnosed me and medicate me but like maybe all 5 of them are frauds 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SuperStella1111  what do you think happens to children that get diagnosed with ADHD and autism they grow up. they become ADHD and autistic adults.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is what i like to call the "waiting for you to hear yourself stare".
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The good old "I am being civil. I am being VERY calm, I am one step away from making Ted Bundy look like a triage nurse, do not mess with me."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I really think it's older generations just trying to find something lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Highly anxious millenial and stg if I gave a blank stare (which cmon let's be honest it's just the disaffected teenage/young adult stare, stereotypically for the 80s and 90s it was the "I'm bored and too cool to talk to you" thing) if I gave a blank stare it was because I was trying not to hyperventilate while an entitled elder tried to hold me personally responsible for something I literally have no power over because you fully believe "the customer is always right" so if you think the price should be lower just for you because you don't like it, somehow that means I personally have to make that happen and I can't   Got news for you buddy the customer isn't genuinely always right, it's give them whatever will make them stfu and leave. You think I'm happy to be here and I care about the company? I'm stuck here because I have bills to pay but I hate this job, struggling to find another one and I hate dealing with people like you, I'm severely depressed and it's taking everything I have to stand here and politely take your bullshit so sorry if I'm less than enthusiastic to be kissing your ass
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @CuratrixBriar It is "Customer always right about tastes" anyways. They forgot the ending
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @CuratrixBriar fr dude!!! That’s exactly it man I’m just trying my best and everyone is exhausting
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I honestly think it's mostly a teenager thing. Like they will let you know when they think you're stupid, no matter what generation they're from.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Jacob-ps5xl as our brilliant and well-spoken generation would have said "Uhhhhh. No doy"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Dude, 43 here. GenZ is like 100% Daria vibes, am I right?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The "customer service persona" but you dont get the smile, because WHY ARE YOU PUTTING SECONDS OF SILENCE BETWEEN EVERY WORD LIKE IM 2 YEARS OLD AND AN ALIEN.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ok I am a Gen Z actually a young one I was born in 2012 kids this generation are rude as hell all of us are in middle school not a single kid I have talked to never has not talked bad about someone or mean
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Lilly-c1p That's middle school and the first 2 years at least of high school, no matter what generation you are
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No it’s not the same. A lot of times the wouldn’t even bother to say anything. People in the past was annoyed and still do their job and communicate like a normal person.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @joeblack7262  how did you know that? Did you live OP's life? Maybe think before making generalizations about a life you didn't personally live.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @joeblack7262 Unsure if you’ve noticed, but we left “the customer is always right” era and moved to the “FAFO” era. People are starting to realize they don’t have to put up with nonsense. Respect is a two way street, if you say something crazy don’t be surprised when people look at you like you’re crazy or refuse you service. 💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No it’s really not. They’re slow. They are the guinea pig generation that was the first to grow up with social media and 24-7 screens. We didn’t know what the long term implications of this would be, and we are now seeing the results
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Arginne  and why exactly did those kids grow up with social media and 24/7 screens? Who exactly allowed that to happen.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Arginne  maybe yall could've done your job in being PARENTS then? dont call young mofos the "guinea pig generation" when it's primarily the people who didnt want to bother raising their kids.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Arginne  And this response is exactly why we look at you like that. You do not respect us, we do not respect you. You are not owed respect because you're older. that is Bullshit.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ive noticed that too. People closer to my age give me more respect than the elders.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @cremepuffle Right, it's the older people that act so entitled and crude. It's the younger people that have more manners, saying 'yes ma'am' and 'no ma'am,' and just treating me with respect. This is from experience. I've literally had older people throwing tantrums or just cursing me for mistakes they made on their order. I literally have to take deep breaths and give myself pep talks when I see an old couple or old woman coming my way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: real!!! When I was working retail, millennials were the ones who treated me with the most grace, more than older gens, maybe even more than my own gen z. Not all certainly lol, but mostly that was my experience.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: True. I’m older gen z and when I worked at dunkin, it was always the people around my age that would be very pleasant to interact with. The older folks could be incredibly rude and entitled and the younger people struggle to socialize, which I get, I’ve been there. This also isn’t to say that the older or younger folks can’t be pleasant people. But you’re right, it did feel like I was valued more when I have customers around my age.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @aangranaa younger gen z over here- I agree. Even now, as I’m looking for work, or just being around more age groups than when I was a child. Life gets different everywhere as you grow. I’ve met extremely nice older people and had long conversations with them, even joked with them before, while also getting some of the worst interactions with people around my age. But flipped too. But I do seem to have better interaction with people closer to my age or not far off from it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a gen z myself, I agree. Most of them are just chill for the most part and I always get pressure from older people.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you!! The most unpleasant interactions are the one's of the elderly. Nothing against them, because I've obviously have had interactions with them that were very sweet and genuine. But a lot of them, particularly, the one's that believe they deserve this special treatment.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @crazy-h4n  to be fair, even without generational differences, if I’m 50+ and have to work in a Starbucks (presumably because I got laid off or came on hard times, or life just didn’t go in the direction I wanted it to) I would also be pretty jaded
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Completely agree! They're always more polite and in general more of a vibe. I was always happy to see them because I knew it would be a polite and respectful interaction 😭. Like, yes finally my people.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Many of us have worked in customer service too, so a lot of us understand what it's like to be behind the counter. I always approach someone in customer service with an apology "Sorry to be a bother" because I am. I try not to pester the service works for things unless it's important and I know they're busy doing 100 billion other things. Funnily when I get a bag or leave a cashier I always leave with "have a good day" because I'm just so used to ending the interaction with the same line reguardless of which side I'm on. LoL
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a millennial the feeling is mutual. Most older folks I work with (even the ones I'm in charge of) approach me like they expect respect automatically but I have to earn theirs which is quite aggravating. Most of the younger ones approach me with respect and expect it in return, that's so much easier to work with.  Don't get me wrong, some of the younger folks are a pain in the ass and some of the older ones are awesome. But for the most part I find Gen Z to be easier to work with
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@JayTopDawg buddy since I've been in construction I've met a bunch of gen z who make mistakes and then attempt to learn better and a bunch of boomers who make mistakes and then twist themselves into pretzels attempting to blame others for their mistake.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So true. Although sometimes I would meet an older lady who would call me sweetheart or honey and it made my day
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: With gen Z I either get lovely people or just a blank stare. Milennials tend to be really nice too, and old ladies. The old ladies are nice until they aren't, though, and then they REALLY aren't.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @collin3150 my partner works at Panera. She had this regular lady that was super sweet every time they would take their order. Then one time they was on production instead of order taking and their co-worker who’s a darker skinned Mexican was treated like dirt by the regular. The lady made a big deal about the order taker needing to stop mumbling, and adjust their attitude. They legit started berating the worker at the drive through window. Because my partner is the team lead she instantly stepped in. The lady switched from being a major Karen to acting all sweet. Old lady’s can really switch up at the drop of a hat. Especially if they get a worker who triggers their covert bigotry.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Literally! The only one of my regulars that isn’t rude is this older lady who always orders a large unsweet tea with no ice and pays using a gift card from 20yrs ago that she keeps reloading. I love her and we always have a small chat. Sweetest lady in the world.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, I think the biggest thing is people expect retail workers to be upbeat and super helpful but also don’t want to be bothered by the workers when they are looking. At the same time the companies expect their workers to be pushing sales and it just makes it awkward to try and have a conversation with people who don’t want to talk to you and you don’t actually want to talk to.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes!! Also being in the south, no one has emotional regulation so it's always scary telling bad news to customers ( especially dudes over 35) coz they walk up all calm and smiles but then out of no where blow up in anger 😬
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a millennial and also work in customer service and some of the most polite customers ever are gen z. It's unfortunate an aspect though is that they are often so apologetic for needing something when I'm the one who asked if they needed anything. Much of that is simply knowing how difficult customer service can be, being harangued by customers.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Before switching careers i worked in restaurants for years and witnessed some of the worst customers humanity has to offer. Anyone who claims gen z are the most entitled has never served a table of baby boomers at Applebee's. I feel for you guys.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm glad most millennials are pleasant to you guys. We experience the work force and a lot of us did customer service, so it would piss me off if most of us were behaving the way Gen X and Boomers treated us. It's nice to hear that some are still being empathetic to what you guys are going through and don't treat you like robots. Being kind to workers goes a long way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Some kind in drive thru asked how much our five dollar box was, and it didn't matter. Young to old we all stopped, and we all gave each other 'the look' Some giggled, and others sighed in annoyance.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a millenial and I would definitely rather interact with someone my age or younger. That way I can just do my thing, they can do their thing, and we can get this transaction done with as few words as possible. It's nice that way :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am gen z and I have never worked customer service, but I know how hard it is so I try to be nice. even if it's just a polite greeting and a "have a nice day" when I leave, there are so many people who are rude and I don't want to be one of them
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennials lived through, growing up and often in service positions, the way that companies coped with the 2008 crash - hiring a smaller workforce, all part time, and overloading them with work and without giving them any benefits. We see how these same companies continue to treat the worker very poorly. We know what this is like.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same here (Z in retail), Zs and Millennials are far nicer customers
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: probably because most of them recently joined the workforce and freshly understand the pain of employment
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Because they’re the ones that understand. We’re the first generations to have to deal with the “karens”. Back when boomers started working, if it was a customer service job people at least had modesty and a retail or fast food freakout was very rare. Now it’s like every other customer you get and it’s partially due to how terribly the system is set up these days.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's because you ARE people. You're doing a shitty job, dealing with shitty people, because bills HAVE to be paid. I try to make any interaction with me as pleasant as possible for customer service workers. That way, if they have a day of terrible calls, my call stands out as a customer that still saw them as a human being and not just something in the way of getting what I want.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Because we were treated like chite by gen x and boomers our whole youth and we know the struggle.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Millennial who's dating a Gen X... yeah 😆  Seriously though, I find Gen Z really easy to get along with. I think it's because Millennial is the generational divide where we kinda broke free of that whole stupid "I drank from the hose and beat my kids, and I turned out okay!" bs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I tried when I was a cashier for a cafe. Got yelled at by my boss for being vaguely casual over the phone taking an order...it was wild.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Literally. Like yes, I haven't worked a job yet, but I see it with my own eyes with how she treats those especially in fast food. Like I get secondhand embarrassment when she does it. Like one time there was cheese on her salad from Zaxbys (and she did never tell them no cheese) and it's like calm down like seriously. Then another time she was rude to a lady on the phone trying to help her very nicely with why the movie didn't work on her TV (she has Direct TV and it was one of those on the banner things in the guide). And both times the people were super nice, and it just gives me straight up secondhand embarrassment. And she's also one of those people who if you're not doing it her way, you're doing it wrong even if you were doing it correctly. And she's called me and one of my cousins (which I used to dance till I was in 10th grade and my cousin who is dancing currently dancing her 2nd yr) hypochondriacs because we both feel joint pain (my cousins knee was bothering her and me I'm always in back pain since I pulled a muscle in it and both my knees hurt every other day/week) and it's just frustrating.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a younger millennial I like to think it’s because we’ve grown up with more similar conditions. We got the internet growing up. Social media. We’ve got the same jobs and housing problems. There’s more empathy from the downtrodden to others in similar conditions. Who can afford housing on a single outcome without it eating 50+% of their monthly income? I sure can’t and I’m considered (barely) middle class in my state! Shit sucks which is why empathy and community are more important than ever
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 3 years of retail. I 100% agree. Ive never hated my life more than at work. My only joy is genz customer so we can talk to each other like people and hang out for a few minutes
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Must say though that even though iPads didn’t exist at a time a lot of kids where still shoved onto other electronic devices like ds’s and tamagotchis and PlayStation portables, placed in front of the TV etc and that’s another reason why Gen Z are socially awkward. I mean it’s still happening today, look at all the parents getting their little kids to watch Ms Rachel, they’re learning the wrong pronunciations and grammar, when they’re older they;l definitely be iPad or some electronic device kids that are socially awkward unless they’re arguing about something because the awkwardness goes out the window when we’re arguing about what we think is right etc
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s because we are chill people. The old are just getting bitter and conservative !!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i as a gen z person do my best to always be polite even if they get my order wrong and we need a do over. its really not that hard to be nice and understanding, so i dont understand why the older generations cant bother with this basic stuff, smh... even if they dont have what i want, or i have to go to a different place, it doesnt mean i should get angry at them and think of it as an insult toward me as a customer, thats not fair. i will ALWAYS be upset that my grandfather is a karen toward customer service workers. he is infuriating, i just wanna shut him up and apologise to the service workers but if i did he would be EVEN MORE UPSET. do they not understand that being nice to the service workers benefits you too????
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Isn’t “serve” in your job title.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Isn't your job as customer service to "serve them"?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @BethWilliamson-k2d do you like being treated like an emotionless prop? They treat us like garbage by that same logic
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was very socially anxious for much of my youth, I also had that internal main character b***** that most of us have. As you get older and get over yourself a bit more, and get your mind off the internet and become jaded like the rest of us. You'll find it's actually easier to simply be pleasant, even if it's not how you feel. Really only your parents and significant other care how you feel, and even for them. It's probably for the best to deal with your own problems and not dump them onto someone else as if we are not all human working through our own things. I am millennial, we were spoken of the same way you guys are now, just as you will speak of the generations which follow you. Your youth is fleeting and is almost never appreciated. Express gratitude for what you have, give when you can, and you will find fulfillment. My friends are mostly Gen x or gen Z with just a few other millennials. No, the customer is not always right, but the phrase doesn't exist because it's reality, it simply makes things move along like greasing the gears. Of course, none of us are paid enough to deal with problematic idiots, but you know what gets the problematic idiot out of the store faster than staring at them or starting a fight? Just nodding along with their b*******, giving them a pat on their stupid little head, and then sending them out the door with the product or service they came for. Just remember, only the wise person knows they are stupid, embrace your limitations, forget your parents lies that you are somehow God's gift, and let's try to make humanity a little bit more comfortable and safe for each other and those who will follow after us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm gen z and have many great interactions with older people! Most of our customer base are older people and most of the time they have a story to share which I enjoy. I have had a few unforgiving older people but there's always people like that no matter the age. I feel like people my age are definitely less social which is entirely fine and I have social anxiety too so it makes sense. I find it's usually the people from mid 20s to 30s who seem to be the most sociable or have the friendliest demeanour and body language where I work! p
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How do you know which generation every person you talk to belongs? Are you asking? I mean the youngest millennial and the oldest Gen Z are like 1 year apart.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @xjojie  Visible age, and rough age groups that people fall into. You don't need someone's exact age to figure out roughly what generation they're from.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @xjojie It's not a specific divide between the two imo. I just feel like younger people will have more understanding for other younger people just like older people usually take the side of and understand older people better.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That’s ironic because I’ve thought  sometimes the young servers treat the customers like robots.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @joeywic  joey, they just got done with dinner rush, there's three different radios playing at the same time in the kitchen, and your server just got screamed at by the other table because they put cheese on the  cheese burger. Have some grace, they're overwhelmed-- not trying to be rude lmao.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @joeywic well maybe don't act like a robot or be rude to customer service people and you won't be treated that way if its more that one place/ person treating you that way then im pretty sure you should be able to recognize the common factor in all of those interactions is you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @joeywic  A hyperrational capitalist economy, that's build around shareholder value and not community, does that to people.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you didn’t treat us old heads like NPCs,  you might see a difference. It goes both ways, Brayden.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @uncanny_valley_girl bruh old heads don’t even respond when u greet them it’s like they finna go into the light right then and there like imagine having one foot in the grave and just being just hateful for no reason
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @uncanny_valley_girl  yall are just mad because being old isn't an automatic "respect" token for yall anymore.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @uncanny_valley_girl  ironic you said that why don't you look back at your last idk 10 customer service interactions and if you yelled at any of them for anything less then nearly killing you bc of a food allergy you made them aware of then I think its you that needs to reevaluate how you treat people
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There are newspaper clippings going back a century of people saying the same comments as each new generation enters the workforce. Its part of the human life cycle at this point
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @banana_na  I’ve seen them. It’s true
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Aristotle called the next generation the same thing...that was back in ancient times.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: True. The trend you also notice is that none of the previous generations whom are alive feel the responsibility either accountability to guide and assist newer generations.   Seems there’s only profit in arrogant asshole behaviour.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Imagine what is going to be like when Gen alpha joins adulthood
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @NomadicIndo  That's a take straight from the internet, with a huge negativity bias.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its true, its been like this since history has been recorded.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This.  You should have heard the crap they said about GenX.  They call us GenX now, but originally they called us the Slacker Generation.  Also, back in the 1980s and the 1990s when I was a teenager/20something, I too talked a lot of not owing anyone anything.  This is a normal phase of growing up and is not unique to Gen Z.  You all will figure it out, don’t worry so much about what other people are saying about you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: cusper here! and yeah i experienced the whole "millennials are lazy and dont want to work anymore" and now i'm hearing the same thing about gen z. i think ive seen this film before
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @DannyViTaylor oh you poor thing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THIS PART!!!! I’m so confused how quickly my fellow millennials have forgotten
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a millennial and I had a boss “jokingly” tell me my generation was handed everything and we are lazy… I was in my 30s and a top performer when he said that, I don’t think we’re escaping these accusations in our lifetime.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And that didn't come out of nowhere, that's the first generation to start taking real advantage of workers rights, which made them work with less effort, I don't find this to be a bad thing but older generations didn't want to accept workers rights because it would be admitting they were abused their whole lives and they don't want to do that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have yet to hear of a generation who's parents didn't claim that they are "difficult" and "lazy".
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its just a projection of the trauma that they endured from the previous generation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They don’t forget, rather no longer connect to the younger generation. They believe “enough” is different that this time, it’s actually true. Like their generation was special under special circumstances that are totally different than this new generation. “Yea, but we were changing the world,” “yea, but we were all in college,” “yea, but we all had rent to pay,” and these perspectives tend to stick even when they’re aware of why these differences exist. There’s no more Woodstock to “change the world” with anymore. Colleges are too expensive to go to for many. Young people don’t have the credit scores or enough pay to actually afford an apartment on their own. And somehow that doesn’t matter. The new teens and adults are always “lazy and socially inept.”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It 100% is. Its a never ending cycle
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i feel like some millennials are excited to finally be on the crusty, "hate the next generation for being kids that are in a different decade and raised in different environments than us" side of the world
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Of course it is. As you get older, the more ownership you feel you have over the culture and customs, and when the newer generations do things differently, you feel you lose some of that ownership.  In the core of it is the feeling that soon you might be living in a place you don't recognize, feel comfortable in or have agency over.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i feel like its retaliation in a weird way "We were told we were [insert negative thing] so you guys need to experience it too"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nah, it's not that we forget, it's just that young adults are inept at first and maybe not used to the work. They're basically kids. We were basically kids, and it's totally okay. It's part of growing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @MasterMemo you obviously did forget otherwise there wouldnt be a trend of older generations calling us dumb and lazy. Or you just have no empathy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @MasterMemo  okay great, yeah, that's not being disputed, but that doesn't change the fact the older generations shouldn't be insulting younger generations for doing the same shit they did, which was the point of the original comment. you intentionally lack reading comprehension and that's kind of a you issue
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @MasterMemo  no, most of y’all genuinely do forget bc I’ve had way too many people lecture me for being Gen Z and making all these assumptions yet the moment I ask what they were like at my age they go silent bc it dawns on them that they’ve got no room to talk. Someone being a young adult doesn’t make it okay to hate on them or bully them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There's a reason I try to have empathy for gen alpha, because I know gen z in the future are gonna prob mock them for being CHILDREN very soon.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think you're right, the Silent generation and the greatest generation (two generations that literally annihilated their generations by going to war) had the Boomers, and called them dreamers. Gen X was called slackers. As far as I know, Gen X doesn't really care, whatever happens, will happen. That is except for the Karen's out there. Nobody understands the Karen mentality. Got side tracked, basically, I think it was the generations that went to war, that thought all the younger people had life easy and made everyone know it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@The.A.I.Palette People forget that Boomers were the hippie generation. The older gens HATED them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeah, the only reason it's 'memed on' now is because we turned it around on the boomers and turned it into a meme.  like how yankee doodle dandy started as a joke making fun of colonial americans and they just embraced it and it became a proud song instead of something that made them inferior.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It is...and is exhausting....as a millennial I refuse to play into 'generational wars'...is giving i don't want to accept that I'm getting older so I'm going to hate on the younger generation. We need younger people with new ideas so we can keep om growing as society. I hope that Gen Z also don't go after Alpha and let this trend die. BTW I apologize on the name of the people on my generation that are being AH...seems they don't remember how annoying it was when were the ones being attacked...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Plato wrote complaining about the youth of his day, saying much of the same.  It's been going on forever.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a 30+ year old millenial, I've been called lazy by boomer bosses because I respected the schedule and did my job without going above and beyond (they were borderline dead-end jobs - an upgrade meant more responsibilities without a pay increase). All I have to do to convince myself they're full of bs is to look at their lives (they spend 7 days a week at work, from morning to ~11PM - I don't intend to meet this standard ever).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Because the goal of progression is obviously to make things better, simpler, more easily accessible, etc. so when each next generation comes of age, older generations whine about the world they chose to change in the first place! They want better for their kids and shit, but get mad and pissy when things get better because they “have it easy” 🙄
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennials were also called the death of so many industries and products. Like we made avocado toast into a meme, but it was a straight up insult at first.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: True and gen z is alrd hating on gen alpha lol I'm gen z btw lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think it's worse, they do it because continuing the cycle makes them feel better about themselves.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: millennials ruining bell industry by texting: I am here 😡😱🚫🔔
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The gen z stare? You try being the only person in customer service with a line of customers and none of them are prepared for their turn.   They always have "a few returns" across three different receipts that they spent five minutes digging out of their purse. A lot of the time it's not even the receipt for what they're returning. Then comes the: "I bought these at the same time!" And when you can look up receipts by card, it turns into "I only use this card" while I just saw you open your wallet in front of me and saw ten other cards in there
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 100% it's what every generation goes through. If you haven't heard Baz Luhrmann's song "Everybody's Free" aka "wear sunscreen" you absolutely should. It's full of bangers such as -  "Accept certain inalienable truths: prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too will get old, and when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Let's be the first to break the curse. I can't see Gen-Z being nearly as evil as boomers. If we even get to have another younger generation here in the West, they are in for much harder lives than the ones we grew up to.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: exactly and gen z has alr started saying things about gen alpha
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I always tell my spouse that we are not participating in "generation smack talk". As Millenials, we were called the worlds worst generation right as we were finally considered adults. 18-23. ....we literally had no time to grow and develop ourselves.   We aint gonna play that game with Gen Z or Gen A.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING. Every generation just repeats. Now we just have a platform to talk about it. Like everyone is on about how gen alpha this and that......Do you know what kinda weird things gen z was seeing on shows and repeating it most likely or how most shows before 2010 use to talk about the gaming addiction kids had for games coming out or phones or whatever??? SAME problem with addictions to their ipads and all just in a different font meanwhile they come online to talk about like they aren't addicted to.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Still sitting in my safe space while waiting for my participation trophy. 🥲  Seriously though, it's almost like... young people have an underdeveloped work ethic from being new to the work force.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I literally watched the public perception of 'the lazy generation' switch from Millennials to Gen Z in real time.  From 'Avocado Toast' to 'Why don't people want to wok anymore'  It's always a very loud minority of an older generation trying to sew anger and resentment in our fellow human.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I can't wait to say it about Gen Alpha! I'm so excited!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennials ruined all sorts of industries, including the housing industry. We are childless weirdoes ruining the population numbers.   The "Millennials are cringe" thing is just what younger generations think of Millennials, not what older generations threw at us. My uncle to this day blames Millennials for random stuff.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh it does it's been happening from the dawn of society 12 thousand years ago. Right after the comet hit and wiped out civilization. :D 2029 baby ready for the tunnels already.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its exactly that, we all have something as a generation, be it by technological advances or cultural/political changes, that marks and impacts how we act
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You're correct, there are ancient stone tablets speaking about the younger generation being lazy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I literally took a test in my business class and one of the questions were what’s the difference between millennials and gen z..the answer was   “unlike millennials, gen z approaches adulthood planning to work for success”  Dude what?? That’s a matter of personal opinion and it’s not even in the book.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It technically IS the case. But for a good reason.  The older generation both had better paying jobs AND the world wasn't as miserable in their eyes.   It is just hard to have the same enthusiasm they had when they where in the work force when the circumstances are so poor in comparison.  Back then life goals where mainly "Find a partner, have a big family, suck up everything else". Now that the standard was demolished, things have changed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @rompevuevitos222 And they still did the exact same "*sigh* I'm not paid enough for this" thing everyone in these positions still do.  But I bet you most the ones doing the complaining use 'burger flipper' as an insult or threat, and haven't worked that kind of job before. Boomers have massively disrespected the entire minimum wage sector of work since they were young. The most insane customer service perspectives seem to come from people who have never been in even a parallel position.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Even boomers were treated like this rebellious generation that doesn’t care about rules and traditions
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oooooh, yeah they did do that to millenials didnt they? You're right 🤔
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennials "ruined" all sorts of industries, including the housing industry. We are childless weirdoes ruining the population numbers.   The "Millennials are cringe" thing is just what younger generations think of Millennials, not what older generations threw at us. My uncle to this day blames Millennials for random stuff.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Really old fart, here .... This is the same soup, different bowl ... About every ten years! 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen X were “slackers” according to the Boomers.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a rule of thumb, society gets better and better with each generation. For whatever reason Older generations find it annoying when younger generations does things they didn’t have acces to or does things to improve their lives that goes against previous norms. Often we see society gradually improve with each generation but each generations improvement and sucess are often labeled as ”problematic” by the Older generations I.e. The gen ? Is lazy/ other problematic or bad thing    This is a gross generalization of a statement and does not represent each individual or even a majority of people it’s more akin to a trend within certain internet communities and groups
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Suure, sure, and all those teachers quitting because of the newest generation are just being dramatic and entitled, right? All those mental health issues are just made up, too. There's no problem with any generation, let's just embrace them all... and all the mass unaliving that's going on right now in the US. It's all fine. Everything is fine.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @odsasadolasa1  you do realize the newer generation isn’t Gen Z right?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: LOL im sure sooner or later we'll say the same for gen alphas lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh, the news articles hated us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It really is just a cycle of each generation calling the next incompetent. You see it with millennials critiquing gen z for their childhoods for example and gen z doing the same to gen alpha
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And Millennials proved the detractors correct.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m sure we won’t be like yall. Gen Z is not like other generations. Most millennials are as far gone as Gen X imo. Some of the young ones chill but eh. Technology makes the biggest difference between generations now. We actually see the faults of the world and economy and aren’t blinded by the pressure to “succeed”.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Huh, What does a stare/expression have to do with work ethic?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @UpQuick  it doesn't, but they'll find a way to make it have something to do with it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Older millennials kind of are imo… sorry… As a younger one, I used to think my older cousins, siblings, peers were immature and cringy, and I didn’t want to act like them. I still think that. Maybe it’s just an every ten years thing. Maybe every ten years the younger people just cringe at the older ones no matter what?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The difference is we entered the workforce at a younger age, thus the awkwardness was seen as "more acceptable"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @joanjones6882 Be for real, most young people nowadays (I’m talking 15-18) have a part time job, or at least summer works.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @joanjones6882  I know multiple people that started working and being payed under the table as young as 10 and its not exactly uncommon where I live for anyone over 14 to already have a job stop acting like your generation did anything special compared to any other generation smh boomers are so out of touch with reality
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nah, millenials had a personality the last 2 decades. Gen Z expects everyone to carry the conversation for them. It's exhausting. Just wear a hat that says I can't talk, my brain is off. 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @xjojie  it's possible people just don't want to talk to you particularly <3
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @xjojie 1) tell me you’ve never talked to gen z without telling me 2) on the off chance you actually have talked to gen z, if you’re carrying the conversation it’s because they don’t want to be talking to you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @xjojie i’m genz and consider myself a conversationalist, maybe you’re generalizing based on your own experience.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s really bad with Gen Zs though
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ifyoureadingthisitstoolate544 Nope, just as bad as all the other generations.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @ifyoureadingthisitstoolate544 it’s almost like we grew up ina pandemic so we couldn’t develop social skills
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ifyoureadingthisitstoolate544  well it’s also because there was Covid lockdowns, then people were being stupid and gen z was locked in the house, then when they got out of the house people changed more and they couldn’t do anything and then older generations started criticizing gen z more and more because we couldn’t grow socially then we started seeing all the bs and hated it, not going along with it, then we were called lazy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nah, theres something specifically off about gen z, they aren’t fully socially there. It’s beyond the usual generational differences. I blame the rona dem-party lockdowns. That really messed them up it’s wildddd 😮
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @xandercrew6088 Of course you blame dems as if Trump wasn’t the covid president.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @xandercrew6088 wasn't trump in power for covid?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @xandercrew6088 wait until you realize trump’s horrible mishandling of covid during the first year of the pandemic is the reason we were in lockdown for so long while the rest of the world moved on way quicker than us
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm sayin'!!! Don't stare at me weird because you can't figure out how to use a card reader at checkout!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah. I work in retail and the people that ignore me the most are little baby children (who were not TAUGHT to speak back to people) and older people. Gen Z are honestly rarely the ones to do that to me. I also think it’s important context that I live in the south. I’ve pretty much always been taught politeness culture. So the fact in my southern town that it’s an issue with older ppl is crazy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@sondreadavis9203  Yeah I see more "lead paint stare" than i do "gen z stare"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @sondreadavis9203 I've had experiences with older people in Southern setting like that. They just acted all snooty or like I offended them by not complimenting how they breath. I think that the "gen z stare problem" outside of dumb questions or being tired, is just Gen Z having their customer service persona locked in and people expect genuine happiness and excitement about them entering an establishment. I have no idea. Im Gen z, but I've never heard of this Gen z stare until recently.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same! The only time I’ve experience or done that stare is in a group setting when a question is asked cause we all pause not knowing who is gonna answer. Like for example when a waiter asks a questions so we all pause to see who speaks first lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @sparkyboomboomboi7051  And that's when you need the Mom Friend to either start the answer chain or look at one person and ask, "Do you know what you want?" and that'll start the answer chain easy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: To be fair you should've been less hungry
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Rightfully so! How DARE you enter a place that sells food 🤬
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also, the 'stare' is just when people yell at you for eye contact, so you make eye contact
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just feel like alot of people subconsciously hate kids and teens and view them as nuisances and bad thing bound to happen
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ve never experienced it, not Gen Z. But, I wouldn’t blame them for dissociating because they’re suffering. Especially service workers. After COVID people have collectively become worse.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've definitely zoned out while working and kinda stared off but I'm usually talking with them as well so, but I'm an older Gen Z borderline Zellennial
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: same!! never had this happen to me before. they don’t stare off into space when i talk, probably because im polite & straight to the point and small talk is annoying
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @veri.contrary Exactly! Life is so much easier when you get right to the point and know what you want when you get to the counter. A quick "how are you?" is the max I'll do if it looks like the cashier is a "how are you?" kind of person or they ask first.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @veri.contrary  that's just rude though- if someone asks me how I'm doing, it feels nasty to jump to "cappuccino" and ignore what they said
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s because we are speaking the same language funnily enough, it’s totally a cultural divide in terms of how we communicate. A millennial saying something that we would think is stupid or cringe due to the difference is what warrants the stare. I’ve had it a few times from when I’ve been ragebaiting my friends or girlfriend. I honestly had thought it was just a common way people express disbelief or being done with a situation but apparently it only is a gen z thing. I think we often communicate with it but it is just normal for us so we don’t think oh that’s the stare
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I mean the crazy part is that as long as you’re polite and don’t cause a problem any of them would be nice and decent to you, Gen z or not. I’ve encountered very few exceptions where I felt slightly uncomfortable, but that might just be my autism and crippling social anxiety.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @cryptid_cactus  Damn right lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Probably cause you arent stupid 😂 ive ALWAYS been the type to just stare at a mf when they ask me a stupid question or genuinely have the audacity to DO obvious dumb shit in public. Like WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! But i am not gen z. I just hate stupid 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am a millennial and have never seen this so-called Gen Z stare. I have seen it more in younger Gen X, Darias whole thing was her disaffected stare.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same, I’m older Gen z and I’ve literally only seen the stare online. Never in person in my 4 years of being surrounded by Gen z people at college or while I was working retail or when I’m with my friends.  The closet I might have gotten to it would be when I was a cashier and people would say things so baffling I genuinely didn’t know how to respond for a minute. But even then it was intentional uncomfortable silence, I just genuinely didn’t know what to say.  I’ll admit I don’t love small talk (like talk with no purpose at all, about the weather or something). If you ask me “how are you doing” I’m like to answer the truth, regardless of how well I know you. I think asking questions expecting nothing but a polite “good, you?” Answer is completely meaningless. I also don’t necessarily want to interact with service workers. I think they do a great job, but I didn’t come into the store to have a conversation with the cashier. Usually I’ll try and smile or saying something really short and final like “it was fine, thank you” to discourage conversation cause I’m not here for it.  But yeah. Like I’ve never seen this happen irl. Only ever seen people complain about it online.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same, I've never experienced this "Stare" in all my time working customer service.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's cause I'm intentional and trying to get through the transactional interaction efficiently. The old people try and make it more than it should be for no goddamn reason
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like I get that “I hate that you’re a customer” stare from any age, but that might be my own insecurity projecting onto them 😂😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just remind myself that majority of these conversations have ZERO to do with us and are NTs learning basic decency and a lot of self realization.   We, on the spectrum folk, have a tendency to hear these general conversations that aren't meant for us and make it about something we're doing wrong. Remember, we have super powers lol, that's what we've had to tell ourselves to cope with the difficulties that NT society has created for themselves which was all the worse for us.   This is not about us 🫶🏾🩷
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've worked with at least two Gen Z coworkers who did the Gen Z stare as default while working customer service. It was actually really fucking funny, since these two would never do it because of a negative interaction. One just had a bad attitude all the time, and the other was awkward.  That said, I've worked with a lot of Gen Z, since I work fast food, and those two are the only ones I can think of who did it. Stereotypes are almost always incorrect in my experience.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yea, I went to this yarn store for some hasty and impulsive purchases, and there was an older woman in front of me in the line. I could see the "gen z stare" on the face of the cashier as she was in the middle of this pretty obnoxious and annoying rant about something, but when I was next up, she was perfectly pleasant to me, lol.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bruh I work in a cafe right the only time where I have the “gen z stare” is when it’s dead and there is no customers 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's probably because you treat service workers well!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They also over exaggerate the stare cuz I’ve never seen any of my coworkers stare off like that for as long as these boomers say. It’s just a quick glare usually when they say something stupid
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I mean... I've been guilty of throwing angry stares at customers but that's cause they give me a bunch of other jobs to do other than making food, I work in a gas station deli. Also it's whenever im by myself for like 2 hours
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a young gen z I also don’t experience the stare. I don’t really talk to people much, and when I do it’s usually a “thank you” “have a nice day” “you too” or a compliment that took me the whole interaction to work up the courage to even say.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think it's because we're also Gen Z and we don't annoy the hell outta the employees lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: old ppl have been rude ash and wonder why nobody wants to speak to them about the weather
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I didn't know it even existed until the internet I'll be real. As in never heard anyone talk about it or tell me I'm doing it. I also know like a ton of Gen Z people that don't behave like this at all. This is definitely another weird 'let's criticize Gen Z for no reason' moment manufactured by older generations that want to have a problem with younger people. Funnily enough, it always backfires on them too and ends up getting their own age group in hot water.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: a service worker gave 20 bucks once
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Dude same, I’ve never done nor experienced anything like this. 21 and I had no idea what this was til I heard this from my sibling, “….I did the Gen Z stare…”, like, WTF even is that?   Just call it “dissociating from reality” because that’s what it really is
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Probably because you actually live in real life and not on tiktok like this guy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Right? Like, im sorry that my body's needs for nourishment and hydration have so greatly offend ye old wise one...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ive only encountered one “Gen Z stare” while I was working and I was giving this guy his order and he just like stared at me like he looked like he was in a daze, no blinking, no thank you when I handed him his food it was kinda weird ngl. He was a continued customer too and thats how all of my interactions went with him
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have gotten it a few times while being gen z but it's like 1 in 500 people I might talk too
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Me too! I walked in and waited about ten minutes because this older lady was on her phone, not even looking at me, and when I finally tried saying “hey” she paused, stared at me, and went “we’re about to close” in a very monotone, “get tf out of here” voice. They were not, they were an hour and a half before their closing time… I never went back.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The only time I’ve given the gen z stare was one time when I was walking home from the post office and was on my phone, and walked by a neighbor who I’ve literally only had 1 negative encounter with who proceeded to say “no don’t look at that! Look at me! 🤣” like grandma if you weren’t a jerk I have no problem smiling and saying hi to you, I looked back down at my phone for the sole reason that I wanted to avoid interacting with specifically you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I experienced someone older than me (a millennial because I’m first-year gen-z) give me the gen-z stare at Newark airport when I ordered a Starbucks coffee. She just looked at me like I was stupid the entire time I made my order lol. I said “Hi, I’d like blablabla” and I felt like an alien from outer space 😂😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i have… (as a gen z) now that you’re paying attention to it i promise you’ll see it more cause a lot of gen z just don’t respond 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The Gen Z stare is when you ask them something and they literally blank out and just go uhhhhhhhhhh  Like the reason they're judging you is not because of the staring, it's because of the fact that you get asked where the sugar is and then you mentally start shunting your engine 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ve gotten the gen z stare before as a gen z , but just once, and it was kinda my fault but nothing serious. I went in this pastry shop and it smelled of roasted garlic. I was so hungry for whatever I was smelling in the air I just said “it smells like garlic” and the gen z worker was like ??? LMAO
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This might be a generational cultural difference. Like something you interpret as the person being angry you came in might be something that is them just emoting in a way that was normal pre internet, and what the older person sees as rude from Gen Z might be something you see as normal.  A lot of what people are talking about is nonverbal communication and yall do just sometimes have a different affect than older people which is okay its just different.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@frankenstein_and_myrrh There was another instance of this a little bit ago where older generations complained millennials(i think it was them) use "no problem" instead of "youre welcome". Older gens thought millenials were implying they dont want OGs to ask anything of them since they "werent welcome" to a request, while Mills are more obsessed with "not being someone else's problem" hense they say "no problem" because thats what they want to hear, that their request wasnt a problem. Cultural differences between generations
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @frankenstein_and_myrrh no it is definitely anger LOL they speak on it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its more of a “how dare you be the reason why im getting my paycheck” like
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Regardless of whose staring at you- Gen Z or older, what are you doing that warrants bad looks? I've never gotten that from anyone...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Really? My experiences are the opposite lol. Everytime a service worker is young, they act like they are doing me a favor, not as if they are being paid to attend and help me. Not all, though, there’s a lot of them who are nice and genuinely sweet/friendly, but some will not even say "hi". In my country, where friendliness is the norm and otherwise you are considered rude, is a bit upsetting when I smile when wish them a good day and they just look fed up. I also perceived that these type are always laughing with other workers, but if u try to ask them something, they look like you committed a crime or something LOL
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ive literally only dealt with this from the younger half of genz and younger but i honestly think its because a lot of yall have bad parents and even if you do have good parents you dont listen to them. I'm not gonna act like all of my generation is bad but I'm also not gonna act like we aren't just blatantly worse. The majority of yall say and do things that the older generation didn't because they'd get knocked out. Stop the cap yall this is pathetic
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like this is one of those things that works if you're hot and doesn't work if you're not
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @idontwantahandlethough  one million percent
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like it's their social norm. But Gen Z has partially different social norms. Like being respectful and not screaming at someone, because they are not doing what you want, right that second.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: omg that already happened so many times with me, so I feel ya ❤️‍🩹
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's only quirky if it's unique. If everyone is doing it then it's just common and annoying
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like it also matters if it comes off as rude or not. You could be socially awkward and just be seen as a little goofy. A lot of people are interpreting the stare as rude.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @audreyoberg5931 rude is in the eye of the beholder tho. Some people think that a certain vocal intonation can be perceived as rude, but they could just have a flat affect or be neurodivergent.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Social media romanticizes the idea of being awkward
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well I mean media isn’t real life so there’s no point in brining media things to real life but getting mad at someone who doesn’t understand social cues is dumb ngl
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think you just feel awkward characters are relatable because you are awkward yourself.  I never heard of awkward characters being "relatable", at most they are "charming".  Talking as someone with some strong social anxiety.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @rompevuevitos222 nah, a lot of people say awkward characters are relatable. Is a really common thing.  I am socially awkward, most likely neurodivergent, however this is related that character that struggle with social interactions are found relatable to a lot of people, not just me or just the person who struggle really hard
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m not the youngest Gen Z comes but close to it; I’m 15. I was at the end of my 4th grade year when the pandemic started and ended up barely being able to do anything for 2 years. Minimal interaction with people in general, but especially little interaction with kids my own age. Beginning puberty at that time definitely didn’t make things easier. Even when we went back to school, we couldn’t sit next to each other at lunch and had to have at least one seat between us. I became so introverted and opted to go back to virtual schooling (which I did horrible in). Not to mention, many Gen Z are raised BY millennials. How are they blaming us when they’re the ones raising us? Lmfao, maybe teach your neurotypical children how to interact with people better and it wouldn’t be a problem
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@tofinilith_ Im older than you, somewhere between the oldest of gen z and the youngest millennials. I had already had time to develop my social skills before the pandemic and still found myself backsliding. Idk how i would have handled it if i hadn't had the practice beforehand.  Good luck friend, i hope it gets better for you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @tofinilith_  I'm a few years older, 18, so the pandemic started when i was near the end of 7th grade. My 8th grade experience was ruined, which in my opinion, is an important part of someone's life in terms of social skills and responsibility.  I was just 12y/o, then went back, straight into highschool, in person, at 14y/o. I still felt like I was 12y/o. It wasn't until I was 16 and 1/2 years old that I started to actually feel like I was my age. The pandemic really fucked all of us up, honestly.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @tofinilith_ I can relate to this. Not many friends, homeschooled since Covid (which I think is roughly six years) and now I’m going to college and thankfully there’s hybrid classes. I can hold a conversation, just  awkward, especially around people my age. Strangely, I have no problem talking to older people.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, I think it really effected(affected? Idek anymore) people who were at that like.. key stage of social development and stuff with other people(because I was in late 4th grade too and got fucked over) since when you’re little-little it’s very important to interact and start understanding what’s going on around you(I think) and a big event with lots of isolation like that can really impact those littles in the long run which is quite unfortunate.   This is just what I think, ofc. I’m not a professional or anything- just using what braincells I have left guys 😔
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Cosmic_Katia affect. Affect is like influence. Effect is result. For example, cause and effect
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It feels like they blame us for the pandemic honestly. And really the world outside has become a much more hostile place to interact anyway, so there are a lot of gen zrs trying to get through the day without being needlessly yelled at.   It's a weird phenomenon.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: fr, I seen a millenial also getting upset by what other millenials are doing to gen z and myself had made a similar comment about how it feels like millenials were finally given the green card by the popular fake group that consists of boomers and gen x only to get jumped on by immature millenials somehow saying it's "our fault for bullying them years ago and should just accept that this is payback🤪🤡" which was strange and very confusing, like who were they talking to that did that to them? cause it certainly wasn't the kind of group I was with😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: right? The pandemic severely affected me, and I'm not even a kid! It was a very stressful time, I can only imagine what it would be like to go through that in your formative years
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also the only way for them to get batter is through these awkward interactions sometimes as they learn customer service skills
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as an older genz who works with younger genz teens, they do notice the cues more often than not. they’re definitely not as socially awkward and we do have to remember covid fucking happened too. they’re doing pretty well despite being isolated for a year from their peers during the most important years of their lives (not going to school in my late teens killed my social skills too) but with things like the genz stare it really is them just knowing they’re being spoken down to and acting accordingly. people speak to these kids as if they’re stupid or useless right off the bat. no fake social kindness from these older millennials and boomers, you can hear the judgement in their voices and you can see why they act that way. ofc sometimes some people just struggle but most just don’t wanna deal with disrespect and respond to it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im also older gen z ( I was a senior , 17 , when quarantine started ) and I’ve always been socially awkward but that because i have major social anxiety which i was able to control a little bit by working in customer service from early teens to even now . definitely agree with you by saying the younger gen z are extremely socially awkward be then again we don’t know what they’re going through as people . especially with how much online bashing gen z as a whole gets in general ? I wouldn’t be comfortable in public either .
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It probably feels like high school bullying because Millennials (who are on Tik Tok and are the ones complaining of this there) had a very bad problem with that kind of bullying..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This might be the case for some, but for me,  I was in middle school at the time, I had the best time at home, away from everyone else, yet when we returned to school, I was oddly more extroverted lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was 13 when the pandemic started and before that I already had problems with school and a lot of social problems....(Probably because of my parents divorce when I was 8 which made us move out to a different city and that I also changed schools 4 times between the ages of 8-12.....) So I think it's safe to say that the lock down really messed me up lol 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Covid is a REALLY good point. The pandemic started as I was first going to high school, and it really affected my ability to socialize with classmates let alone strangers. And I feel like pandemic affected most of this generation's mental health. It took a lot of effort (and some anxiety medication) to get comfortable enough to talk to people. It still affects me here and there and I'm starting college now. It messed a lot of people up...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im 20 and I was socially awkward long before the pandemic and I shall remain that way long afterwards
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yess! Thank you!! As someone who is neurodivergent (AuDHD) and struggles with social anxiety (plus anxiety in general), conversations can be really tough sometimes, I have auditory processing disorder and that “gen z stare” happens when I genuinely don’t understand what is being said, sometimes I need the person to repeat themselves or just need a second for my brain to catch up and process what’s being said, so then I can answer appropriately and contribute to the conversation lol  I’m not dumb or “socially awkward” per se, my brain just takes a minute to process, especially on bad health days or in crowded environments with a lot of stimuli… 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm solidly a millennial and I am pissed that other millennial are perpetuating this bullying. I remember the relentless articles of what industry we'd killed and how everything wrong was our fault. It sucked!   I do think the social issues need to be addressed,  but making crappy meme videos isn't the way to do that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: While this is definitely true, I feel that for me at least and some other gen z’s i know, its less that we can’t and more that we choose not to.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What, a gen Zer said "punch down"? No way, that phrase isn't trendy at all.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This part! Even the lady at 20:50 had me cringing a bit with her tone 😬There absolutely is something to be said in regards to the social skills (or lack thereof) in gen z, especially the younger ones - but the whiny, shaming attitude that this issue has been mostly handled in is just... unhelpful, to say the least.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Strong agree omg, when someone is looking like theyre staring in fear or stress, the last thing that will make a change is to react with rage? like what they expect??
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: See. It is not so fun to be "judge" according to your internet generation.  It's just ridiculous, in my opinion. I think it more comes down to the phenomena of "self fulfilling prophecy". Others see what they wanna see and nitpick on it, because the concept of "alphas" and "gen z" is just made up, either way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am currently 14 and was around 8-9 years old at the end of 3rd grade when the pandemic hit. It was really hard for me to socialize during online schooling. It’s still affecting me now, in high school. (Note I am one of the youngest Gen Z)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: real and it's especially difficult for neurodivergent people imo. i was 14 when the pandemic started and at the time had undiagnosed adhd and autism. i already struggled alot with socialising with ppl, it wasn't that i didn't know how to, but i wouldn't pick up on specific social cues and would often times say or do something that made whoever i was talking to think i was being "weird" or "too energetic". i had plenty of friends, but interacting with strangers or other kids at school always felt like a test that i hadn't studied for. then i (along with, well, everybody) had to go through being isolated from other people for like two years with my only means of communication with my friends being online. it makes complete sense that ppl in my generation, especially neurodivergent ppl, would find it harder to socialise and become more awkward after the pandemic. i also think that in general, fights between generations are pointless. everybody from ever generation was a teenager at some point, so everybody was at some point rude and awkward towards older generations. i'm sure eventually gen z is going to be making the same complaints abt gen alpha. it's ridiculous and doesn't actually help anybody when they actually might need help
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THANK YOU FINALLY!!! We were locked up during our pre-teen years and had no one to talk to IN REAL LIFE. For me my autism makes it worse
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm very socially inept due to a variety of factors, including childhood abuse and neglect, mental illness, and social/emotional disabilities. So yes, it's definitely very off-putting when others criticize me for my social failings. It also makes it very hard to work on those problems because it makes me hate myself even more than I already do. It's incredibly difficult to be a kind, functional member of society when you feel like the worst villain the world has ever seen.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Genuinely sighed out of relief to see an opinion that isn’t just “gen z was born stupid and bad at their jobs 😂😂😂😂”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same here, but I was in my last two years of high school during the pandemic. I would say my social skills are pretty good tbh, but I'm also incredibly awkward in conversations and will often resort to the 'toddler talk' of "Yeah, Mhm, Yeah i get it, Ooohh,". Like buddy, I'm trying to end the conversation. LET ME LEAVE.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Older Gen Z too and I never really understood the pandemic to begin with. Everyone I know who had it just came down with a massive cold  same for me. Our politicians literally played social experimenting because of a fucking flu. Thankfully I live in Sweden and we never had lock down or some stupid shit like that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Social awkwardness and rudeness are hard to spot without confusing the two but i personally have seen rude Gen Z type behavior before, and it rhey were socially awkward they just look rude to me, and ive been there myself. People told me I looked rude and I adjusted. Gen Z kids just dont wanna hear it, because they think they shit rainbows and know shit no one else knows
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SlipperyKnives  That, or maybe Gen Z wasn't raised to put up with bullshit, there's absolutely no need to smile all the time, and people who get offended by somebody not being happy and bubbly all the time don't deserve any kind of smile more often than not.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Idk if im the only one who is tired of people in my generation asking for understanding and respect but not feeling like they need to return it in the slightest but craps getting old. Blame your parents for not doing better
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bruh yall kept making fun of other generation and no one has ever called it bullying before.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yes!!! and thats literally the natural human reaction lololol its crazy how this people get upset when people simply REACT to them being disrespectful and weird
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm not genz, but I do this too. "Haha. It didn't ring up so it much be free." Deadpan stare
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i work at an hvac shop at a school, where people teach classes. The head teacher and my boss told me multiple times that he knew for a fact that Obama wasn't born in America and that the IRS is trying to send armed agents to people's houses. I genuinely have no fucking clue what to say after that other than just stare
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: YES! THIS EXACTLY LIKE.... WHAT??? It's either due to someone being out of pocket or asking really dumb questions when the answer is PLASTERED in front of their face
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Right? Where did older people's filter and social awareness go? I know it didn't get a retirement package and flee to Bermuda. It's like they forget about "time and place" because their age grants them pardon from basic, public decorum and etiquette. Yet they want to trash on someone for wearing a strappy bikini at the beach, or dying their hair green and blue, or getting face piercings, or something...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That would literally make me make it my job to hold them accountable
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It spiraled on both sides. Nah, if someone is being rude you don’t owe them kindness. But if someone is just being normal or slightly off or they ask a stupid silly question, y’all do owe them some level of base line kindness.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @hello7032 you do realize that silence is that baseline right?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nah, some people do use that phrase to be rude, insensitive, and socially/emotionally irresponsible willy nilly lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Which is understandable because people started getting hurt by it because they felt personally attacked by someone not kissing their feet and apologizing despite them being rude
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly like the "customer is always right" older generations took the phrase "customer is always right in terms of taste" took out the last part and use it to be rude to service and retail workers
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is the first time I’ve heard “I don’t owe you kindness” but I suppose I’ve been similar in the sense “you don’t automatically gain my respect.”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think it was the “I don’t owe you anything” kindness or not.   Yeah, none of us owe each other anything but it doesn’t help to not do anything when you want to get something. That typically requires some level of social interaction.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @mariachi3217 everyone deserves basic human decency unless given a reason not too, we absolutely owe each other kindness
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i still think ppl don't owe each other anything tho
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly. I thought it looked like dissociation in the majority of tiktoks shown here
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fact 😭 like this is baked into my mental health, and unless I get regular therapy, it's just gonna get worse no matter how hard I try to 'deal with it'.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not to say I hate talking to people cause I love to converse with my peers. The world is just a hostel place. You never know when someone is gonna snap at you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For me the worst part is that small talk often feels like punishment for being polite. Recently I said hello to an older neighbor and he started a pretty long session of smalltalk. I get that that's normal for neurotypical people but tbh I felt like running
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm not neurodivergent but if someone talks abt something I don't care abt i just turn off my brain and answer "haha" "that's cool" or if I don't even want to have a conversation i just answer in the shortest way possible to give a hint that I don't want to talk. ofc i do small talks with someone close but to a random stranger I'll only be seeing once in my life? nah
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'd 100% rather talk about the complex lore and themes of my favorite media than the fucking weather. What's frustrating is whenever I try to engage in that sort of small talk with people I get straight up IGNORED. I'll try and get my mom involved in one of my interests and she'll tune me out, it's frustrating. What's the point of starting those conversations when others don't even care to listen or engage?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The small talk often leads to more interesting conversations, it’s like when you automatic write, eventually it triggers the imagination in the brain and leads to more interesting topics. Anyways for me i see it like that, so dont mind small talk too much. Also if I like the person or if they’re a stranger makes a difference.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeah, small talks don't need to about traffic or the weather, like, there's more interesting stuff we can talk about.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hate that too, for example at work I get messages like "Hello, how are you?" when they just want to ask me to do something, bro get to the point just say Hi then tell me what you want damn
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Like, talk about something interesting. Fuck traffic, what're your thoughts of the state of hatzegopteryx as the heaviest creature to fly?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @CATel_ Fellow paleontology fan??? :D
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@CATel_  Small talk is a random topic to keep things not too awkward. How am I supposed to guess what matters you're interested in and actually KNOW about it? Sometimes, people just don't care or haven't heard of things you like.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i am as well but it is a part of being in society and most people are only doing it to try and make a situation more comfortable its hardly done out of malice
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Okay, but socializing is a 2 way street. Do you think maybe neurotypical people feel more comfortable with small talk? I don't necessarily want to talk about the traffic down on 1st street, but it's a neutral topic that we can share with literally anyone. That's why small talk exists.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @TrueImmortality  NT: so, traffic huh? my autistic self: ... y-... yeah? it exists?? that's how small talk about traffic would go with me, specifically. small talk is BS.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @TrueImmortality  so you want.. neurodivergent people.. to accommodate and support.. neurotypical people..? good for you that you're more comfortable with small talk, but the world is already built to support neurotypical people in every way. me personally, talking to people physically drains energy from my body, especially when i'm overstimulated by a public place. even just a simple "hello" or "how's your day" would drain like 20% of my battery and make it so much harder to get through the day. sometimes silence is needed to recharge, even if that makes you a little uncomfortable.. god forbid. this doesn't mean i never interact with or greet people, i just have to be more sparing and aware of where i put my energy. if i run out of that energy, you're gonna wish i stayed silent because my tone will sound like i hate you even if i don't mean to. i agree that as they said in the video we shouldn't demonize and altogether avoid small talk, but i don't think we should demonize people who aren't as easily capable of or ready for it either. i get the point you were trying to make but it came off as more about you and your comfort than society as a whole. i also get that not all of gen z is like me and i think we in general need to step up and start being uncomfortable more often, but as a neurodivergent person it really irks me to see people grouping us in with people who solely refuse to partake vs us who can't.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @TrueImmortality the problem is when you deviate from the "normal talking points"   i don't mind small talk personally but every time i try and engage honestly, the conversation just ends because the other person genuinely doesn't know how to respond to an answer that isn't the one they expected. i wish it was just simple as me being off putting so i can have an actual answer to why this happens but sometimes its just a "it is a nice day especially for winter. going to the park would be nice wouldn't it" that ends a conversation.   honestly its just easier to just not say anything if you're only saying something to be polite. that way no one needs to think of how to end a meaningless conversation yknow.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And they ALWAYS say "well you didn't give me basic respect" AS IF THEY WEREN'T DISRESPECTFUL FIRST?????? It just frustrates me bc I see other Gen Z people have totally normal conversations and interactions with people, but the second someone gets disrespectful, they stop interacting bc they know it's already gone off the rails.  Literally had an elderly man tell me and my coworker that we could move out of the country if we didn't like Trump. He absolutely had Medicare, and I know he was affected by the law that was passed to diminish his benefits.  My respect went out the door that very second, but I guarantee you he thought we were the problem. I feel sorry for him bc he voted for his own death. But did I get snotty and rude? Nope. I just stonewalled the convo until I was done checking him in and smiled politely when I told him he could have a seat.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @CyanFairyWren Exactly. They believe respect goes one way only. But respect, just like responsibility, is about community and reciprocity. Gen Z are tired of being told to respect people who disrespect them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @CyanFairyWren they really think they're entitled to respect because of their age
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @CyanFairyWren  Medicaid was revised to exclude illegals.  Medicaid is for the poor and illegals and it's Obamacare.   Medicare is what people over 65 have that they paid into all their lives.   Medicaid is the free stuff that has the cutbacks, but the only cutbacks were to make sure you were a US citizen.      You NEVER want to be on Medicaid.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly! Yes. But they are blaming us, which only makes us annoyed and the "Gen-z stare" at them or whatever. Yes, we need to work on normal communication, but the older generation needs to work on not being "I'm older then you, you must respect us!" Like bro, no... if you aren't going respect me, then I ain't gonna respect you, and definitely not if you're gonna be belittling!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @MarkieGraveshell I’m Gen z and I work at a place that has a lot of high schoolers bc it’s a good first job and this one girl idk what I did but she gives me side eye, I tried being yk social by saying I can’t wait to go home she looked me dead in the eyes and said no one’s stopping you then walks away like damn man I’m just trying to be nice. That’s just two examples, idk what I did to her but she does not like me. So now I hit her with that stare of yeah whatever just stfu so I can do it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This right here!! I’m one of those in-betweeners who always gets calls a millennial by Gen Z and a Gen Z by Millennials and I have ALWAYS said this. We get told to respect our elders but where do we get any respect?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: EXACTLY!!! It’s often a reaction to disrespect and abuse from someone you don’t even know. It’s actually a great tool to deal with people who are trying to upset you. Just give them nothing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im 41 and have an 11 year old son who i try to teach to be respectful but not automatically submissive to his elders and if he gets treated disrespectfully he's free to exit that interaction. You wouldn't believe the amount of shit I get from others for teaching him this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Personally I'll give someone respect no matter what, but best believe I will rip that respect away real quick if they get an attitude. If I say we only take credit or debit, NO THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE TAKE CASH. the amount of times I've had to explain this hurts my brain.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i was waiting for this, i dont agree that you have to be friendly to disrespectful people in the workplace, or anywhere else. if you arent going to turn up as a customer that is well behaved, i have no reason to put my all into your experience, that you have already chosen to ruin for yourself by complaining about every little thing. i think also the older generations seem to (some of them) behave as if they have never stepped foot in a cafe before, and never spoken to another human being before.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @scarlettyoungytyou’re just mad that you have to socialize that’s a you problem
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes or they are super inappropriate and think they have that right just bc they are older, im a 19 y/o girl and I regularly have millennial, boomer and gen x people just put their hands on my shoulders, knees, back, like COMPLETE strangers and expect me to have no problem with it and when I do it's all "you kids are so disrespectful these days" like no it's disrespectful to put your hands on someone else without their permission, but I have genuinely been harassed and cussed out for telling someone not to touch me like God damn lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yessss I usually do it to disrespect.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh absolutely, my boss does so much illegal shit yet she gets away with it cause we're younger. Customers being assholes to us cause we're younger. It's so awful, if someones going to not give me respect then I don't want to give them respect.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: See, as a food service worker, I offer respect and a smile to every customer, regardless of age (unless they're wearing a certain red hat), but so often, I'm not met halfway. Usually, it's Gen X or older that doesn't meet me halfway, and when they don't, I stop putting in the extra effort. Don't want to reply when I say hello and ask how your day has been? Okay, now we're down to strictly business. I won't waste my effort trying to please you if you won't receive it. I've never received the Gen Z stare, but I have received the nursing home stare.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't think that's just a gen Z problem, this has been a thing for multiple generations. I have definitely not been treated greatly by older people. Think the worst one was when I was out as a guide for a blind person with epilepsy and some old lady demanded I make space on a bench and later on the bus for them since they are old. While my client was seizing in the chair and I was the only thing keeping them seated, giving first aid. Basically told her that she can either go sit in a none handicap spot or call the ambulance for me cause my client wasn't doing well. And they went off to take a seat, someone else had to call the emergency number.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: YESSSSS. It's so difficult to find other people who think like this, especially in a midwestern, rural town full of old people. So many older people think that younger adults and kids should revere them for their age or something, but they wanna mistreat younger people like they chose to be born within the last 30 years, and its a crime.  It's crazy, honestly.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also, over half of the examples I see online are literally just people looking at someone while waiting for them to finish asking their question and then answering a said question. Like did you want them to cut you off to answer your question?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So why is it that yall do it during every interaction? Sounds like a big cop out to me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @SlapshotJack  If they do it in every single interaction with you maybe you are the problem and not them. Have you ever thought about that? I'm a Millennial and I've never experienced the stare but I'm also extra polite to service workers because I know that they deal with rude, disrespectful, self important and belittling customers every day and I'm not the most important person on the planet. Maybe try to be nice to them, not waste their time and nerves and you won't get the stare.  Additionally: many people, especially older folks, often use the argument of "The customer is always right" to explain why they can do whatever they want and the service personnel has to smile and nod but that's just half of the quote. They leave the important part out. The full quote is "The customer is always right when it comes to taste." Big difference.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @SlapshotJack  if you're getting this in every interaction with a gen z person.... Bud, that is the biggest self report I've ever seen.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SlapshotJack  sounds like a you problem
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Excuse me for briefly breaking up this little echo chamber. The topic was about common decency not rude old folks. Hopefully when you're O.ut L.iving D.ummies you'll understand why it comes with a base level of respect.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @b1gS0Wh4t I don't think you understand the topic. They were talking about why they give the stare, and it's because people are rude and disrespective to them. Coming into a topic critiquing rude and disrespectful behavior, with rude and disrespectful behavior, speaks of a lack of self awareness that goes above and beyond. Check yourself before trying to check others.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You know, that reminds me... I have audio processing issues and it takes me a second to understand whenever people ask me to do tasks at work. (Especially since I work at McDonald's and there are a LOT of loud background noises) I won't get what they're saying at first and say "what?" But as they start repeating themself, I'll understand and just walk away to do whatever they told me to do.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same don't process sounds well in loud spaces and I am on the spectrum. Legit don't get what people are talking about sometimes, but once it clicks I'll be fine.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i'm also autistic and hard of hearing. that hard of hearing is something my coworkers know about but don't understand. i genuinely lost count of the amount of times they've gotten annoyed at me when i don't answer them. like you're either trying to talk to me from across the store or trying to talk to me as you're actively walking away 😭😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm sorry man. I know the feeling I'm just glad that people are more honest about that now because I used to have to mask very hard or get written up. Adding the fact that I'm black on top of it it would always be interpreted as having an "attitude issue"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @autumnasters  UGH, I am so sorry you had to deal with that combo of ableism and racism. People suck. I hope you have a better surrounding now. <3
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I worry about being accused of it too for that reason. I've never seen the stare in Gen Z, but I have seen long pauses in older people that could be taken that way. for example I'll be cashing someone out and they'll be looking down at the card reader with their card in it, and there's two buttons on there asking if they want to confirm or cancel payment and they'll just stare at it even when I tell them to press the green button
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have ADHD, and I have Auditory Processing Disorder, or I at least experience a lack of comprehension involving people talking to me or other sounds (especially in music) because it sounds like mumbling to me. And sometimes, I just have to sit for a second and process what I'm being asked. I also show little to no facial expression. In fact, I asked a friend once to watch my facial expressions that I think I'm making, and he said that he didn't see a difference lmao. Basically, I always have a poker face, no matter with what I'm thinking, feeling, or trying to show.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @crazy-h4n  Feeeelt. I am the same, hearing aids saved me. But most people cannot afford them and that needs to change.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @crazy-h4n literally same! Ive had people tell me that I dont care enough to remember what they're saying or listen to it, when I just cannot comprehend what is being said to me, and I struggle immensely with retaining information. Like I can, and often do, forget things within seconds of hearing, seeing, or reading it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: EXACTLY i commented abt this and i thought i might be reaching, glad to know at least im not alone in feeling this way as another autistic person
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Glad I’m not the only one. I work overnight and just… get into my work. I focus on what I’m doing with my body and my brain instead of my facial muscles, and so I have to ‘turn my face on’ when someone talks to me. On the spectrum myself, so I’m thinking that’s part of why.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Litterally so real I have audio processing problems so I stare for a moment before I respond to the question
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @gummirwl  Same! I have an auditory processing disorder AND a language processing disorder. It takes me a minute.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This!! I actually think neurodivergence is a huge factor in the “gen z stare”. I mean with many neurological disorders being genetic, it would be more common for gen z to have them than previous generations, and we don’t have as much social pressure on us to mask our neurodivergent traits as they did, so they are much more apparent with us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Real, like for me forcing myself to emote just feel weird or come out as awkward. And often I have my parents basically saying I have a resting bitch face and would often tell me to smile more but in the end I'm still polite and try my best to answer anything that they ask. Yeah sometimes I'll smile but those are usually genuine ones. Not just used to put on show cuz I know damn well if I force a smile it'll come out weird.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Totally agree! Everybody thinks I’m just mad at the world or just plain sad. Even other Gen- Zs 😐
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeahhhh, a teacher once said. "don't look at me like there isn't a thought behind your eyes and listen" now I notice how people's smiles drop when they see my normal facial expression, like I am sorry but you aren't entitled to my smile lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @PersonTP  Starting to think this is the whole "American toxic positivity mindless smiling always required when outside" thing. People overseas have mentioned this often. So, the "Gen Z stare" complaint might just be an indicator that that culture is changing and the older generations keep holding onto it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @PersonTP  Literally. People act so entitled to neurotype superiority, and I ain't having it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is what I'm saying, as an autistic millennial the blank stare is just my default expression. It's mine, y'all can't have it! 😆
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don’t think your face should concern that. It is none of their business. Really.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 3:18 to be honest, if someone at the bus or train station approaches me and asks how am I doing, I would react the same. And I'm a millennial. Well, I'm Eastern European too, so...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: same i have to remind myself to smile otherwise i look angry apparently even though my face is just resting... masking constantly is exhausting lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I still don't know how people make this a problem. You're there to get food not to nitpick at a worker's face.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Fleta_Maughner especially asking for someone to remove 15 items off the burger when the burger only has 7 and asking for something that was a Christmas special from before the server was a thought when it’s mid summer.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "I'm autism mamm/sir, do you want your food or not? I'm not top model no need to stare at my face for so long"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same. Also I'm just so tired and burnt out all the time I don't have the energy to smile and be super cheery for every customer. Also if  you've been feeling sick or had a really bad day where bad stuff had happened you're not gonna be in the best mood at work. People need more compassion for people working customer service like there's so many other things going on. Personal life, stress at work, neurodivergence etc
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I straight up don’t hear anything if I’m visibly paying attention eye contact makes me deaf and stressed
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For real. Honestly this is just gonna be another trend to hate on autistic people, even by other gen z.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: same, i dont naturally smile and i dont realize either, so my face usually looks disinterested when its usually the opposite. im not trying to be rude this is just how i look
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @thedanopgaming9521  same here, and i also don’t naturally make eye contact, which makes people think i’m distracted when it actually just helps me listen better to not think about eye contact :(
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yep, I’ve been told all kinds of things too. I’ve had people write reviews where they said I was robotic and had no personality. I’ve had someone ask me to my face “what is wrong with you?” Apparently, the only reason for this was that I wasn’t giving good enough small talk I guess. I always thought I was being polite. Even my manager always called me the stoic one, I didn’t think of myself that way until that job. And I was always the one person having meetings about how to improve at the register. At this point I just can’t do customer service anymore, for my mental health.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I relate cause when im tired my rbf comes back and i get so embarrassed when people remind me its back😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i wear a mask to avoid this! (also because I'm immunocompromised but it really helps with the facial expressions) when people cant see what your mouth is doing, i feel like it helps a lot. i have a great customer service voice and have my script down to a T but i know i make faces that i cant control. a mask really helps. but then you'll get the people saying "why are you wearing a mask cvid is over" "you know cvid is fake right?" "covd is like Hitler" (I've heard them all) so it's kinda lose lose but
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same! I also do that when people are talking to me cause I can't focus if I look at them directly, and also often just genuinely am still processing what they said (auditory processing issues). I feel like this "gen z stare" is often just neurodivergent folk
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel this whole comment section. I've always seen myself as a cheerful, enthusiastic, if not slightly stubborn person, but my resting b face and general lack/misuse of expression and tone in conversation has granted me the reputation of a genuinely mean spirited person, especially to those I let my guard down around; eg. my parents and siblings. It's been devastating to learn that my disorder has caused and continues to cause harm to those closest to me, and I'll probably never know when or how exactly it happens. It's horrifying to feel so out of control of your actions and outwards persona. I truly value kindness more than anything and just want the best for everyone.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My boss's mom came up to me one day while I was in the shop.   "You look very... disgruntled."  "No, I'm just autistic." And we laughed and moved on. Grateful to work with understanding people.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Who in their right mind goes up to a worker and tells them they have a gen z stare?? They‘re insane😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes! I often forget to alter my facial expressions while talking and I like to let my eyes wander when I'm excited about something because apparently, staring at someone unblinkingly while I'm gushing about my favorite animal (sharks) is considered "creepy". My mind is literally built different and I have to be hyper-aware of every single microexpression and tone to make sure I don't insult someone while trying to remember about my own expressions and tone WHILE still trying to focus on the topic at hand without over-sharing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I realized I have notes upon notes of “flat affect” from doctors because I do in fact forget to use facial expressions when I’m comfortable. I also kind of dislike how my face looks when I do smile. Being polite and kind should be enough.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: SAME! I'm autistic and a server and I forget to smile all the time and have to be reminded. I'm not trying to be rude by not smoking i just forgot to 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yep. Grew up hearing "what's wrong? are you sad?" from teachers, friends, and family members.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Me too bro I kinda sit there with a <:] face all the time Even when im genuinly upset i still do that face
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This!! I work at a small coffee shop and apparently a bunch of the older regulars (usually older white corporate men who can't fathom that the barista isn't flirting with them) have complained about me saying I seem like im in a bad mood... like NO!! This is just what im like!!! I cant help it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I literally can't smile. Like I sound all friendly and what not but I forget to smile when using my customer service voice
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: literally same plus I work in williamsburg brooklyn (transplant central) so I get a lot of dumbass entitled customers, and have no choice but to give them this so called "gen z stare." One of my coworkers was told by corporate that she "doesn't smile enough"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, I really get the forgetting to use facial expressions, like bruh this blank face was trained into me as a child, leave me aloneeee
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Blue collar worker my coworker made a joke and I didn't respond in the way she wanted and I just shrugged my shoulders like "it's cool. I have autism. It is what it is"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah I can't look at people man they will just have to get over it lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have that issue too sometime, or my head will hurt so it looks like I'm pouty/glaring. Or my face twitches sometimes so people find that weird :[
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I believe you, but a lot of people say they have autism.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@Dizzydawne yeah, i think part of it is misdiagnonsis and autism screening being more acceptable. I see mostly younger people faking autism to be seen as quirky and unique (same thing with them claiming DID) but i think part of that 'trend' is over for them, or at least slowing down.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I understand completely. I was raised the same way. And it seems like you get shit for it either way no matter what you do.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Carlos_Quintero_  Exactly. This is why all these complaints are gonna fall on deaf ears. You suck at listening, then enjoy the silence. Simple.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was raised like that and I have ADHD so it was extra hard for me to keep my mouth shut. By middle school, I pretty much stopped talking altogether and became really introverted because I was tired of being punished for speaking. I had a teacher in elementary school put my desk in a big wooden box so I couldn't see my classmates in order to stop me from talking, so I started talking to myself out loud to fill the silence, and I still do this at 22. Pretty sure that teacher fucked me up for life lol. COVID hit but I went to college anyways, had some online classes but we pretty quickly transitioned back to in person with masks and I finally started coming out of my shell, mostly through the way I dressed, and it got me a lot of nice comments which really gave me a confidence boost. I've gotten to where I don't care enough to mask and I started talking a lot more, but now I'm seeing those same repercussions that come with opening my mouth. I'll think I'm making a friend, but I'm really just making people uncomfortable because no one really wants to talk. I feel like just keeping my mouth shut is easier.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @pixlbunni  i always joke that my main goal is to make ppl as uncomfortable as possible (i can never stop speaking long enough to notice that someone wants me to stop speaking😔)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was raised the same way, and also to never invite myself to anything
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same here but I do actually believe in following the golden rule. So when I was working customer service I was genuinely kind and friendly to all the customers or at least most of them, when and I was serving a customer I would always smile and compliment them and wish them a nice day at the end. But that didn't stop them from berating me and S.H ING me on an almost daily basis and on a few occasions even physically assaulting me.  I still remember how it was. I wouldn't go back to that unless I was absolutely desperate so I can't blame anyone working in customer service for not wanting to smile and tell everyone how special they are because for all I know on their first day they probably were all smiles and compliments but they have been worn down by the worst of humanity over time to the point where they probably expect the worst from every customer or they're probably neurodiverse or mentally unwell and are probably pushing themselves to the absolute limits just to live. Let alone work and because I can't see into people's souls. I wouldn't want to judge them for something they can't control and I think everyone else should have that mentality personally.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THISSS the worst faith interpretation is so real!!! when i say okay im not being agressive im saying i understand
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That type of upbringing, sadly, leads people to not have good social or communication skills.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jenniferburchill3658  welcome to every religious household ever
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: oh fuck this hit me where i live.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I often would get filled with thoughts that maybe it would genuinely be better if I just closed my mouth and shut up, but then I would get scolded for not answering. Genuinely a no win situation. I'm now pretty reserved and have, very often, a very expressionless face which looks grumpy as hell. Super felt the tone thing. Often I'm matching the energy unintentionally! But older people haaaaate that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @GeodeCrowley22  Yup I’m in the same boat and I completely agree 😢 We’ll escape someday though 😤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT  I was raised with my grandmother, and she would say these things to me all the time and I realized that there was no correct way to talk to her, so I just stopped talking.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There's also the whole "stranger danger" thing we were taught in elementary school and sometimes by our parents. There had to be a better way to teach us street smarts than by teaching us that everyone was dangerous and wanted to kidnap us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same, usually when 'I stare off into the distance' I'm trying to think of a way to respond that isn't rude. I avoid confrontation in general because of it, to the point that I'm causing more problems than I'm solving.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Or when I tried defending myself, I would be told I was making up excuses 😒.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As the youngest person in my office, the eldest people never want to take their own advice of shutting the hell up but are perfectly fine with telling other people to keep quiet
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: was also raised this way, was told "kids are seen not heard generation was gen x, shut up!!!" when i brought it up, lol. what about gen z who are in the older brackets (pushing 25 and being lumped in a generation w/ 15 y/os is another issue i could scream about for decades) and were raised by genuine baby boomers.... do people think those childrearing habits just go away bcs the boomer parents are on kid #3, 4, etc? we still get slapped with "kids are seen, not heard" when we don't have millennial parents, but people think it doesn't apply to us, and act bewildered when we're seen and not heard ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh god same. I just want to be nice to people but they're so mean. Also I've been told so often that being nice is basically being naive
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I wasn't even raised like this, but i naturally gravitated towards it.  I was raised to value honesty, never harm someone else, to treat people like i'd want to be treated, etc. All the good things a person should strive for.  Then i would see my role models lie for a variety of reasons or tell me i should not be afraid to fight if i ever got into a fight. So at the end i kinda felt like none of my values worked in the real world (because they don't, sometimes you just have to hurt someone and lie to survive, merely due to the world we live in). And i kinda stopped wanting to interact with people in general.   Because it is either abandoning those principles or just distancing myself from those that make them impossible to enable. And i value my principles as my own identity.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh my god yes. I especially had this beat into me going to a catholic school, metaphorically speaking lol. You go all of your formative years being told to be quiet, listen to people, speak only when spoken to. Of course this becomes an issue going into the adult world at work. It’s so hard to break out of that. People at work think I’m rude or stupid because I keep to myself most of the time and do my job.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @SunnieBunnie9752 tbh i keep to myself because i do not want to share my personal life with people at work. I like to keep a separation between work and my actual life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yup. everytime ive had a conversation with an adult cuz i did something wrong and they want to know "why" i did it, it always ends the same. never heard, never understood, always accused of making excuses, i should know better, im lazy and its my fault, i have to try harder! i cant expect older neurotypical ppl to treat me like an equal, so i just try to ring them up and get them out, but then they get offended when you arent all nice and go above and beyond for them, you just cant please the lead poisoned folk!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i get this treatment even from muly boyfriend. he doesn't want me to talk too much cuz I'm complaining too much, but if i don't talk he thinks i hate him.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @juliadesouza6674 hey friend I hope you find the strength to consider walking away. Boyfriend is a totally optional status and he is not carrying it with honor or respect based on what you describe. You deserve real reciprocity and good faith from the person you choose to have as a partner.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Omg yes!! At uni my lecturer once offhandedly asked us why we all seem afraid to speak up in group discussions, or why we dont ask questions during lectures, or why we dont seem to move our hands or body much to emphasise what we are talking about.  I looked him dead in the eye and told him its because weve been berated or punished for doing those things our entire lives. He was in disbelief but everyone else around me said yea exactly. When you get a negative response every time you take interest in something eventually you just stop trying to join in.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was raised in a cult plus this mindset and am gen Z. Ive started pulling myself out of that pit and have found community with my lgbt+ elders. If you never try to stop being that silenced child, nothing will change. We didn't deserve that treatment but it's our life, no one else can change it for us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i say this with respect: it sounds like you fall on the autism spectrum but are well-functioning enough that it wasn't "caught" in childhood. obv i'm not diagnosing you but you might want to read into it, might help you figure out smth even if you don't end up relating overall to the textbook high-functioning autistic behaviors/experience/whatever.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @GodheadNee  lol im very aware that its likely, but with the state of the world atm it wouldnt benefit me to seek an actual diagnosis because it could make jobs and things a lot harder, especially in the US with trump
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THIS OH MY GOD my mother would yell at me until i cried over making sure i had “proper eye contact” so i literally just forget to use facial expressions sometimes when listening to others. like no im not judging you or plotting your demise
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I mean from the social classes I went too you're supposed to look at least semi present when you make eye contact when talking. Which makes sense, people want to feel engaged in a conversation rather than a feeling of being ignored or tuned out. On the other hand I don't really know what my face does half the time talking to people so I haven't really managed to find a solution yet either. I just know the theory.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z is the goofiest, weakest generation.  Millenials are raising Gen Alpha and theyre going to dominate all the weak and indifferent Gen Z.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z is so entitled, we think we deserve to be able to afford a home on less than 3 full time jobs and be able to get said jobs on less than 3000 job applications, I agree, we are very entitled to think we should be treated as people instead of chattel for billionaires.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I refuse to participate in pitting people against each other for their age when billionaires so much as exist. Yeah the minimum wage worker stares at you. Their future is being actively pillaged.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Younger generations in general get the short end of the stick as they come into the world. I'm an older millenial and I remember coming into my first job post-uni and seeing the articles that we were lazy, entitled, wanting participation trophies, and being blamed for the slow down of diamond and mayo sales. Now that same thing is being applied to Gen Z.  I've worked with a lot of amazing, bright Gen Z, and a lot socially inept Millenials, Gen-X, and Boomers as well. Generational generalizations can be fun to look at and meme about, but it's harmful to view the world and categorize people right off the bat based on just that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't really have an issue with generic greetings, but there are two things that can get me to give them that stare. 1. "Oh why aren't you smiling?" 2. Some corny joke like "I guess its free" I genuinely cannot fake a smile. If I am smiling, it's real. If I'm not, it doesn't mean I'm unhappy. It just means I'm neutral usually.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen-Z is socially awkward for sure, but older generations are just flat out rude and they are NOT used to people setting boundaries or not forcing themselves to be nice. They think that they’re entitled to respect from younger people no matter how they treat you. So it’s a bit of both and I say this as someone from Gen-Z.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1:23 I BEEN waiting for someone to bring the lead paint stare into this. I js KNOW that the ‘gen z stare’ is js their old head way of projecting that shit onto the poor gen z server or cashier they said smth dumb to. Even when you ask them why they got the stare they always start with, “so I was being extremely rude for no reason, cause my life is so hard, and that underpaid 17 y/o stared at me funny”. Like bro look inwards
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm Gen X.  I remember all the articles written about "the slacker generation", that we were lazy, inept, unwilling to work, blah blah blah.   Then we did it to Millennials, and now we're doing it to Gen Z.   Because humans never learn.  Personally, I don't blame Gen Z for the "stare" at all, considering the world they were born into and the way things are now.   But please do be patient with me as I try to figure out technology.  😊
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “Gen z stare is so rude” my brotha you just asked me how many gallons are in a five gallon pail. I don’t do the Gen z stare often, but some people need to be humbled
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The “Gen Z stare” is just gen Z being more deadpan than previous generations.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 8:52 I feel like this is the biggest disconnect in generations in work they say it’s because “we feel more comfortable talking online” no, I’m just not your friend and don’t want to talk to you. Im at work not a house party.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i know it's not EVERY man, but the amount of (often old) men who hit on me on the daily has caused me to completely block out anything they say to me beyond basic pleasantries. i had someone say to me that i was, quote, "cuter than a pup's speckled ass" and then get huffy when i just looked at him. like...??? why would you say that?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 22:00 I've noticed nearly every generation's "generational quirks" have that level of intense stigma when they're considered the "youth" of the day.  My partner is Gen X and I'm a Millennial. He's mentioned to me before that his entire generation was treated like none of them were ever going to achieve anything of worth while growing up.  Meanwhile I'd felt growing up like every single thing the older generations hated about society just got blamed on Millennials. Gen Z is definitely not to blame for making generational quirks a big thing. It makes me think of how there are publications complaining about how "people don't want to work anymore" dating back as far as history can find.  Younger generations just make convenient scapegoats for older generations. Especially since they're still figuring their shit out and getting their feet on the ground.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 5:54 Girl, that's a look of fear. I can't 😂 I'm dying here. That's not at all menacing nor is it giving condescending. The face she gave is genuinely an expression of fear.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as an older gen z, i think there is a drastic difference between gen z who went through their puberty during the pandemic n before pandemic since it shows how socially different we r
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Something that’s like the most inviting about older generations trashing on gen z for just like staring at people I guess is the fact that like in a lot of cases it’s not even that serious. They are still doing their job. They just take a second to look at you before they say something.  I got the “gen z stare” from a worker (we’re both gen z) after I asked her if the theater had a lost and found. She looked at me for a solid minute before asking what I lost. I wouldn’t have thought about it at all until I saw fifty videos about the gen z stare or whatever. Some people just need a second to think guys 💔
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 18:44 funny thing is, if anyone talks to me like this, they’re getting the stare.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 18:46 i stopped saying hello when called by unknown numbers purely bc i don't want scammers to record my voice. I'm very polite once I know I'm talking to a human and not a bot
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Late boomer, I have social anxiety and have always strongly believed in small talk. "Hi" and "Have a nice day" work wonders. It may be because I grew up in NYC where 10 second conversations with passersby on the sidewalk have always been a thing. To my knowledge I have not experienced the Gen Z stare.  Also, the Gen Z folk in my life are all very charming and sweet, but I do sense a deep sadness. In general when I meet Gen Z for the first time there is a certain reticence, but they perk up once they feel comfortable. I feel really sad for Gen Z folk, the pandemic was hard and things haven't gotten much better since then.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the example at 5:34 is crazy bc I (gen z) am a server, but I get those stares/reactions the most from gen x and older.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm gen Z and I used to work in a fast food restaurant (I won't say which one) and my workplace was INCREDIBLY toxic, yet I gave the "Gen Z stare" one time to a man that was berating me since I was being "too slow" because I was reading the menu to someone who had their glasses broken and couldn't read. I quit that day.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @sophie3869  nah you can see it seems pretty sarcastic once he says "on less than 3 full time jobs"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I know right. The audacity of me to want a job and a place to live I’m just so entitled
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh give me a break, we have all been busting our asses for billionaires for decades. Yeah inflation handed you a shitty cost of living. But it's up to you Gen Z's and us millennials to change things.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @zephryus How the fuck do we change things when it isn't even in our control. When we're already too busy trying to fucking survive and afford to live comfortably. Did you not just say in the same sentence that it's in the billionaires power? 'We all have been busting our asses for billionaires for decades', any grown adult who isn't arrogant will tell you how much the cost of living has increased over the years. Literally just search for any graphic data showing the rent as a percentage of income over time. And that's only ONE factor. You speak as if it always been this hard to afford daily shit.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@zephryusok, why didn't you do something about it as a millennial? You've had decades, no? We're on the same side, you couldn't do it for the same reasons we can't.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you, the conversation always addresses symptoms of a larger issue would these workers care as much to be dealing with these people if they were being adequately paid?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The diamond thing has always been weird to me: why are they made at you for disrupting a false monopoly that gets 90% of its product from child exploitation? How is that even possible to frame as a bad thing?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Smaestr Because it threatens to upend the status quo and forces people to actually consider the world they thought they knew more critically. Also because those industries most likely financially influence media companies to spread messages that benefit their interests (after all, they have the money to do it).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SmaestrMad* Also, it’s not like they are slowing the diamond sales and Mayo sales out of some altruistic intention, it’s just they are too broke RN to afford them…literally the most selfish generation filled with hubris
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The problem is people take media like memes and comedy and start to apply them in socialization. Aka some people are not mature or have enough critical thinking to be taking in the content they have been exposed to in the digital age. For gen z it’s the former and for boomers it’s the latter.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i remember every other head line being "are millennials killing the __ industry?"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @MortuaryGirl  ugh the headlines
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Late millennial here. I was once blamed for the 2008 market crash despite just being a junior in high school.  Make it make sense. I'll wait
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @afmghost1759  Anyone to take the blame off the wealthy people in charge of the housing. Thats all it is, shifting blame away from themselves
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So true. I'm an older gen z, and I remember about a decade ago when generational stereotypes were that gen y/millennials were the socially awkward ones while gen z were outspoken, didn't care how they came across while consuming brainrot. Now those stereotypes have shifted to gen z and gen alpha respectively. Maybe it's really an age stereotype thing (young adults versus teens and children) than generational
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Every generation needs their little moral panic about the next
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @zagiproductions1630  you’re right
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: boomers and gen x mad that we wont buy their overly expensive clear rocks
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: its also insane to me that older gens are mad at a fake problem of younger gens wanting participation trophies when THOSE older gens demanded their kids get something so they feel better. like yall are the ones who made participation trophies a thing and youre mad about it?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @kaitlynmorgan4613  ooof that’s good
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Love this, just treat eachother like humans and have some tolerance for being treated poorly. We've all had bad days, a little kindness goes so far for making us all feel less alone.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hahaha the killing small talk article remind of those stupid “are millennials killing the [blank] industry?”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Blamed for decline in mayo sales is wild 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THIS!!!! not everyone and every situation is so black and white and generalizing groups only causes harm!!!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: See. It is not so fun to be "judge" according to your internet generation.  It's just ridiculous, in my opinion. I think it more comes down to the phenomena of "self fulfilling prophecy". Others see what they wanna see and nitpick on it, because the concept of "alphas" and "gen z" is just made up, either way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THIS! ...oh how easy do we forget...like I cannot believe the nerve of fellow millennials going after gen z....like dude...no
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @effiecasta same. It’s so weird. We were JUST here with the avocado toast
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah Gen Z, and to a lesser extent Millennials, are really the first generations to emphatically put their foot down about not putting up with blatant disrespect and contempt just because someone happens to be older than you AND share their experiences and feelings en masse. The generations that came of age hearing "children are meant to be seen not heard" and "respect your elders" and all that aren't used to that "rebellion" and are responding in kind.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i honestly think there's this culture of disrespecting children we've had as a society for a long time and it feels like both the actual reaction AND the ridicule of the younger generations in general both are deeply influenced by it. Of course I'm saying this as a younger person who has only had my generations' pov firsthand, so i can't definitively say, but from everything i hear from others i have found very little evidence to the contrary.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @anthtotallynotmr.uttersont5481 we have to convince the middle gens that young people are stupid or else they might group together to take out the dominant power structure
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Society do be lovin' its scapegoats...I've also noticed society likes to keep kicking the goalpost as to what age adulthood is. Almost like a bunch of dinosaurs want to hold onto power they don't deserve by claiming everyone else is 'immature'.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly. The criticism of younger generations is really so boring and reflects on the critic for not understanding that people are naturally gonna be at different stages in life. Like duh.  And social skills go both ways. If you can't make someone comfortable enough to talk to you easily then you are also lacking in social skills. Simply expecting a person to respond in a predetermined  way and then crashing out when they don't doesn't get anyone anywhere. That's just a tantrum.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We never made it about technology haha...  it's about gen x having the mindset of im right even when im wrong.....
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: BLESS YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONCE GENUINELY ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Your an awesome person 👍 thank you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: AWW WAIT THIS IS SO CUTE! And very well said! (Gen-z here 😼)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I understand what youre saying, but that argument absolutely crumbles under the power of statistics. Gen z really is AWFUL at social interaction. This is not older gen crapping on the younger gen. Im 29, and man... almost every single gen z person ive met has zero idea how to have a conversation.   So tired of this stupid excuse, "theyve always blah blah blah" yeah no, this is an epidemic of horrendous social skills.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @johnfisher8401 two things can be true. A lot of Gen Z lived their formative years on lockdown, and that inevitably stunts their social skills. However, it's also absolutely true that the younger generation entering the workforce always gets called lazy, inept, etc. However, to argue that all of Gen Z is unable to socialize is just ridiculous lmao. I'm part of that generation, work in customer service and socialize w friends and strangers every day. You can't just generalize based on "statistics", and then only present your own personal experience.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @johnfisher8401  Yeah, about that... Maybe you're the problem.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @johnfisher8401  With all due respect, have you traveled the world and seen every gen Z people? If not, then you shouldn't be talking about millions of people like that, seriously.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: YES I've seen people get screwed over so hard or straight up being harassed and abused but STILL DEFEND  THEIR COWORKER the boss ain't your friend neither are the other employees a job is a JOB
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: thing is, ill make some small talk when at work if its not busy. dont expect me to spend time talkin to u when theres a line of ppl behind u n im the only cashier and ppl refuse to use the self check outs if they have card
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've literally been called a mouse at work because I don't say anything! Y'all aren't my friends!! I already need to waste my voice on clients😂😂😂😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: YES. Also, I just hate small talk in general. It's awkward, pointless and just... Why do you talk to me when you don't REALLY wanna TALK??? I just prefer long meaningful conversations.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @LuenudCreaciones It's gonna be much harder getting those long conversations without gauging how the other person is feeling
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@LuenudCreaciones ??? How do you think would these long deep conversations happen if you don't start with smalltalk?  "Why do you want to talk to me if you don't really wanna talk to me?", they are literally putting down the groundwork for that. Do you just approach people with "Hi, do you think deep down you're a good person", without even knowing where they come from? How did you get to know your current friends? How did the connections you have started?  If you mark yourself as "Not interested in making connections" then that's your thing, but that has nothing to do with smalltalk being "pointless". If I ask you what your favorite color is, I want to get to know you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it's not like we can't become friends either. just actually have something interesting to say and show interest in my interests and we can be work besties. i just don't care what kind of cake you ate last weekend, sorry.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: but if your in a customer facing role that is part of your job description is usually being friendly to bad if its forced its part of the role you agreed to
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Kids don't know how to communicate anymore. And they always say some BS like to throw around therapy speak as a way to justify their rude behavior and social ineptness.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Elizahmations  sounds more like you’re just pissy about getting rejected. And if a lot of kids don’t know how to communicate then complain to their parents, a child doesn’t raise themselves.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: small talk is how u make friends w coworkers tho. like community.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Kaynighthood  I don’t really want to make friends with my coworkers, though. I’m reasonable towards them, of course. If they talk to me, I’ll give a short response and move on, since I don’t want to talk. These aren’t people I have any connection to, though. These are people who I’m legally obligated to be around, and would make it awkward if we were on bad terms. So, I don’t want to be friends with my coworkers. Acquaintances at best.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Kaynighthood I have several friends of 20+ years I don’t care to be anymore than acquaintances with any of the people at work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Kaynighthood  i dont want to be friends with coworkers, most of these people have lived vastly different lives than me, i dont want people i routinely disagree with because of our differing lived experiences as "friends"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: tf?? where would the idea to ever say that sentence to a human being even come from 😭🙏
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: GENUINELY and they act like /you're/ the rude one for staring or just not responding positively.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@LillethTheRabbit  they're way too used to getting at least an awkward laugh. if you give them nothing they're forced to wallow in their feelings
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I had some dude in a truck try and get my attention, I did a side eye to show I noticed him then kept walking so he whistled and kept saying hey until I went inside. I'm not a dog to whistle at. Now I've been paranoid and have been finding it difficult to go outside because anytime I don't have a man (my husband or one of our guy friends) I get whistled at or hit on. My friend and I went to a movie last Saturday and we literally had a dude on the opposite train bark at us. These are older men, 40+. I've not had a Gen Z man do that but maybe a couple times. I'm only 21 and afraid to roam the streets around where I live without having a man with me. That shouldn't be a thing for anyone. People get so upset that I use my resting b*tch face but I don't like interacting with strange men or women and sometimes they leave me alone if I look scary and have ear buds in.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Was that supposed to be a compliment or an insult because who the hell says that?!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@neovagras980  i think he was trying to hit on me, which was weird because i showed absolutely zero signs of being interested in him and also he was 65 and i'm 20 🤨
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I used to work at a subway when I was in high school (only 27 now lol), and had an older man WITH HIS WIFE invite my seventeen year old self on vacation, while I made their food. He also called me really pretty and complimented my name. I'm also a guy, bisexual, but still...it was weird af. x-x
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: there are so many examples of this happening on the click's channel where someone will go out of their way to make the most insanely deluded and perverted statement to somebody and act shocked that their "shakespearean" attempt wasn't reciprocated with appreciation and head or whatever lmfao, like what the hell do you mean you're shocked that people don't like it when you make the most egregious comment about someone's body?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This one guy i know keeps like Trying to grasp my hand 😭😭  One time i just said "nooo please dont dooo thaaattt 😅😅😅" and he just like Didnt stop bruh 😭😭  Idk i know he probably means well but i feel SO uncomfortable around him 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@Goobergobbs  um...if you asked him to stop and he didn't, he definitely does not mean well. if he meant well, he would listen to you and care what you thought.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was waiting outside one time and multiple dude approached me, some just cat called and one (younger) just shakes my hand when I said I’m not interested. But this older drunk guy started by complimenting me, I said thank you and just stopped looking at him, then he started talking abt other stuff, like how because of my black lipstick I looked like I just sucked him ( he had dark skin). I just smiled and ignored him and he really got mad. That’s just only one situation tho
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: rightt also i've NEVER seen a gen z person do that in response to that question. in response to small talk? yeah, i'm sure ppl have just stared instead of saying something back. but we know how to order at a restaurant/café 😭😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And it’s giving “top ten things that never happened”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @meyssaachouarfia  yea like she cannot be 100% fr 💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i found the restaurant example so interesting as gen z i’ve noticed older people do the same thing but are vocal  ex humming while looking through the menu, talking with others at the table about their possible order, “oh i’m not ready yet someone else can go” and half the table doesn’t have an order read, etc instead of looking at a waiter and saying “give us a minute”! i’ve had to speak for tables w friends my age AS WELL as older people
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​ @dannydevitosthiccbussy7764  Right, but I think that is what even I as a young millennial finds so eerie about the gen z stare. Vocalising, saying "Hmm...", talking with the others around the table about what they are ordering, etc. Even if it is not an answer to the question, it shows a reaction to the question and that the attempt at communication was succesfully received and is being processed. More importantly, it shows that the person is alive and not a reanimated cadaver. The blank, silent, stare with no reaction or response, is not only incredibly rude, it also elicits grave concern, both for the young person's health, but also for the frightening prospect that lobotomies might have made a comeback.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i wonder y they gave her that look bc theres no way ✋️😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got my period kinda before/during the pandemic and yeah i never go out, i dont do anything…i stay inside and i js cant get myself to go out idk
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i def think the pandemic kind of shaped how they interact for sure because that was something unprecedented
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes! This is so true. Older Gen-Z and younger Gen-Z are two different sides of this topic💯
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: YUP, I was 19-20 when the pandemic started, so already pretty much set in my ways. Can't imagine being like 13 back then.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im an older gen z and honestly after covid the way I interact with people felt more awkward but ngl I dont want to be talking to nobody sometimes
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My partner is the oldest gen z (1997, 28 yrs) and she refuses to actually accept that I, (2003, 22 yrs) am also considered ‘older gen z’ and this comment opened my eyes as to why I am. I started puberty at around 8 (not kidding) and although the pandemic involved some of my most important developmental years becoming an adult, I definitely finished all of my ‘teen growth’ phase before then. It’s interesting to hear it put this way, it makes sense for sure.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Hebinushi don't think you should be with someone who sees you as a child ngl
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Hebinushi  I'm 2000 genz and I think younger genz starts at around '07. Mid genz is '03-'06
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly I keep seeing this opinion but I’m older gen z and lowkey act like younger gen z. I did online school all through out hs though so I think it really affected me. I’m very asocial now and don’t like when strangers talk to me. I say as little as possible and I don’t even stare but try not to even look at people and move quickly in public. I don’t want to get caught in small talk. It feels like a draining performance. I look at communication as an exchange of information. So a lot of small talk seems pointless. I also look at community as common interests that bring people together and helping others when needed, not chatting with strangers in line or service workers. Everyone is just different too but I keep seeing people demonize others for being “antisocial” and “lacking community” when some of us just connect and go about community differently. I think there’s hope for young gen z. There will just be a shift in how people interact with each other and that’s okay in my opinion.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Kind of how I feel about elder millennials who didn’t get internet until our early to mid teens vs. younger millennials who don’t remember the sound of AOL dial-up processing 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah because I’m an older genz while my little brother is a younger genz. I don’t think I’m socially awkward. Only time I’m really awkward is when it’s an objectively awkward situation. Like a man flirting with me. But my little brother is very awkward. I socialized at work to the point I’m known by people at work I’ve never met. I’m usually the one comfortable asking questions about the menu. When I’m in a crowd of new people I usually will start the conversation to make new friends. But I feel people also need to just learn to be accepting instead of judgmental. Why are we making people being social awkward a bad thing? My friend she’s a fairly younger genz and she’s more socially awkward. Instead of making fun of her. I’m just understanding and ask her if she wants me to ask questions. Why not be a good example and encourage them to see it’s not that bad…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm only 26 I do have social anxiety but the pandemic definitely had an affect even just slight. Was such a strange time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was quarantined for 6 weeks of school and failed my seniors and college level courses because of it. I also had my entire self worth built off my school capabilities and I collapse so hard
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Can confirm— I was in the graduating class of 2019, and the change I’ve observed has been INSANE between pre and post Covid GenZ. My coworker and I each are on one side of the train tracks of this phenomenon and sometimes we catch each other on these specific differences. Although I doubt we’ll see more solid examples until we as a generation settle into our late 20s/early 30s
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @MunsterFrizbee  no you can not. you are one individual. statistically, you are already biased.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: man, the more we highlight these differences, the bigger the perceived gap grows, all im saying. we all are different.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sure, but you’re also just comparing teens and adult fetuses with people well in their 20s lol… Obviously adults are better at navigating the world, and this is true across generations.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Facts 1997-2004 are totally different to those born after 2005
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just replied to someone about how the pandemic happening just as I was beginning puberty was not helping lmao. It was genuinely awful
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: my sister and I are on the complete opposite ends of gen z, I (2006) and my sister (1997) were both more social before the pandemic, and then we weren't. while I'm less social than she is, we both struggle a lot with mental health, which caused me to need to finish senior year online, I talk to more people online while she talks to more people irl.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Tbh nah, I'm considered younger Gen Z and I was concerningly introverted and asocial long before the pandemic hit lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @explosivelemonkaboom I mean that’s definitely a problem with the entire generation due to the internet- but the pandemic worsened it significantly for most people
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "I think people who are 17 are different than people who are 25" why are people so quick to blame the pandemic when, at least in my experience, my fellow gen z have been socially avoidant and anxious since before the pandemic, it's almost like making our main form of connection going through the Internet wasn't good for us
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was 13 during the pandemic and going through my cycle ,just learning about periods and stuff like that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was 12 when the pandemic started and i suffer immensely socially, but i also don't believe for a second that anyone has been in complete silence staring at a waitress when they sit down. But yeah it took 2 years off my life and i still feel 2 years younger than i am.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeahh, i was born in 2001 and the cutoff gotta be 2003. anybody born after (THAT IVE MET PERSONALLY) act COMPLETELY different. way more in tune with their online life, super active on social media, but dont reflect any of that IRL. usually awkward in conversations and what not. its not a bad thing, social anxiety and stuff like that are normal. but just something ive noticed where im at in NC lmao. the pandemic definitely effected social interactions for a lot of younger people including their worth ethic since at the time all their schoolwork was online and inevitably resulted in laziness and the use of AI and the internet to answer everything for them (because online IS SO DIFFERENT THAN IN-PERSON LEARNING! IT DOES NOTTT WORK FOR EVERYBODY), so whenever theyre working, following a simple part time or full time schedule is drastically harder for them because theyre not used to being held accountable since it was always "optional" growing up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: True, i know before the pandemic i was much more comfortable talking haha, i still say excuse me, sorry, hello, hi, nice to meet you, but ngl i do be staring and blanking off, i feel younger and even older genzs have a LOT of trauma and especially it seems a surge in Neglectful parents. Millennials do not want to teach their kids, its like school. Some parents dont teach their children basic morals because "they learn at school" a teachers job is essentially to teach them more evolved versions of what their parents should have been giving guidance for ALL THEIR CHILDHOOD, parenthood really does not end, you cannot just NOT teach your kids once theyre like 15. I was raised very sheltered and isolated(mostly bc of being poor and homeschooled) so i was already socially awkward. So when covid hit it was a devastating situation and it went from a small anxiety or nervous attack to panic attacks from going in stores or at my (part time) job. Im better now but honestly i zone out and dont respond because i am internally having a panic attack and having people putting the pressure of small talk and questions on me when im (adhd autism) and dont even know them its like...ehhh...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yesss! I had my first year of high school in 2020 (year 7, no intermediate school where I live) which is personally one of the most important years when starting high school hahah
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is so true. Honestly I already felt like a zillenial having grown up with a lot of older kids around me and in an area that got trends a few years later. Found it crazy even taking a year off of school before college because of COVID and not wanting to waste my money on a year online. Even the difference between my grade that got hit with COVID during senioritis and the ones in the year after and after that. For this reason and also noticing how different the brain rot is for graduates of hs pre and post 2020 I’ve started just calling everyone a zillenial (1995-2002) and gen z (2003-2010) then of course gen alpha is after that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes, I was starting highschool (UK) when the pandemic started and the transition between schools and puberty and generally all the change really messed me up and as a 16 year old now I never leave the house and just prefer to stay inside alone
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was 10 when the pandemic started, can't socialize very well now 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you went through puberty after the pandemic youre not gen z lmfao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It was 2 years. That argument doesn't add up, but everyone uses it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Dobermanmomma  you need to understand how significant a time period 2 years is for someone in a stage of rapid development. a 14 year old is notably different from when they were 12 years old.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Dobermanmomma it literally does because Gen z in the workforce are stunted. 2 years of social distancing is a LITERAL SENTENCE FOR SOCIAL INEPTITUDE
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i also think a big thing in customer service is that you kinda get in a rhythm of basically the same conversation over and over again. so, when someone asks a question you haven't heard in a while if at all it can take a minute to think of how to respond.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @dudebbro yes! So real! Especially because you’re usually taught exactly what to say and not to say anything else.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also being mentally ill can really slow down thinking/ processing speed. I have gotten so slow at answering “boring” questions because I just can’t focus my mind when it’s always in panic mode
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @mint7442 Yeah, people are a lot less understanding of those things now. I’m on the autistic spectrum, and I have an audio processing disorder, so it takes me a minute to even fully understand what someone said to me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THAT TOO covid fried a lot of people's brains, 1 in 20 people have fetal alchohol syndrome, a TON of us are diagnosed with adhd, depression, and other things - brain functions might just be /slow./
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly I have audhd as well and sometimes it feels like my brain short-circuits mid convo and I take a moment to process everything. Sometimes I straight up forget what was said  At this point it sounds like if someone accuses me of staring all I can reply with is explaining that I have autism or else that accusation will just run rampant after me.  People need to learn that no, not everyone's brains, are carbon copies of the average human.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes!!! You asked a question. Gen z doesn't like being asked questions...they feel much safer when they can control the conversation and the question. "What did you loose?"  She took control.....next time youre out with your gen z friends. Pay attention to who is asking questions instead of making statements....
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SwarthyJackson-h4k  or theyre just thinking about how to answer the question? not everything is an attack on you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SwarthyJackson-h4k  I feel like most people feel more comfortable when they're in control over a situation, but this scenario specifically doesn't seem to revolve around control at all. I personally would've asked what they lost as well just in case I had potentially seen the lost item somewhere. It's always interesting to me seeing how different people interpret these interactions because I never would've thought of it that way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SwarthyJackson-h4k  this is part of the reason that gen z struggle to want to make small talk or to initate any conversation, because it's turned around as back talk or manipulation. when there's no real reason to assume that they were trying to "take control". Or if you wanted to understand why they might feel unsafe being asked questions it might be because our answers end up getting twisted to mean something else and our words are not taken seriously or statements are read as too direct and also an attack. asking questions isn't assuming control, it's literally just a part of normal communication.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This whole comment section literally proves why Gen Z is awful in every way, haha.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SikeItsIke I genuinely don’t see how this shows there’s nothing good about this generation 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly hate how she mocked phone anxiety I have it and it's not fun especially for important calls.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What drives me insane is if you call them out, they just lean on "no you lack comprehension, the gen Z stare ISN'T when people say something dumb!" Meanwhile every single example given was when they said or did something stupid.  "I went out of my way to hunt down and asked a girl to give a coworker her phone number for work!" why didn't you just give it yourself instead of wasting all that time? Stupid.  "I called you on the phone and you picked up and you waited for ME to say hello!" Why did you make a phone call and then not speak? The one who initiates the conversation (or phone call) is the one meant to speak first. Stupid.  I could go on. The problem is that these people think "no! no! MY example isn't of ME being stupid!"  only example that's even close to the older person NOT being dumb is the one where she approaches a table and asks if she can start them with anything and they just stare, but frankly, I don't believe it happened like that. Even if it did, it's absolutely the youngest of gen Z that did this, or it's someone autistic or something, because I have NEVER seen a gen Z, in real life or online, who can't at least struggle out a "no we don't need help right now."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @jadecoolness101  this response is everything, I'm not on tiktok as a younger Gen Z but she would be blocked immediately the way she was mocking very real and difficult conditions people struggle with Glad to see someone as passionately pissed off as me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i do this and it wasn't even my idea, my MOM told me to do that, like forget generation anything, the phone scammers these days are Out Of Control.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same here! I just play whatever is going on in the background for when that happens. If it's a person, then I start talking. It sucks that these bots make it worse, too 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If someone from my contacts calls me I say hello but if they’re not then I don’t
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah she sounded downright insufferable
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Real. I usually say hello in a weird voice like I'm a little alien. 9/10 it's a scam call so.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is literally it, I usually cough and that’s enough to make the scam robot start talking so I can hang up, like it’s not that big of a deal
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly, if people know me, they will text me. If I am answering the phone, it's probably something I initiated in the first place, like a doctor calling me back. Unless my caller ID says you're my fiance or my mom, I'm probably not gonna answer. Leave me a voicemail and I'll think about calling back lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @TheDrowWarlock same i don't answer calls unless it's someone i know, and i live in a dangerous country so that just makes me extra anxious
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People used to have a whole long spiel when they answered the phone.  I remember when people would answer every call by reciting their phone number or even their address!! And I've worked with people who had weird catchphrases when answering the phone.  A boss who would answer serious work calls on the work line in the name of other businesses.  People who would answer in French or German or Spanish.  "Aloha" or even "Ahoy".  So I guess silence is jarring to those folks.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same! I was taught to not say anything first, especially not “yes?” when called by an unknown number
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I needed this. Thank you. We really are trying our best out here.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 2020 was a complete shift and things have continuously gotten worse (I’m 21)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was out of line and under caffenated. I'm sorry, I'm just extremely tired
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠@Smaestrat least you owned up to your mistake and apologized. Most people wouldn’t, so personally I think it’s all good now
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I appreciate this a lot.  And you are right, there is a deep sadness in this generation.  For me personally it feels like everything I was promised and the look at a better world was taken from us. Pulled away in an instant. We can’t be ourselves, we’re so broke we have to stay with our toxic families. All I ever wanted was to go to college, get a career, fall in love, and live a happy normal life. But it feels like I can’t even do that anymore. I feel stuck and the politics are making it so so much worse.  I just wish more people were like you and came around to understand so we can move forward again.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This thread just proves how sweet you guys are :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the deep sadness is real - a genz
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you for understanding. I try to talk about what happens to someone's facial expressions when someone has depression, or they are traumatized. Which, in this case of the pandemic and our economy right this minute, in makes sense for both to be well written within my generation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THIS! For real, this generation has grown up looking up towards their adulthood with hope, only for it to be smashed to piece by the pandemic and the continual decline in the state of the world. Gen Z has had a VERY rough beginning to life
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Things have arguably gotten way worse since the pandemic
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a member of gen z -- we also just have a lot of mistrust towards older folk -- i don't like making generalizations as a rule but I have noticed both in myself and in others that there's a certain reluctance to interact with the same people that voted overwhelmingly for trump, who demonize identities, sexualities, and damn pronouns. I think once we get to actually talk to older folk it gets easier to trust and feel safe -- I think we also have that automatic defensiveness with each other tbh. We're waiting to get doxed irl, to get sent hate comments and abuse into our irl inbox ig. It is so sad.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Cup_of_tea424  I'm more scared of being followed home by a 30+ year old man because I was nice to him and he somehow thinks we're madly in love now. I mean I live in the middle of nowhere so he'd think I was leading out to off him but it's still scary
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: you are talking about a very different scenario. passing someone on the street, there is no expectations to be nice. you are not working, you have nothing else currently occupying your brain, and you can actually have a natural interaction.   Food service is not nattural, your livelihood is dependent on your interactions with others, and there is an imbalance of power between the costumer and employee.   again, very very different scenarios. you can not just change the environment completely and expect an individual to act in the same manner.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: on top of the unfortunate fact that older generations are more likely to have older outdated mindsets on things like gender and sexuality. as someone who is 20 something, I too am more on egde around older people in fear of being called a slur than a younger person ( I also live in Florida, so do not blame me, lol joking ). These are real biases that we all experience. I try everyday to overcome them, but it can be very challenging. I try not to internalize these discussions about generational gaps though. We are all different people, who come from different places. we all have labels put on us, but that does not mean we can not be anything more, or that we should use such labels to treat others.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: we dont have a future, of course we're sad
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @LuxNovuz  You know historically what people usually did after that?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You make us sound like stray animals that you're domesticating. That's adorable help😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I do so terribly with small talk as an AuDD guy. How do you NTs do it?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@coyenasaregoated I struggled with small talk for a long time as someone with social anxiety - it takes practice and having some go-to lines and responses. I quite like small talk now and actually enjoy interacting with customers and the like, but it definitely took some time and discomfort to get there
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: To be fair, people probably don't look at you like that coz you're nice to them. You sound pleasant to talk to.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a gen z who is trying their best in this crazy world, thank you that really means a lot ♥️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: its not the virus that is causing that but ok , its something else
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: AUUUUGH THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!! Yes we need to be comfortable enough to know we're allowed to show our personalities and we're really chill people to talk to! We don't wear our hearts on our sleeves and we don't leave our doors open. Simple as that. I'm sure based on this you're a lovely person to talk to. 🥹
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: most people are only doing it to try and make a situation more comfortable its hardly done out of malice is how i see small talk and sometime it can lead to a friend
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Really? I moved from the suburbs to the city for college and people greet me on the sidewalk way less. That's actually one of the reasons I hate the suburbs, people walking their dogs or whatever bothering me when I clearly don't look like the type of person who wants to make friends with a 52 year old father of four.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ty. I really needed this because everything is so hard and I’m not even 18 years old yet. (Im 16)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im british and in europe its more the norm to be reserved and antisocial and we will look at you strange if you randomly say hi to us and you dont know us regardless of age
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: and your perception and "sadness" you feel is actually mutual. many people my age (20ish) feel a deep sadness for people your age. I think its stupid. You dont know these people. Your age is also a factor in which people my age respond to you. I do not receive such behavior, as people my age come up to me casually, like we are friends. you are older, you must realize that you are the age of some of our parents, which is not exactly an age group people are comfortable talking to. this goes with any generation. the gap in age is a gap in life experiences. truth is, you probably do not share a lot in common with younger people now, and they very much know that. the internet has seemingly doubled the speed in which things age out of relevance. most people my age expect those of your age demographic to be largely not online and more unaware.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Maybe cause your generation blew up the world, expect us to fix it, and will complain unless we do it with a smile on our faces
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Smaestr I get it bro, but maybe send your ire to a boomer that isn't being kind and understanding in the comments. This one didn't deserve this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Smaestr Man that was seriously uncalled for… this is an actual kind person, go off on the people actually causing harm. Seriously one person in a generation didn’t cause this to all happen.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Smaestr Bro it's not even them, it's like the generations starting from your great great grandfather. We just recently learned how bad everything we've been doing is and haven't fixed it or found a solution for it. We need to accept the responability for fixing it or we can leave it to the next generation like we have been doing in return for our kids living in a little dark age.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Do you say hello back and have manners? That's what's important to them & they stare when they're disrespected. I'm Gen z & never get stared cept by other Gen z
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @ogradus  they don't say hello, either that or if it's an older man they'll actively look you up and down before speaking. Even worse they'll get mad and look at you like you heinously interrupted their playdate by attempting to give them customer service
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the gen z stare is such a weird concept.. like every generation does a stare, gen z just happens to be in retail right now
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If its not getting complaints for staring, its someone else complaining that they arent paying attention to the person talking to them. Wild.  Also apparently gen z is the first generation of humans to master non verbal communication, because ive seen this complaint used when talking about whats clearly glancing over at another member of a group and looking for a look or motion of approval or disapproval from the others before speaking for a group.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a younger millennial (28), and I remember how overwhelming it was when I first entered the adult world—grocery shopping alone, eating alone, going to coffee shops by myself. Everything felt new and a little disorienting. I probably did the ‘Gen Z stare’ without even realizing it, just trying to process everything. When I see someone younger doing it now, I assume they’re just overwhelmed and taking a moment. I try to be kind and patient, maybe even offer a smile. It’s wild to see millennials becoming the ones doing the mocking. It’s not a competition—we’ve all been there
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: my "gen z stare" is mostly just me trying to process literally anything because i'm autistic and have auditory processing disorder
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wait hello I thought gen z stare was only when we’re like a “seriously?” type of stare
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think another point that should be considered in this convo is how quickly ableist it can get. Like, there are people out there who genuinely struggle with social interaction. That one girl complaining about how gen-z wants community so bad and then “calls them out” for also having phone anxiety is what I’m talking about. Two things can be true. Like, I am not officially diagnosed with anything so I won’t claim any labels but I know there is something wrong with the my brain. I genuinely struggle talking with people because it feels like an Olympic sport. It’s like a puzzle I can never solve, and so I’ve developed a lot of anxiety around it to the point where I actively avoid social interaction and end up isolating myself. You hear a lot of neurodivergent people express similar experiences. Some people even develop agoraphobia which is an actual thing. Yes you need to talk to people to build community and that needs to be understood but I also think that it needs to be understood that talking to people is actually really hard for some. Like, god forbid I do the “gen-z stare” while I’m trying to figure out how to respond to you in a appropriate while also trying to figure out what you even said because I couldn’t hear you over my constantly overthinking brain and the constant buzzing that’s always going on outside.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s kinda funny how Gen z wasn’t even the one to come up with the stare and was probably the last to know about it as a “trend”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: okay, so as a genz, i feel like a huge part of the whole small talk issue is that in school we were punished for just talking to our friends in class and in between classes wed have teachers yell at us in the hall that its not social hour and we need to get to class, so most of our time being in person was spent not being allowed to just converse with our peers without a reason other than enjoying talking to them, so almost all of our interactions with our peers were through texting and phone calls, and whenever we would go out shopping for groceries or school stuff with our parents, we would be discouraged from making small talk with workers cause the workers would talk directly to our parents, and our parents just wanted to be done with the shopping, and when our parents were hanging out with their friends, we were again discouraged from small talk and hanging out with them because the adults were talking, so we were actively pushed away from in person conversations outside of our nuclear family.  now that we are adults, they want us to do all the things they spent decades teaching us not to do which is just obnoxious honestly.  also with the whole "we dont owe customers friendliness" i can say that for me and most of my friends, we owe it to the customer to be polite, but being friendly tends to get us harrassed by men twice our age who dont realize that we are being friendly because its our job, and not because we have a crush on them.  and that goes especially for waitresses who then also have to deal with even if the man is understanding about it, his partner may get overly defensive and yell at us for flirting with their man, which all in all has just led us to say we are gonna keep the friendliness for our friends, and be polite at work until you show us that you dont deserve our politeness because were not gonna take being verbally abused for 9 hours at a job that doesnt actually pay our bills
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “Gen Z has bad social skills.” Wow. It’s almost like we went through a major event that forced us to be stuck inside for over a year, severely harming our ability to communicate normally since we couldn’t see anybody in person.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When every tenth customer is verbally combative and treats you like a second class citizen just because you're required to serve them, it's hard to smile and strike up conversation with every single customer that comes in. Sometimes I just want to take the order and move on. This doesn't mean you shouldn't be polite with customers. Just like any other person, they deserve a level of respect and politeness. As soon as a customer starts to become aggressive/rude for no apparent reason, they no longer deserve my politeness, a from that point my only goal is to get them their order and out of my line.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why not both? Gen Z doesn’t have the best in-person social skills AND the public is annoying AF. Multiple things can be true and in my experience both these things are.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What I've been literally taught was that I owe everyone the basics in respect (small talk, smiles if I can, that kind of stuff) but the moment you don't give me the basics back then I don't need to give respect back
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wait I don't get it, isn't it stereotypical young adult / teen behavior, especially in customer service job? Did the 80's not have movies filled with gloomy and unenthusiastic teen chatacters that stared and rolled their eyes at every question? Seems like just a question of maturity.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im just kinda tired of everybody dogging on gen z. like if people want to make their entire personality bitching about how much they hate the most depressed generation alive right now thats not gonna make us be nicer or more friendly to anybody.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The amount of customers who come in ON THE PHONE is insane. But I get yelled at for not greeting them
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millenial here. (obligatory "we know") I've seen the "Gen Z stare" done to people, I know I've given the "Gen Z stare". It's... really not new. It's "The Office Stare" given yet another new name. And you're right that it's a couple things that are being grouped together. Generally though it's a face someone is making because they're processing an interaction that's strange or out of the expected to them. That might be someone engaging them in polite conversation in a place they aren't expecting (older gens often don't understand the social cues that younger gens want to be left alone in public i.e. earbuds in on the bus) and their brain is trying to process switching tasks, or that might be a customer/coworker/stranger with incredible audacity and their brain is trying to quickly process how to survive the situation. Our brains are over-worked, over-stressed, under-rested, and under-stimulated. It's not a surprise to see these fast-paced social interactions slow down. Personally I don't think it's a bad thing either to slow it down. I just wish it was on purpose and not because our brains are overworked.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: idk maybe im crazy but i think this whole "gen z stare" thing is rooted in some type of ableism. like it doesnt matter intentional or not. "they cant socialize!" "theyre so socially awkward!!" "why are they looking at me weird!!" like idk man as someone who is autistic and had to grow up mainly around older people ive heard a LOT of things and this just sounds like (mostly unintentional/subconscious) ableism. these people are just mocking how me and a lot of my autistic friends act too :/   and yes, i know this is NOT an autism-only thing. I KNOW. it's just that this is something very common/rooted in autism. i also include general/social anxiety for this comment too, its just autism is a better example i can explain. having this condition (and a few other mental conditions) affects my DAY TO DAY LIFE so of course its... gonna affect how i appear.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I never have these interaction with Gen Z. All these anti-Gen Z talking points I only find out about on the internet.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s not even that we can’t communicate it’s just that some of the older generations have become insufferable
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am Gen Z - I feel like being told growing up that I'm too loud or annoying or talk too much has affected me a lot socially too. Also, the amount of times I was told that school is preparing us for the real world and then also being told that we're there for work not to make friends, so then I feel like I need to keep work, work related. I also feel like they are registering the pause way longer than it actually is bc they're so used to an instant response. But yes, I have done the Gen Z stare and it was when I was working at a hotel bc you deal with so many people who think that they're always right and know everything. I just feel like there's so many reasons for the Gen Z stare, and not all of them are Gen Z's fault - in fact, I feel like most of them are not Gen Z's fault.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: and boomers are retired and thus shopping in the retail environment
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @n3ptuune and a lot of them can’t read or do basic math from my experience
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i mean it is the older generation that made a huge league of people pleasers, and theyre used to have people answer them and laugh at their jokes out of pure respect. And we want to be efficient at a job, small talk is annoying, i do not own you respect like that, I've seen so many customers forget what they're buying or doing because they started small talk, then you're just sitting there waiting for them to get what they want but they don't even know!! the stare is a communication that we do not want to partake in small talk, get straight to the point, I don't need really any information from strangers and most of the time they don't even respect you but want to be treated like kings otherwise your head will be rolling.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @juliadesouza6674  well said my friend
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @juliadesouza6674   If you can't coherently type out your complaints— you don't deserve to have an opinion. What a surprise that a Gen Z lacks grammar and writing skills.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey, another Gen Z who's offended by being the most useless generation of all time. Statistically proven.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @SikeItsIke this just in old, man yelling at the sky shaking his fist.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SikeItsIke  your age is showing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The whole nonverbal communication thing, I think media helped with that. We have been given ways to converse without words, and we have learned how to do that. The whole pandemic really didn’t help us be social, but at least we can convey what we want said.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: To be fair, staring BLANKLY, and not paying attention are both negative for functional communication in American social standards. There is a sweet spot. For example, speaking too loud and speaking too softly are both not optimal because there’s a typical sweet spot of sound.   I don’t think anyone should judge people who aren’t proficient at communicating, but at the same time, we do live in a social world.  Im a cusper, super young millennial, old gen z in a way a because I just turned 30. I don’t relate fully to either generation. I grew up with and without social media. My younger siblings grew up with it/constant access. We are drastically different when it comes to how we socialize and interact with people.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly, when people started complaining about the stare, I was not only logically defensive but also confused. I was thinking this exact same thing, "Didn't you guys do it as well? Not showing a bubbly expression to you isn't a bad thing." In fact, I heard a guy on the internet saying this, "If you're offended, defensive, or uncomfortable with someone's silence, or someone not being excited to see you when they don't know you (AKA, the retail employees): they don't need to fix themselves, you just have self-esteem issues."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Was just about to say… cuz when we were “y’all’s age” 🤣 they called us entitled, self center, etc. But I think that’s just gen growing pains. The 18-25 of any generation is the “newbies” to society. So they’re gonna have the spotlight on them the most.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I appreciate the use of "processing". the people complaining about the stare are definitely the type to talk at you and only listen to respond. Like, by bad for trying to actually listen to you and articulate an appropriate response to what likely is the dumbest, most self explanatory question ever to be asked on the fucking planet.   These videos play up the stare to be way longer than it really happens, though I don't doubt its that long for the people who can't use their five senses and come to the conclusion that is literally right in front of them
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As older gen z (26) its shocking to me too how millennials were soooo rebellious as teens n open and whatnot for some of them to become some of the most hateful people and turn on us, who looked up to them and believed that they also believed in being the change we were promised to be together when we were young like some of us gen z did...idk. it hurts. Especially now with each new thing that's ripped away every day.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Crybatty  Unfortunately thats every generation. Baby boomers were protesting civil rights, were anti war and pro peace, and now they’re annoying Karens, privileged, rude, and racist/sexist. Gen X was very edgy and anti establishment, pushing rock, punk, and grunge subcultures, and now they are often the ones moaning about “wokeness” online. The oldest millennials are in their 40s, enough time for them to go from rebellious youth, to jaded and judgmental adults. It will happen to gen z too, eventually 😢
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Crybatty  ugh so true. I'll be nice to an older guy and all of a sudden they think I'm into them and when I make it clear I'm not they blame it on my generation being incompetent
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: some people aloa want force small talk and they do that (older people) attention or idk, i fe hate small talk, i do not need to exchange my information with a stranger really and it doesn't help at my job, also here where i live people try to joke a LOT for small talk, mostly men with dad jokes, and it's ANNOYING! I'm not at my job for people to tell me jokes and i have to fake laugh while i put your stuff in a plastic bag. most often than not they forget they're there to buy something because they started joking and didn't give me enough information, so that makes things also more difficult just because they don't have attention and want to joke about shit to get fake laughs and feel good about themselves. I'm not paid to be a therapist, didn't pay to see the clown alright.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​ @juliadesouza6674  I once had a customer ask me if he could tell me a joke and it was the most horrendous unfunny dad joke but he looked so proud of himself and the joke was decent so I just gave him a little clap and said "eyyy that's a good one, nice" then he just kept going and 7 jokes later he was going around telling people I should get a promotion. 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They said i could be anything, so I became a disappointment. Lol, in all seriousness though it just takes patience, patience to understand we all have different needs and we all can grow together through doing so
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a millenial that grew up begore social media, we just had more personality back in the day. Even if it was our first time doing something--we'd just express it lightheartedly like 'Sorry! This is my first time!" Gen z doesn't have this ability to understand that you can communicate your thoughts and feelings. Like they don't have the adaptive ability to go off script and be vulberable. Tbey just stare at you expecting you to understand what they're going through and the problem is you don't,  so it's awkward. Even if you go, "First time?" They look at you like "Are you judging me?" with a deadpan look.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @xjojie  prob bc of online vicious bullying where we don't get the "slack" to say it's our first time. I remember getting my first second third job and each time felt like I just wasn't allowed to make mistakes ever. You can't just go up to your local store and hand in your resume with a smile -- you have to mass-apply online and hope and pray and call and follow up begging for someone to take notice. I think the reality is that ... Gen z has a good reason to feel judged and fearful of the world that keeps staring at them and calling them out for being "weird" and "stupid" etc. etc.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @xjojie  because failure is the end of the world to a lot of us, we've been screamed at and "disappointed" enough people that at this point, there IS NO POINT in trying new things. You'll just get bullied, told to kys, and all the other things. And yalls sadness about our generation just pisses us off more, because yall dont wanna do a damn thing to help.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @xjojie to be fair it's your generations fault with the way y'all raised us. Berating and being told to shut up is NOT parenting and no it doesn't teach respect either. We don't want to be doormats but we don't want to offend anyone so this is the result. The older generations are the most sensitive(regarding themselves) unforgiving and ABUSIVE people you can ever come by and that makes us not want to interact with you. We're fine interacting with each other.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen z stare and Gen z believing that everything in the world is annoying and overwhelming is  because of Gen Z's lack of connection to the real world. Gen Zs also lack critical thinking skills because of growing up with internet.  I notice Gen Zs coworkers seem almost... dumb. Im not trying to be mean but its definitely how it seems in the real world.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @kiaadams104 the real world is irritating and annoying dawg
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It is but millennials and co take it out of context to complain about it lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Mica-208 i'm a millennial and it would simply never occur to me to see somebody staring at me during an awkward social interaction and blame the whole fucking generation. Like are older people just truly not realizing that they also have shitty social skills?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That’s how I use it, if staring at you like this it’s cause your behavior is baffling and you should be embarrassed 🫩
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, when i first heard of it, it sounded like you say “hi! How are you?” And they look at you like 😒  And I’ve never seen that before. I’ve seen a couple of customer service workers that I would consider slightly awkward, but that’s not a gen-z thing. Everyone can be awkward sometimes. But I’ve never seen this rude, dismissive stare-down that everyone’s talking about
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jacksont9455  Yeah I've never been hit with that stare by a worker but I also see that stare as you said something out of pocket or you asked a stupid question and they want the conversation to end. Meanwhile when I get told if something I wanted is out of stock I might ask what they'd recommend if it's not busy or if it is thank them and then leave to see if I can find it somewhere else or go somewhere to get something I'd think is a good alternative.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No that's a customer service stare and everyone does it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It is, that’s what I’ve been thinking, if you or I were to hit each other with the stare we’d instinctively understand the emotions being conveyed. And yet these uncs are out here claiming we don’t understand social interactions because they don’t understand our social interactions…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Everyone has that stare. Not just Gen Z.   They have the prolonged look of contemplation after being caught off guard by a simple question or request.    Not a look of contempt after being at wits end.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It really is and now it’s like I’m doing the stare more because they genuinely think we’re doing this cuz of awkwardness not because the did something or said sum completely stupid
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yea the people hating on the “stare” are the people that were stupid asf and had the audacity to be that stupid in our presence in PUBLIC nonetheless. Its crazy too cause they embarres themselves 🤦‍♀️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m definitely not opposed to reflecting how stupid a question is as a millennial. I work in a call center and we definitely talk smack about people and don’t answer stupid and annoying coworkers on team for a while to let them sit in their shame.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It is, the older generations just don’t realize it. I guarantee you every older generation that’s complaining about the “Gen Z stare” said something so ridiculously stupid that the Gen Z they were talking to couldn’t even process wtf they said resulting in the “what’s wrong with you?” Stare 😂😂😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@Jaxnay219  I get the "Gen-Z stare" over the phone when I try to help people log in.  "This is your username and password.  You can try logging in now." "Okay." after a moment of silence "Is it going well for you?" "Oh, it's asking for my password.  I typed it in.  Do I hit next?"  And it's generally really old or young people (16-20).  I'm not asking for anything but to speak up if there's an issue or confusion.  We'll both solve the problem faster.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: But you use it a lot more than previous generations, we millennials bad mouthed customers after they left, not on their faces.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Puerco-Potter  Yall did the same shit. Most people were there for it years ago, and yall still do it today
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: its more like a "i have no idea how to react because i've only been spoiled into mental ineptitude by my family and school" stare. gen z true personality comes out when they get told to do something that isnt entertaining them lol. then its tantrum time
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @saturationstation1446 ”spoiled into ineptitude”??? Lmaooo Did you forget about the entirety of the pandemic? Y’know, when most of us were still in middle/high school? We were not “spoiled into social ineptitude” we had our chances to socialize forcible ripped from us while a majority of us were still learning how to socialize properly.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @saturationstation1446 just to clarify you know this because you’re somewhere in your teens - early twenties or because you’re 50+ with a child that does this?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @saturationstation1446  what are you talking about?! I work with so many gen Z and the only ones that throw Tantrums are the older Gen X. gen Z is by far the most down-to-earth generation we don't BS anything they tell you how it is and how they feel is it nice no, but it's truth.  have you ever considered that the reason why gen Z acts nasty to you is because you're nasty to them, if everyone in a generation is awful maybe you're the problem. I don't consider everyone in Gen X to be awful just because I've seen a few bad apples it may be a lot of bad apples but 20% bad is not 100% bad.  but go ahead and insult the generation that's paying ssi taxes that's never going to get Social Security smh
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No, the stare is a product of gen zs AWFUL social skills. Worst ive ever seen.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @johnfisher8401  so have you noticed that nobody upvoted you?  That's because you're wrong :D
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @johnfisher8401  by awful you mean we don't want to uphold the status quo, and that we give a sh/t. cuz we don't and we're not pretending we do anymore.  this is only a problem in the US not in Europe where it's not mandatory to have a 24/7 customer service facade unlike the US.  even within the US what is considered polite and rude across regions drastically changes.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @johnfisher8401 If you are the common denominator in so many cases maybe problem is you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: forreal, like, im allowed to be upset about something regardless of how hard you think im working to change it. its rarely as simple as "just go do xyz" because if it was, we would "just do" that thing lol.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I wish more people woild talk about this. I’m sure its a common experience among people who are neurodivergent.   Lack of social skills are often characterized as “weak muscles” and the solution is to train them by talking to people. but in a neurodivergent brain, something else is happening more akin to neurological disorder or damage.   Someone with parkinsons can train their muscles but theyre still gonna struggle to hold a glass of water. The same way neurodivergent people struggle to respond in ways a normal person would, think of normal topics, and have normal mannerisms.   Neurodivergent people actually do try to learn and train their muscles, and this is how they develop the ability to “mask.” Its like if someone with parkinsons could stop their tremor on command but have to exert continuously to do so.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly! I'm older Gen z and diagnosed with social anxiety and get really bad phone anxiety (to the point that I will have a panic attack after a failed phone call). I still yearn for community bc that's just being human. And we live in a world now where phone calls aren't that necessary anymore if it weren't for people still forcing them everywhere.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This also goes both ways though. It’s ALSO ableist to assume that any off putting social interaction or different social interaction is because of a disability as if disabled people haven’t been existing, functioning and being social in society either.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @hello7032  they were bashed on way worse actually so don't act like they weren't already having issues
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: None of this absolves you of the responsibility you have for your own well-being. It is nobody else's responsibility to navigate the maze of your own social problems and it is ridiculous to expect anyone else to do that labor for you. People got things to do and most all of it is going to be better and more rewarding for them than sitting and watching the loading circle in you stare to end.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Reminds me of things like that "millennials are embedding diamonds in their hands" article and millennials being like "this is news to me" people just make shit up about young people lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes💀 I didn’t even know what the Gen z stare was as a Gen z myself😭 I didn’t even know it was a trend too💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Creatures continue to comment. If only there was a Gen Z only COVID. That would be pretty cool.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You are both Gen Z, with likes from other Gen Z. Quiet, humans are discussing this topic.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @SikeItsIke  dude really said “quiet, humans are discussing the topic” like he doesn’t look like a clay sculpture someone dropped on the floor
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Right the pandemic ruined my social skills I used to love talking to new people and making new friends but it’s so hard now after being by myself for that long
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @IJustMakeVideosWhenImBoredLol  SAME
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @IJustMakeVideosWhenImBoredLol no you’ve just been too scared to go out that’s all
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There's also like...they taught us not to talk..they never want to hear us speak any other time why would we talk to you at all
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @salt7625  this is true, its the inevitable consequence of "sit in your chair, dont talk to other people, don't be even midlly annoying or we'll treat you like a monster" for like 18 years in a row. and they dont see the irony in blaming young people for being socially awkward lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ironically the stare is kind of a social skill that is missing from the older generations, if I hit you with one of these stares you’d understand what I’m conveying whereas to older folk it is seemingly a mystery??
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My parents were helicopter parents and we weren’t allowed to be outside so Covid was no different than what I had to go through my entire life. My parents didn’t socialize me properly at all and yes still blame me for my lack of social skills. People tend to treat me bad because they think I’m ignoring them but I just don’t know how to respond unless someone speaks to me first. I have to live everyday like they never did anything wrong either so I can imagine all the other dysfunctional families that will never get resolved.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: During that time I was in 6th and 7th grade so of course my communication skills are not on top
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And I do online school. I like online school more but I don’t talk much if at all all day And I got stuck inside even more because the year I was back then someone got covid and the school had a lockdown for a 2 weeks or more. Then I went online for a bit for reasons of my mom’s work or who I was staying with in the morning. So my social skills kept crumbling. Then I went back to school, but 8th grade I went online and I’m still online now and I love it for my grades and teachers don’t pmo now but social skills are still horrible
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: literally. i was in high school in my SENIOR YEAR. no prom, no senior events. nothing. then get thrown into the workforce
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Girl I was making McDonald's orders through the whole pandemic and the customers were WORSEEEEEEEE. I think the condescending comments transitioning to being about how stupid I look in PPE was AWFUL. like thank you for having to legally protect your dumbass while you need a mcdouble girl GO HOME AND MAKE A GRILLED CHEESE WHY ARE WE LINED TO THE ROAD
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: During the pandemic, I was in the 7th going on 8th grade, and as a child, I've always been to myself. When i got a chance to go back to school, I didn't. I finished high school online and graduated high school during May this year. Sometimes, I do wish I could've been in school, but I realized I would have been having problems like I did when I was in school.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: covid ruined my life fr, I still can't go outside around people without needing two meds at LEAST.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "It's not your fault, but it is your responsibility."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Over a year? More like three years, I did fully virtual college two years and one year half day for three days every week with social distance and masks
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Right. School is one the most important places where you learn to socialize and a lot of students didn't interact properly for 3 years. We were literally told to isolate ourselves for safety ofc we don't know how to communicate
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's so true tho. I'm 16 and I have social and performance anxiety making it hard to interact with people without feeling awkward out of place. I have trauma from the past so it just makes it so hard to communicate with people and get to know them without feeling socially scared of others
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's almost like we've been the first generation with access to an hardly internet influenced world. With social media exploding while most our parents didn't care for mental health With the world outside getting more dangerous and going outside getting more expensive And soon after been hit with a f*ckin pandemic that forced us to be stuck at home for 1 year and a half But nah we're probably just lazy or smt fs
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Everyone was stuck for a year, not just you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @sotiresome  mhm mhm and were you in your developing years when you were locked up?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And it all happened during extremely formitive years of our life. I COULD talk to service workers and people at school before the pandemic, but then when it was over and I was back to school in person, I couldn't do it anymore. My brain would shut down and my voice would lock up. I've been trying to get better but it isn't easy. I hate it and I wish I could just snap my fingers and everything would be all better but it doesn't work like that. It's suffocating.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You can’t blame everything on Covid. It’s the social media and phones too.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Lmao if someone is socially crippled from being semi-hermit for 2 years idk.. hahahahahahahahah
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @JessieJussMessy  if you're stuck in your house as a young person for 2 years you have no way of escaping whatever toxic familial issues you might already have. On top of that if you have parents that get annoyed when you and your siblings are "being too loud" even though they're in a different room then yeah you're not going to know when it's ok to talk or if you even should. It wasn't really COVID that did it, it was the lack of space from hyper judgmental family that caused this. The same thing happens to old people who have no one else around for years
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And its literally worse for us, cuz the brain is not yet fully developed until around 21 years old, and 5 years agos, the oldest gen z was 22. The entire world went through the same thing, but comparing a "30 years old that already spent their entire life talking and interacting with a fully developed brain ging through the pandemic", to a "10 year old that just got to middle school or a 14/15 year old that just got into High school getting trapped inside their home for a year and a half"? Totally different stakes. Not only that, but sometimes, older people are stupid af, asking questions they are too lazy to get the answer for. AND SOMETIMES They wanna make a conversation out of anythink, sometimes i dont wanna talk on the bus stop, or on a waiting line, i'm not interested, and i'm too socially awkward to say that to you, so i'll make a face and ignore it, deal with it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes but it was like a year long and you still continue to shove yourself in the phone constantly. You’re not helping yourselves by NOT socializing in real life. Stop using Covid as an excuse as if it lasted a decade
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly, I think it’s good people lost their will to put on masks and pretend shits OK when it’s not. We’re more willing to just own our truths.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The pandemic was 3 years ago, are you gonna make this excuse for the next 50 years?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Shit happened to all of us. We all came out of covid different
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @romeye  during your early developmental years? highschool is one of the most important parts of your early life, you learn to talk with people your age, couldnt do shit because i couldnt go outside and hangout with my friends, i could only see them in school and when we talked we would get in trouble
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also the year after the quarantine everyone was wearing masks so I feel like staring without a fake expression was normal cause no one could see it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People that came in this comment thread saying "hOW ArE YOu StIll HavIng SoCial AnXiEty fOr BeiNg isolAted iN jUst A YeAr" forget that it's not only social anxiety that people struggle with after the pandemic–there's a LOT of factors as well like depression and severe anxiety. Y'all really can't just say "Get over it" when it's not that easy to get out of, especially when you're in that headspace for so long.  Sure, it's been 5 years, but some people stay depressed for decades while functioning properly and y'all cry and say "We DiDn't kNOw, tHey DiDn't ShOw AnY SiGnS At All" when they choose to commit unalive.  Gen Z's aren't rude or socially inept for no reason. If y'all want them to do better, then be better as well. Simply insulting and criticizing them when most of these people are still growing while you already have a fully-developed frontal lobe tells me that while y'all are fully grown, some of you lack empathy and understanding and that's why you've been getting the stare.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @umiiimu just to be clear what my intentions are: covid didnt cause crippling social anxiety, it just brought it to the surface. Which is why i find it funny to blame psych conditions (which normally develop from perpetual childhood trauma) on covid, when it clearly goes deeper than that. In fact, other than covid making these issues starkly apparent to oneself, its totally irrelevant. Chalking it up to covid thus must surely be a jest. Many in this thread have already mentioned its a cultural thing where theyre expected to shut up and anything they say/express can be weaponized against their character. And I get it. But see, so many people from each gen think theyre unique, and while they definitely are cuz its never so simple.. the bigger pattern repeats, just with nuances every iteration. And while life is subjective to each, i think we can objectively agree that regardless of whatever the "gen z stare" indicates about our society, its very existence as a term is evidence that theres a trend entrenched in our society thats consistent enough to be understood by members of the relevant generation without need for context clues... that is to say that the context of common issues (generational nuances) are already lived experience and dont need explaining. And being that history repeats itself, its not difficult to reason the same-different kinda shit has been happening for generations, and unless we get our shit together itll continue. We are already regressing with MAGA, trynna revoke womens autonomy and trample over the spirit of their suffrage. We should make sure we know where we point the blame so we can at least proceed down a path that aligns our intentions with reality. ​Otherwise imma just laugh at nonsense like op posted, as if quarantine for 2 years was ever really the progenitor of such widespread societal issues 😂   Tl;dr - covid didnt cause your social anxiety
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Be that as it may, it's not an excuse to be rude to others.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @nathankinman7753  How is looking at someone being rude? Y'all are the ones constantly being rude and treating the younger generation like they're incompetent even when you're the who thinks a pizza should be done in 5 minutes
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also, a lot of Gen Z didn’t have issues with being social during lockdown and still currently (as covid is still here), and forced a lot of disabled folks into increased isolation and we’re still not out here omitting any accountability.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Everybody went through the pandemic. Y'all didn't talk to the people you were stuck in a house with?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @olmecsunshine868  not if those people also had to work from home, you had school and those people decide to make every little issue into big ones
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That was one year of your life. You ain't built that bridge and gotten over it?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @AyaDreamsSepiacovid literally changed a lot of lives, it’s been 2.5 years, yeah, but some stuff take some time to change, specially after trauma
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How long are you going to use that excuse?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: But the problem is almost none of yall (I say this as gen z) are working to have better social skills, just rotting and crying about your social anxiety like it’s going to get better on its own somehow and like you don’t need to expose yourself to social interaction on purpose to learn how to do it  And this isn’t from a place of ignorance, when I was younger I had TERRIBLE social anxiety, still have it pretty bad, but I put in the effort and now I can hold a normal conversation even if it’s kinda scary sometimes   Obviously if your anxiety is like, paralyzing, or whatever, and you need medication, that’s different, I know how much you folks like to misread everything on purpose
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How are we still excepting this as an adequate excuse? " thE PanDeMic deStrOYed mY sOciaL sKIlls " ok cool so you're just gonna keep it that way and never overcome that problem? It's everybody else's problem but not yours? Smfh
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @damiondunn4663 FINALLY! Someone else gets it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also the fact that older people have been constantly disrespecting us since we were born making it harder for us to learn social skills
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s been five years. When are y’all gonna stop using the pandemic as an excuse???
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @guineppe3405 An excuse? Covid happened in some of the MOST important times for most Gen Z. My entire Junior and Senior year was ruined and it all happened right when I was starting to come out of my shell more and get involved in different things I never did before in school. When Covid started I regressed immediately and it took YEARS after to fully feel comfortable again. It is not an excuse whatsoever. It was an actual difficult challenge for people.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @guineppe3405  When the side effects of those vaccines go away.   You said it was so simple: just get the vaccine and we can go back to normal life.  You FORCED people to take madicine.  That is not OK.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@guineppe3405  oh plz, i bet ur one of those ppl that think covid is gone 🙄
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ok, while I fully defend yall (as an older Gen Z), you all are not the only people to get go through anything tough, you are also not a monolith. A lot of folks worked on getting more connected and more social in spite of the pandemic.  Just stand by if someone says something dumb or rude, your desire to not be confrontational ever results in Rude seeming passive aggression.  An ounce of accountability will get people off your backs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @hello7032 then they should take accountability themselves
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They had bad social skills BEFORE the pandemic, they have always had awful social skills.  Absent parents, insane phone use, I mean they are an absolute mess. Sad.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @johnfisher8401 wow middle schooler were bad at social skills, when people are at their most awkward.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes, let’s blame 1 thing that happened 5 YEARS AGO for your lack of social skills!! Get a life
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So much this I either spaced tf out or someone said some dumb shit and I'm trying to figure out why. 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This, gen z and gen alpha had  formative years taken by covid witch obviously would stunt in-person communication skills
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: also if you're working the whole day having to do small talk all the time is tiring! idk why some people think it's so easy to work with costumers. it's not, it leaves you tired, drained and numb.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @juliadesouza6674 welcome to customer service! You still have to answer the question no matter how stupid, this is not a new thing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That is more like introvert or socially anxious people response. And doesn't related to any generation. You extroverts are just so entitled
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I would definitely say a lot of people I know are better than most with in person experience, but whenever you try talking to someone they end up telling you about the sweat darlin Debby they met 40 years ago at a music show the every body should k ow about even though there was ten people there and five of them were working
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i was gonna comment about this. im autistic, socially awkward and gen z, and guys. expressing annoyance at strangers IS socially awkward. it is not socially acceptable to show that you think someone is annoying, because that is hurtful, especially if they too are socially awkward and simply trying their best.  yes people are annoying, but you are also socially awkward in how you handle that :P just treat people with kindness thats the best social life hack there is
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The public has always been annoying. Thata not something new or exclusive to gen z.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Everyone can be annoying. What I don't get is  how y'all have no patience whatsoever and yet demand the same patience and empathy from us when you remind us needlessly how you all are  living in the worst timeline
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Lime1958 who has zero patience? Cause id argue that between the genz and  millennials, it is the millennials that i’ve seen have zero patience (tho i am particularly thinking of parenting styles and interactions ive seen the millennials ik have with other people). If i had to pick to be put into an escape room with my gen z sister vs my millennial mother or any other millennial i grew up around, im picking my sister because ik im not gonna get yelled/even more stressed as soon as SHE gets frustrated.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think Gen Z / Alpha perceive the world as “annoying” and disconnected because they have been raised on the internet. Growing up in virtual realities has deep effects on people - psychological, emotional, social - that we are still learning about.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @artlesscalamity  No. People have always perceived the world as annoying. We're just vocal about it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No. You're abelist if you say it is rude to blankly stare at people when they ask you a direct question. I saw someone say this almost verbatim, by the way. They weren't joking.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Abcdefg-tf7cu  I kind of understand because disabilities like autism can make it harder to speak or we need to think a bit more before answering, I am just asking yall to be patient with people with disabilities like that but I will always try to respond, it is important to try but everyone needs to be more accepting and patient in case someone has a disability.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Abcdefg-tf7cu it's litterally not rude though? No it's not "ableist" but it's giving "you'd be pretty if you smile more" Like i have autism(officially diagnosed when i was young) I don't stare to be "rude" I'm genuinely trying to think of a answer lmao.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Abcdefg-tf7cu   stupid people asking stupid questions will get that only
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like this is all a balance between basic respect for othets and self respect and I get why some people give the gen z stare even if nothing "stupid" has been said. Some strangers act like all gen z are stupid so they act stupid but also like, don't stoop down to stupid ppl level.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm an xenniall but identify way more with Millennials. I gripe a little here and there, but I don't quite get it. I always swore I wouldn't dog on younger generations, I try to be helpful, try to get younger friends and acquaintances to be hopeful but like, how can you not get the Doomerism?   I'm kinda like, does no one else my age and a bit younger remember the Great Recession? It sucked. I wasn't even unemployed, just stuck in a place I hated for the back half of my 20s, and it sucked hard. And Gen Z has that going on, only way worse.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah what do they think is gonna happen? When they are too old to anatogize us, we arent going to suddenly start taking care of our abusers and bullies
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's so annoying dude like what's it with millennials online always attacking this generation their children cant read a dr Seuss book
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is how the slytherins felt with they won the house cup and dumbledore basically said “f u guys”  Then were asked to to fight for the school
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's a right of passage. The youngest generation always gets dogged on, until you age into adulthood and you do it to the next Gen 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @shon-too we gotta stop this trend fr  Millenia of generational trauma for everybody   The biggest cope there is
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @shon-too   Yeah the problem is that it's getting worse and legitimately causing discrimination. Gen Z are the first to be fired in layoffs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Complaining about the next generation is tradition. Also it’s very true that being raised on the internet has done things socially/psychologically to Alpha, Z, and younger millennials (lots of research on this). The pandemic didn’t help either.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sure, Gen Z gets a lot of undue flack and deserves a lot better.   The problem here is that last sentence of yours. It’s conditional, why’s it so conditional? Y’all have a lot of bad individualism attitudes that you hide behind willingly. At some point y’all need to extend yourselves or you will continue to hear this remarks.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: But you also get yelled at if you do! Cause then you're being rude for interrupting their phone call :') (working with the general public has made me numb to social interactions.)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a hostess, so this doesn’t happen to me super often because people are expecting to have to talk to a host when they first enter a restaurant of course. When it does, I just give a polite little wave and start cleaning/organizing something until I see that they’re done
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @theroyaljules39  That is annoying I wish they'd have some common sense and just finish their conversation outside if they really needed to keep talking on the phone.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Audio processing disorder too.  Sometimes my brain lags y'all. Just give me a moment.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah I feel you. I have audio processing problems and my facial expressions are a little lagging. Part of the problem is that I stopped intensely masking around middle school and never made the effort to go back. Because it felt freeing and I stopped having meltdowns every other week. Good ol’ AuDHD making life “interesting”.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is such an important observation. Also, anyone who’s calling others “socially awkward” isn’t demonstrating the qualities they claim to be superior in. Having to put in effort to understand people who look/think/communicate differently than yourself is a normal part of socialisation! We require that of minority groups all day, every day. And we also hold them to measurably higher, and often unreasonable, social expectations. This includes autistic people and others with social difficulties - which is a cruel irony.  It is true that every culture develops shared scripts that help interactions go smoothly, and knowing them can also prevent miscommunication. But they’re subject to change! And lashing out when you can’t rely on them? That’s a far greater issue than simply not having a shared script with someone…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: exactly, i know social interaction is necessary, and sometimes even really cool, fun, or interesting, but expecting everyone to show up in the exact same way and when they don't, assume they aren't trying at all, it reminds me of ableism i've seen before. it feels purposefully isolating towards people regardless of intent, and i def agree that these people are mocking how me and many of my autistic friends act as well. ik its not only a neurodivergent thing, but it still feels rooted in that. i am glad to see other people point out almost the lack of acceptance involved in this conversation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am autistic, I still tried to reply when being talked to. A simple emmm went a long way into reducing awkwardness
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s not entirely rooted in ableism, a lot of people will happily co-opt for ableism of course but it’s not all that. It was originally about just teasing that Gen Z…are awkward, a lot of Gen Z really just is awkward, but instead of teasing back, yall create this girdle of defense for yourselves to absolved yourselves of literally any accountability and it’s leading to a lot of the issues plaguing your generation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @hello7032  Or, as a older Gen Z (98) we were raised by a generation that were generally not great parents. Combine that with a better understanding and acceptance of mental health/disabilities, a pandemic that stunted many of our young lives, and an overall very aggressive political environment. Just because we can point out factors that contribute to a problem does not mean we're absolving ourselves. People snapping at us for 'not taking responsibility' doesn't help anyone and just stresses people out. I swear, people act like a generation is a hive mind, we all have individual problems to worry about, being awkward is not the most important issue.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i have a feeling almost every older person who complains about the gen z state where gen z is the customer just ended up getting stuck with bullies. The only other gen z people i’ve met that do that silent stare thing when being serviced are just the ones who bullied people in school ☹️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I deal with this every day. Gen z customer service is the worst ive ever seen in my life, its like they are in a catatonic zombie state from crippling phone use.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @johnfisher8401  i bet you're annoying and wanna have conversations with the workers
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have Gen Z coworkers. They are very awkward and always looking down at cellphone and fearful of eye contact. Strange generation in general, the internet has done some serious damage.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @kiaadams104 gen z coworkers look me in my eyes and are normal
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Agree, but then shouldn’t you be ok with people calling y’all insufferable ?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @hello7032  being insufferable because we don't want to deal with insufferable people only proves we aren't the insufferable ones
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: like i’m sorry im not about to baby middle aged people… you’re GROWNNNNN
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s unfortunate how Gen Z is just generalized to being socially awkward when we forget that there is a wide range of people and a lot of the kids are still learning how to be socially aware, and we also have to think of people who are on the spectrum, have social anxiety, etc. They won’t socialize the same way a neurotypical person does, and there are many nuances to add to this discussion of intersectionality that I haven’t seen a lot of people discuss.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Gen Z I have never witnessed the Gen Z stare amongst my peers or with service workers. Like the internet will take a few isolated experiences & make it into an entire problem….
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 18:25 why is she talking about us as if gen z is one person??? Like she wouldn't stare at the person who asked something really stupid. Why poke fun at our anxiety? I puke every time I need to answer or make a call. If you don't have anxiety I can share it with you. Try it. It's so fucking easy. Nobody disrespected her personally with the those short videos. She started it first. Now gen z doesn't owe her anything.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Does anyone remember how in Zoom classes the teacher would ask a question, and then there would be a longgg awkward silence (where all the students would just keep their mics turned off)?? Every time the teacher would eventually give up and just keep talking  - my theory is that we've basically just grown up using this technique of like,, if someone says something you don't want to respond to, just subconsciously knowing "oh if I don't react or respond, eventually they'll move on to something else"  It feels like that thing where alpha bros would say you shouldn't say anything when a conversation goes quiet to encourage the other person to keep talking?? but really off-centre
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: maybe it’s just us thinking before we speak…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I wait for the other person to speak first on the phone when I think it might be a scam. On occasion, a legitimate caller accidentally gets that treatment and I usually apologize when that happens. I do this because scam callers will often hang up and not call back when they think there’s nobody on the line and they don’t get a voicemail message.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Calling something a gen z is also a massive generalisation. Generations last 15 years and currently the youngest people in gen z are 13 and the oldest are 28. It's completely different for a 13 year old acting very socially awkward in public Vs a 28 year old.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 8:25 The person saying that the mindset of not needing to be friendly to customers is "insidious" would have a terrible time shopping in Europe. The customer service culture expects a lot less obsequiousness from employees there
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 18:45 Ok I get what she’s going for but words cannot describe how much this person pissed me the hell off.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Can we just stop commenting on and assuming the worst of other people. We really have no idea what people are going through. Some people are socially awkward, its really not that personal or that deep tbh
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i think the internet majorly blows this out of proportion, too. the entire world is online now. people are going to see and hear stuff about things a lot more. that doesn’t automatically mean it hasn’t happened with younger people for decades, just that now everything gen z do is online whereas it wasn’t years ago when other generations were the exact same as teen/young adults.   people compare their generations based on the people in their small town growing up, against the entire worlds gen z.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i really need people to start clarifying what age group they're talking about because as a 23yo i don't interact with any gen z who act like this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: my experience as an early 20s gen z is that stare theyre talking about? the one where the server makes small talk and gets met with silence? is not fucking happening. at least not in my entirely gen z circles. if they are responding that way it's because theyre either baked as fuck or have severe social anxiety
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This might have to do with my autism but i don’t understand why is small talk so important? like cant we get to the point of the conversation while being respectful and nice..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The problem with the gen z stare is that it's targeting a lot of people with autism/adhd/anxiety or a form of introversion that make it hard to communicate. There's also the case that the stare could just be them trying to think before they speak unlike what the person exchanging conversation with them is doing. A lot of older people expect a smiling face, and constant pleasantries even if they themselves are being jerks or making it difficult to be nice. (plus they could just be thinking and that's their thinking face. I was told I had a gen z stare but I just make confusing faces because I have a hard time expressing emotions with my face, I remain silent when I think unintentionally, and I'm shy.)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 11:33 international pop star lara raj?!?!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think an element to consider is that genz has grown up with 90% of phone calls without id being scam/spam aswell as people filming public prank content and being told not to give any personal info/show to much as your house to avoid being doxxed and/or harassed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I gen Z stared at my coworker because they asked if “BBQ sauce goes on the BBQ wings”. Like YALLLLLLLL we are just 1st graders at this point
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: maybe im built different but if someone stares at me i just stare back lmao we both got eyeballs and now we’re using em
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you!! I also have auditory processing issues, so a lot of the time when someone's talking to me, I hear mumbling. This especially goes for music. But back on the people, I just have to sit and process for a second, and then I continue on with my usual customer service voice and answer 'as expected'. I also do not show much emotion; I've had a friend watch my facial expression because I was confused as to why people never could tell what I was thinking or feeling. Turns out, there is no difference between me being surprised, happy, content, and a poker face lmao. No wonder why people can't tell what I'm genuinely feeling.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, but past generations had that too, and the complaints aren’t there about the social awkwardness.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ZZZ3R0_0  yeah cuz they killed em all in the past
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And ykw? My favourite video about having debilitating social anxiety is from AmazingPhil   A near-40 millennial
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That started before the pandemic if you were in college 😭 my freshman year I was the only one that would talk (then my freshman year 2nd semester the pandemic hit and it got worse)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@notreallyafamousartist695 when did you start? I started college in 2018 but only noticed this behavior post pandemic tbh. But that might be a major difference too
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No bc even now in class irl I'll still do that unless I alr know the answer off the top of my head bc if I don't I'll spend the whole duration looking for it, finding it almost immediately, and still sitting there bc I can't bring myself to say it and risk being incorrect 😭😭😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I had zoom classes in university and for me, I have to unmute my mic to speak, and in general I’m not good at knowing when it’s “my turn” to talk even irl. So it’s harder on zoom to tell if someone else is about to speak, worse yet if people have their cameras off. Also it depends on the question, if they ask something like “did everyone get a copy of the textbook?” If I have one I’m not going to answer “yes” because me having one doesn’t mean everyone has one so I would say nothing, because that is logical. I don’t know if everyone has a copy of the textbook so I can’t answer that question. If I know I don’t have one I could say no, but otherwise 🤷🏾‍♀️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's always happened in classrooms online or offline.  Teachers either continue on or force someone random in class to answer. The second solution has caused problems in classrooms and feels like an adult is picking on students (probably thousands of stories of the least liked kids being called on in class by a bully teacher).  So continuing on is becoming more norm.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Omg I remember this exact thing happening in class and with my mom too!! Whenever we were arguing and she'd ask me a question, everytime i tried to answer she'd act like I was "talking back to her" so at some point i just learned to stay quiet and let her answer the questions herself. I feel like the whole adults getting mad when you "talked back to them" (literally just answering questions they asked or defending yourself), at least in communities of poc, couldve played a small part in that too, but idk🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: babe its not a zoom thing all students have done that in every generation..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @crazy_1_was_crazy_once the classroom scene of Farris buelers day off when the teachers explained recessions 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @crazy_1_was_crazy_once  you clearly don't know what they're referencing though. Just because every generation does it, but it's being normalized amongst a vast majority that even other people from the generation noticed it as a problem clearly shows that it's a problem
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: nah because my teachers would force someone to talk if no one spoke up 💔💔
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This has always been a thing in classrooms tho, it's not new or correlated
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This was originally what the Gen Z Stare referred to and it didn't stop happening when kids returned to classrooms IRL. The teachers I know describe it as seeing the kids literally just giving up trying to learn anything because they know the answer will be given to them if they wait long enough. There's no motive for them to learn because they all think AI will tell them everything they need to know in life. It's genuinely a concern to all the older generations watching the kids grow up pre-cooked, and y'all would know that if you saw how some of these teachers cry for you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @saiyamoru  Everyone likes to complain about AI. AI is not the greatest thing in the world, but it isn't the bane of education. The education system needs to basically be remade at this point (in the USA) to start teaching kids things that will actually help them, and let them pick paths they want to take before wasting money trying to find things in college. I went into cultural anthropology and editorial English, sitting through math classes for thirteen years (including the ones you're required to take in college) did not do anything for my life. IMO after freshman year, you should be learning life skills and exploring career paths, not worrying about trigonometry.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think my head just exploded because I never even considered that!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ..... That last paragraph is why a lot of men don't get second dates now   No one wants to have the burden of conversation constantly on their shoulders. No personality and boring
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No, my zoom teachers only wanted out mic muted
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's why I quit teaching. How is a teacher supposed to know if the class understands things? And then the teachers get in trouble for it, too. smh
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is such an astute observation and makes so much sense
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: lol fr thats why they get so pressed, they dont do that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 34& I do the genz stare . I didn’t know that was a thing until a few weeks ago lol . I’m an awkward person. It’s not intentional . I think we should give Genz some grace & we also have to realize that they aren’t a monolith , just like not every millennial is the same not every gen z is the same .  The worst interactions I’ve ever had were with people in their 50s,60s and 70s . Those ages of people , usually talk too much and give unsolicited advice .
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Perishena1 I don’t want to be rude, but you have a valid point about the talking a lot. I don’t mind advice at all but it usually ends up with them talking a lot lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No, it's not.. because you never say anything after the stare.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You are slow, it's okay. It won't get better.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SikeItsIke  When half your comments get deleted by youtube, maybe it's time to re-evaluate whether or not you're being an ass 👍👍
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was taught that you dont say "yes" "Sure" or anything that is agreement if you think it's a scam, cause they could record it and use it to commit identity fraud.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this is why i say 'moshi moshi?' when i answer, most scam callers are looking for a standard english greeting but real callers will recognize it as a greeting from my tone of voice. my dad does the same with 'nihao'.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just press red if I dont know the number. and usually the scam caller numbers are easy to recognize as well, they follow a pattern.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Scam callers know when you answer the phone. Your just letting the know the number belongs to someone
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @DanYeLL2003 I wait until they hang up. Maybe I’m wrong, but I figure they won’t call back if they had to hang up on silence the first time. Sure, they know something picked up the phone, but they don’t know if it’s actually a person or just some piece of IT equipment. Hell, it could be a broken fax machine for all they know.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't speak when picking up the phone because YOU called ME. If you're not smart enough to understand that the one who prompts the conversation (makes the phone call in this case) is the first to greet then you're not worth my time, simple as that.  When I call someone and hear them pick up, I'm saying hello and giving them the reason I called.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeah i heard the germans get down right offended if the cashier tries to talk to them, i wanna move to germany
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @ClippyForConsumerWrights I work retail in Germany and I can confirm this. But it's not the best either. Some refuse to speak so much that a simple greeting is too annoying to them and their entire body language reflects that aswell. 90% of the time, costumers that don't reply to your greeting are major a-holes and are just the worst entitled ones.  Now than there are these that answer with one word replys, which is the majority of costumers here and are quite easy to handle.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Related: a lot of the conversation around this whole “gen-z stare” thing REEKS of ableism. Like sorry I have a resting bitch face, i’m autistic what do you want me to do about it? I’m not obligated to mask for the sake of people who feel entitled to a fake smile.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm so glad someone else was annoyed by her
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @HYPERxSONICxFANx2012 literally, people are in other people's business too much
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ive noticed older people are very fast to assume maliciousness or incompetance instead of very normal human error.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fair. We will start to assume that this is the best you have to offer - and because this is the BEST we can expect from you, we will very reasonably, deem you not worth investing our own time and energy in to.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @u4iadreams  If we're not worth investing your time and energy into, then why bother leaving a comment?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @u4iadreams  on the contrary, since you may assume that everyone is trying their BEST, given the circumstances you can extend a little GRACE from that high horse you're on ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've experienced it exactly a handful of times, the majority of gen Z (and honestly gen Alpha too!) have been polite to me either as coworkers I'm training or as customers I'm servicing.   I've actually experienced the "😳😐" from older generations because they're using ffing telepathy and not asking directly for shit 💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @lotsofuwuenergy3983  "I've actually experienced the "😳😐" from older generations because they're using ffing telepathy and not asking directly for shit 💀"  THIS IS SO TRUE!!!! the hypocrisy!!!!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's because this is a chronically online problem. Some of these people sound impatient and lacking on self awareness and others are perturbed by the audacity and trying to cope with the otters' behaviour. The Gen Z are getting confused and these people aren't thinking how they could've contributed to the confusion.  I teack on a college, Gen Z age range on average, I haven't encouñtered this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @availanila  I probably have experienced this but it's never bothered me because I don't expect to be treated like a queen just because I'm deciding to purchase goods and and or services I literally just expect to get the thing I ordered/ paid for and that's about it. I don't care if the cashier smiles at me or asks me how my day is I know they aren't paid enough to do that I get my stuff and I get out like a normal person.   Besides the person doing this might be autistic or mentally unwell or something and since I'm autistic myself I wouldn't want people judging me for that and I treat other people the way I'd like to be treated. So I'm not going to go off on someone just for not telling me how super special I am at their minimum wage job where they're probably struggling to survive.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @availanila  I personally have encountered this issue on the number of occasions. however it's grossly exaggerated online
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've noticed the gen Z stare ONCE and it was my 16/17 yo coworker. I'm 27 & haven't seen ppl in their 20s rn do this stare lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Have seen the 'Boomer/Lead Paint' stare a lot recently tho
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Right bc I’m gen z (24) but younger people in gen z are still teens and we have very little in common
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And some of us are literal children cause its up to 2012
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i think there's technically allot of overlap for people in their 20s because my siblings are apparently both. personally i think of generations as the next generations kids so i dont expect to fee a real difference until gen alpha.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Literally same, I haven't had any issues communicating with anyone in that bracket, but I'm also an extrovert so maybe I just don't have the right perspective in that regard?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same. Why is it so hard and ""rude"" to get straight to the point? Girl this is BK and there are 10 people in line behind you, this is no place for small talk.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly. To me, conversing with an actual deep and meaningful conversation isn't bad, that's great! But small talk seems so fake. The concept of small talk literally sounds like, "I don't want to talk to you, but this is my idea of being nice, so I'm going to talk to you even though I really don't want to." And no one has to actually partake. Some people do get offended when someone is dry with the small talk, hot take: Work on your self-esteem, because it really isn't that deep.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: exactly like, i feel like this sorta lumps all short conversations into small talk, but not all conversations like that have to BE small talk, they can be about something real and not just kinda going through the motions bc you're "supposed to" (which not to mention, eats a LOT of your energy for a relatively low reward). i am not a person who is silent either, i talk a lot, so the second i resort to small talk instead of anything more substantial is usually the moment the other person has lost my respect and i no longer have any interest in letting them know anything about me. (not always, masks being what they are, but you'd be surprised how often)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i fully understand your line of thinking
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: to me small talk is for filling space. like, if the machine is running really slow and we need to wait for it to load, THEN i'll ask how their day was or how the weather's treating them. but when the small talk is getting in the way of me helping someone i often end up on autopilot trying not to sound annoyed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @LillethTheRabbitExactly. I have no issue striking small talk with the person ahead of me in line or waiting for my turn. But I am NOT striking small talk with the guy I am supposed to just ask for their fast food order as a cashier
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What gets muddied in this discussion is what small talk we are referring to. The impersonal game of canned questions there are a limited number of undetailed "correct" answers to is indeed trash. This is what both many sociologists and pretty much everyone who dislikes small talk mean. Conversation on functionally unimportant subjects, as a form of bonding with strangers? That's fun.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @TheCompleteMental I mean the type of small talk that you’re forced to do..If the point of the conversation is about something unimportant then it’s not small talk..it’s just a conversation and the point is the interest..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @TheCompleteMental  THANK YOU. this whole thread was so frustrating because everyone is clearly operating under a different definition of small talk.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Without taking a psychology course I can see why you don’t understand. Small talk is about body language, mannerisms, and getting comfortable to then say something that’s on your chest. No one wants to feel bombarded with heavy topics right away if you’re a stranger or a friend. You need to feel out a conversation to be comfortable and read how the other person is doing, then you start talking about the heavier stuff.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The way I ran to the comments to see if anyone else caught it😂😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was thinking the exact same thing 😂 I love the eyekons
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I THOUGHT THE SAME THING LMAOOO
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yea the whole not saying hello on the phone thing is stupid when you consider that most random calls you get are scammers. and god forbid your new number used to belong to an old person, now you get hundreds of calls from scammers a week
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Given that some places call all wings buffalo wings, its not completely absurd to ask for clarification
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactlyyyyy! I only stare when people say something real stupid shii but I'm not allowed to say anything that will hurt their feefees
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @thesilentdiva who on earth has barbecue dry rub?!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think that in this situation you describe, that was slightly rude of you. Sometimes an obvious answer isn't so obvious, from experience of working fast food and franchise chains.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @gothicanimeangel96 brother he was a delivery driver who hs worked at dominos for 6 months at that point. He had done wings before and still asked. Like brother we are both 21, I don’t need to babysit you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @gothicanimeangel96 Context Clues are also a very obvious skill one can use btw :3
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @gothicanimeangel96  If you're in a chain they most definitely have the recipe written down if it's any more complicated than you take this premade food pop it in the oven or microwave and you press this button.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I can’t stand small talk, especially because I am 24 and am usually working with people twice my age, and unfortunately a lot of them suck
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Almost like quarantine is just a fancy word for isolation and we lost social skills for 2-3 years
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just wnated to comment about Gen Z socially awkwardness cause my first job i really struggled talking to people and i feel like i tried hard to make effort i always answered back to questions whenever asked (this was not a customer service job) but going into a job it does feel like you are joining a school or a club late and relationships are already formed and it honestly just feels like no one will really give you the time of day. Like yes i am very socially awkward but i also beileve there is a sense of older generations not really caring to get to know you either so its just awkward for everyone.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 20:14 tbf I think on the most part when the "I don't owe them this" excuse is used, it's often in response to people who think they are entitled to our pleasantries and engagement. Not so much that we never want to try, but that small talk is exhausting (at least for me) and when you work an exhausting job sometimes the easiest thing to do to alleviate some of the burden is to drop the hellos and how are yous. Because they're not always necessary to get your job done and you're running on low energy. It's not so much an excuse not to engage with people as it is a defence from people who think they are automatically entitled to us doing more than just our jobs. It's nice to be able to, but it's not really fair when people demand it of you and antagonise you for not making the extra effort.  Also on a train journey there's enough time to have an actual conversation, but at a coffee shop counter for example there typically isn't. Which means you don't really get to connect at all unless someone is a regular. And half the time if you try to steer small talk in an interesting direction, the other person stops engaging anyway, because they only spoke to you out of obligation, or some kind of automatic greeting process. Which isn't connecting either. It's hard for me to consider making small talk a real aspect of building a community really.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly as a cashier who has seen people of many ages, it's the older folks that tend to have the stare more than anyone LOL (I'm talking 40-60). I ask them "hi! how are you?" followed by them not saying anything sometimes.  And the younger millennial/gen z have been generally nicer and more responsive.  (although I'm sure the experiences vary from location, this is just my personal experience)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: not to be a brat but not all blank stare at an older person is due to seeing them as below you basically in some way, because that’s what it comes off as. i find that in my experience, that stare is honestly a necessity when you find yourself in a situation where you know the other person simply lacks the capacity to understand you due to them being too stuck in their worldview/ways, and you being very intuitive if you can sense that if you were to speak and be honest, the other person would get triggered and would respond to you with what will undeniably end up draining you and you just have to accept that they see you as a kid and they will just invalidate you and insist that they know better. so naturally what you’d rather do is stay silent and keep your peace
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This generation label stuff is exhausting.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Growing up getting told “don’t talk if not spoken to” “adults talk first” i was taught to shut up. Now im the adult and the transition of “oh yeah now I do talk” hasent hit. So many of us were taught to be over considerate to where we wait for others to speak and we don’t feel to fill the lul in conversation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hate how we find little things to hate about each other. People are so mean.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im sorry for the audio quality...maybe i shouldve just stared in silence instead
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What I’m seeing is people want a constant acknowledgment that they’re being listened to, such as “ahuh, aha, all right, OK, yeah,” instead of just being stared at because it makes them uncomfortable, and in a sense, their minds are running thoughts on what the other person is thinking about them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I watched for now to 6:32 and I must say no I never did or witness other gen z people just staring blankly and not answering at all , if there is the stare is usually when someone is rude or annoying and then they talk after the stare, the vid examples aren't really true for what happens in those cases, maybe some people really do but not the majority of gen z
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also, as someone with autism, this "trend" makes me insecure lol. I stare a lot to over correct my awkwardness and I also have an audiotory process disorder, which also causes me to stare until what someone just said to me clicks in my brain. And maybe it's just me, but I feel even more judged for it lately
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ve realised the biggest likely reason WHY the “gen z stare” boils the blood of so many people in older generations, especially when the gen z person in question is working in customer service or any job. It’s because we don’t have a big fake customer service smile plastered on our faces every second that we are on the clock or interacting with other people, whether they be coworkers or customers. If we stood there with a big fake customer service smile the entire interaction, it wouldn’t even matter if we didn’t say anything during short pauses in the conversation, or at least it wouldn’t matter anywhere near as much as older generations say it matters. It’s because we aren’t constantly cheery and delightful every second that we interact with another person that gets under their skin so much, they don’t even care if that cheery and delightful attitude is fake and put on for show, they get mad when you don’t smile at them, regardless of whether they smiled first or if they are being rude or not. Even with casual small talk, older generations get mad that we don’t pretend that we actually give a crap about how their mundane weekend was. So often I find that older generations are satisfied enough if you just give them a half ass white person smile in passing in response to them saying hi to you. It makes them uncomfortable that we don’t cater to their discomfort and do everything we can do remedy that so they’re comfortable. How do I know that it’s the fact that we don’t smile constantly that gets under their skin and makes them so mad? Because my first ever job in customer service, I was working as a waitress in a local restaurant that was the favourite spot of people 60 and older and I was freshly 18 years old. It was only my second shift and I was wiping down tables and chairs while being really bored because it was 4pm and the restaurant had just opened and there were only 2 or 3 customers there at that point, including a man in his late 60s with a very extreme pot belly, who just kept staring at me without looking away while I continued to wipe down tables and chairs. It was a mundane task and it was basically empty, and I also wasn’t aware that anyone was creepily staring at me the whole time, so I obviously wasn’t smiling and was doing the “gen z stare”. About halfway through wiping all the tables down, the creepy old man called out to me as I was only one table over from where he was sitting, and said I needed to smile at all times while I was out on the floor, even if I was just wiping down tables, so I gave a brief, small smile before going back to wiping down the table. That wasn’t enough for him so he got up from where he was sitting and walked up to me until his face was legit about 3 inches away from mine and said “no, that’s not good enough, I’m not letting you go back to what you were doing until you give me a proper smile and keep it”, I could feel his horrible hot beer breathe waft over my face, and he stayed standing right there until I gave him a smile that he was satisfied with. Mind you he had literally backed me up against the end of a table so he was blocking me in and I couldn’t escape him, I could feel the back of my legs digging into the edge of the table as I tried to move my face as far away from his as possible. And he was just a regular customer! Not anyone from management or anything!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was dignosed with autism at a young age. Sucks that people made what i do completely on accident a joke or insult...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: See I always called it the “office stare” because sometimes people do something so stupid I have to stare into an imaginary camera
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I haven’t noticed it. I took a part time job in retail and literally haven’t seen any of the young cashiers do this. What I have noticed is they’re not dealing with Karens like we did 10 years ago. Some of the stuff I dealt with back then was crazy. Had one lady upset I mentioned a migraine to another associate, although off the clock. She called to speak with a store manager and said we were talking about her. Another mentioned that I wasn’t talkative because she was White. I literally greeted her, ring up her few items, and told her to have a good day. What conversation were we supposed to have that she didn’t initiate? Most customers do not want to yap about nothing for two minutes. Some even get upset. The default is just to greet and dassit.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I will say, there are two things that i think cause this "Gen Z stare" in me.  I find small talk extremely exhausting because it's both shallow and dragged out. I get what you mean by the whole "it's a way to connect" but a simple "Hello, i hope you've been having a good day!" will do. If your morning sucked, i don't mind hearing about it, if it was great, i don't mind hearing abut it, but Instead they'll ask me about my day, say something out of pocket i don't know how to respond to, and then after we exchange goodbyes they KEEP TALKING. The older generations also seem to feel this need to dance around a topic or issue which is both annoying and draining. Like, just say what you mean.  Other than that, sometimes i just get stun locked lmao usually when i'm tired and then someone says something quietly and i can't hear it. My brain is just so jumbled that it doesn't occur to me to ask them to repeat themselves, and then i am sitting there trying to decipher what they said and it ends up just being me looking at them like O_O
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I remember the first time going to a restaurant after lockdown, i was literally TREMBLING while giving the waitress my order and i immediately started crying the moment she walked away. Now, my social skills have gotten a bit better, but i still can not for the life of me start conversations, fill lulls in conversation, talk on the phone, or talk to people in public without fumbling my words. And i wish it was an exaggeration, but when im in those social settings and i feel that its getting awkward cuz im not saying anything, i want so so badly to talk but not only does my mind blank, i literally physically cant open my mouth to talk. Its a mix of the social development stunting from the lockdown when i was in 7th to 8th grade, but also the amount of times things ive said have gotten me ignored, looked at funny, disregarded or dissed on. Its so nerve wracking to talk to people and i hate the fact that im so self aware of how bad i am at it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Like fr as a guy who works in customer service I could not give af about your day I don’t give af how you feel I’m not your therapist I’m here to scan your useless trash and get to the next person   And I love how the older generation want respect when they rarely give it in the first place
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: nah i js dont like talking to ppl who i dont know i feel u tho lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: idk how people do online learning all through high school. i had to go online for the last half of grade 5 and then did it for most of grade 6, middle school all in-person and same thing now in high school. i'm already distant, private, and socially inept, i have no idea how i would've developed social skills or made friends at all if i hadnt come back to in-person learning.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Are y’all the only ones tho? You act like ur the only people that went through the Pandemic, that’s also still going on and continuing to isolate disabled people.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @hello7032 ok? This isn’t mutually exclusive from my case and point
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: no babe, quarantine is quarantine and it was implemented to save vulnerable people and not let the healthcare system collapse. There are things more important societally than you and your social skills. I swear, you're 2 comments from going qanon because of dumb tiktok nonsense
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @lenas6246  Quarantine quite literally means a state of isolation. Nobody is denying what you're saying. You are fighting the wall whilst ignoring the actual conversation to address points that weren't even made. Quarantine had an effect on people socially. That is a fact, idk how you misconstrued op's words this bad 😐
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @lenas6246  I'm not sure they're trying to imply otherwise. Of course it's more important to save people's lives and keep everyone from getting ill, but it's still good to acknowledge that the quarantine DID have an effect on the social abilities of many people as a consequence, myself included. I could be wrong though, maybe they were genuinely trying to say that we shouldn't have had a quarantine, in which case yeah you're right.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You are right, but it is on you to then work on your skills. It is over and you have to do your part. I do not want to be mean, it just is what it is. We all needed and need to overcome struggles. The okder you become, the more struggles you have to overcome.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@BBBB-d1f8w  Yes but demonizing the 'struggle' and not addressing the root cause of the 'struggle' definitely does not help the 'struggle' either!! I wish I could just wake up one day and feel less socially awkward, but for now, I stare. Not to be rude, just to process. Change doesnt happen overnight and we need to let gen z grow instead of stifling their chances to. I mean, the mass laying off younger generations based on biases needs to stop. Its hard out here. I think we could be a little more understanding of each other, gen z and older generations
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You guys had terrible social skills BEFORE the pandemic anyways😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes!! I had an office job back in 2018 and was told "my shyness is a problem" during my performance review. I was the only non-middle aged man on that side of building*. I tried, made small talk, but after weeks of most of the Gen X'ers not making *any effort, then no you're just getting a basic hello. I was always friendly and conversational with the 3 men who actually tried. But I gave up on initiating small talk with the others bc at that point... I can only assume you don't want to interact. Just simple pleasantries at most. Why waste both our times when you keep showing you couldn't care less?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the majority of this comes from being so isolated to your own generation. all the generations before were far more integrated into society and didnt feel like the world revolved around themselves or that only their generation mattered in any way shape or form like gen z does.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This happened when I worked at Target so I’m with ya
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I asked where the restroom was and was stared at counter worker.  I would have taken a finger point, a head nod. I didn't need words. I just needed the bathroom. I waited until they were done with the other customer. I was polite.  And just a stare. Nothing else. It was awkward and uncomfortable. I just wanted to use the restroom at a place where I'm a paying customer. If there is no restroom open for customers--just say so.  Another customer finally told me where it was--it was hidden around a corner blocked by planters.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No fr , people are dying and we’re arguing about this 💔
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The full saying is that the customer is always right in a matter of taste. The brain-dead people I talked to on my it service center job were ridiculous. I had a 22-year-old who didn't know what a USB port was. I had a lady who couldn't log in to her pc because she used the number pad on her keyboard for her number in the password, and the numlock wasn't on. I could not get her to understand she needed to push the num lock key. Thankfully, someone who was competent came to the rescue. The most annoying things, tho, were when you explained what to do and they would ignore you and do something else, then get mad when it didn't work. It is like why you're calling if you're not going to listen.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @FacePlant1324  Being fair to those people num lock is not intuitive at all (i'm a swe and worked in computer repair shop). Saying things through the phone even with professionals things get confusing.    I can agree with the ignoring you part but we take for granted a lot of things that are "obvious".   And i've also seen younger people who can do everything on their phone but you give a windows computer (if they use mac) or vice versa and their brain locks. I've also seen young people who don't know what a powerpoint is. There's a wide range.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i wish i saw this comment before i spent 5 minutes pausing and unpausing the video trying to adjust my computer. My mac mini is standing on a kraft mac and cheese box rn
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Listen I’m autistic and I was grown when I realised that was a thing you’re expected to do cause bro if you’re talking I’m quiet cause I’m focused on listening not making noises.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I HATE when people do that "ahuh, aha, all right" stuff. proof that everybody's different.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: its crazy cuz there is nothing i hate more than a customer who needs to say yep uhuh okay after every single sentence during check in lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When I worked at McDonald's, there was no thought behind my eyes other than, I want to go home 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: and it's honestly kinda just sad, the gen Z folk doing it are overworked, underpaid and barely treading water, they simply don't have the willpower to muster the facade, which is honestly incredibly depressing when you think about it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: LITERALLY. like older people are so often assuming the worst like I’m judging, nah I’m just tired
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I used to do that, the affirming that I'm listening during the conversation, and I got yelled at by my previous manager (either younger Boomer/early Gen X) because I should have, apparently, been nodding, looking at her and saying, "Yes, X" in those exact words. Mind you, she would often come to speak to me while I was in the middle of doing my job, cleaning, writing reports, in instances where I couldn't just stop cause people were still coming in and out and would need assistance, and I needed to finish this stuff before I could go do that. And I would also get yelled at if I was working "too slow" if I did stop mid-way to do all of what she was asking. I honestly don't know how much of it is this or how much of it is people just wanting to see us jump through hoops cause what else can they say about Gen Z if we're just functional human beings who listened to our parents' teachings when they told us "Look at me in the eyes when I'm talking to you", "Don't speak unless spoken to", "If you have nothing nice to say don't say anything at all"? Our biggest sin as a generation is being socially awkward sometimes in part because of a pandemic that was foist upon us right when we were about to reach adulthood or going through our critical stages of adolescence. Not even tech can be used against us because we're also some of the first people older folks will come to when they need something basic with their computers or phones fixed and we move into an increasingly technological world. (I'm not saying any of this as a critique to you, honestly just ranting cause I WISH it was just affirming to people that I'm listening to them that was the issue.)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I come from a family that over does the uhuh hmhmm yep thing and I do it less but I still do it and a while back a girl I was seeing got upset with me cause I kept interrupting her. I was like wut I was actively listening
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The fact that ppl have gotten annoyed with me over the phone because I don’t do the active listening dialog… I get the following: *person is talking and I’m not saying anything  Person: “Are you there!”  Me: “Yes” Person: “Well you’re not saying anything” Me: “Well you’re talking…I’m supposed to talk while you’re talking”  Person: “Oh”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So it's all really just insecurities?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don’t think that’s it. Many of the examples are of people asking direct questions to effectively provide a service or a customer is waiting for a verbal cue from the worker to signal they are ready to check you out with a “I can help you now” or something similar.   I hate small talk but certain situations do require words to be spoken
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Amanda-xx7sj  I mean the only real example I saw of that was the lady doing the skit about getting a coworker to exchange numbers with another. And I took that pause as contemplating whether or not to just say no I dont want to talk to you guys outside of work hours.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Amanda-xx7sj  thank you for saying this because this this comment was a drastic over simplification. Like wanting to get a response when talking is basic communication skills if I feel like you're not listening even while you're at your job and it's a requirement I'm going to walk away and leave.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Amanda-xx7sj  because of course they’re not making this shit up for TikTok views
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: we need to remind people that they are not entitled to know what others are thinking
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @banquetoftheleviathan1404  And you need to be reminded that answering direct "yes" or "no" questions is not "demanding to know what you are thinking." Get a grip on reality and quit pretending you are the Messiah or the main character of the universe.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: when i clicked 'read more' i did not expect the big ass wall of text on my screen
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @froggrassy lol sorry, I’m the type of person who can’t just tell a bare bones story without any of the smaller details, especially for a topic like this which I am very passionate about not only as a gen z but also as someone who previously worked in hospitality and dealt with people being mad about my “gen z stare”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Some customers have too much time on their hands one time a customer complained about me for being too friendly and too happy???? Like what??? And I have a feeling that customer is probably crying about the Gen Z stare today.  Not to mention the fact that being berated over things that were out of my control and being segually harassed was a daily occurrence and I was even physically assaulted a few times.   I can't blame anyone working in customer service for not wanting to smile and make small talk they have to deal with the most horrible people on a daily basis.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I admittedly danced with him for a sec

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you initiate the call, you initiate the dialogue, so you speak first. Otherwise I hang up. This has yet to interfere with any professional or personal interests but has diminished the number of spam calls I receive
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The “gen-z stare” is just something old people made up to make them feel better about the fact that they ask stupid questions
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a Millennial and ngl, most of the criticisms levied at ya'll definitely were levied at us as well and it did impact our ability to find jobs and how the elder generations treated us as well. There are still people who forget Millennials are all full grown adults to this day and still talk down to us like we don't know what it means to be grown and pay bills. We also had that hustle culture so were expected to break ourselves for nothing or even free internships as well and considered ungrateful, childish, terrible with money for buying occasional treats and entitled as well. Omg, once we graduated college with severe debt, the generation that demanded we go then criticized us for not understanding how loans work, for assuming we didn't work to earn money because "when I was your age, I paid for college with my summer job!" despite them not even looking at the cost of modern day degrees, accusing us of majoring in things like basket weaving and the like and also stating "well if you knew you couldn't afford it, why'd you go?" but if we didn't go and worked entry level or blue collar jobs, we were still told "should've gone to college" and used as examples for children to do better. I remember it would sting because the messages were repeated so often that I started to internalize it. As adults, we still get hate for "soft parenting" ie, not screaming our heads off at our children 24/7 and not beating children within an inch of their life because apparently Boomers and Gen X were "fine" and even credit being abused essentially for learning how to become a functional adult.  I think the one distinct major different splitting Gen Z and younger from Millennials and older is having hope for a better future. If you don't thinks could ever improve, you stop trying. Now I don't feel like anyone believes the future will be better and I think everyone is acting really terribly because they think there is no future anymore. Or at least, not one that's worth living. That's super depressing. But I think everyone is a little bit slower to process (hence anyone from any generation having that stare), less patient and less understanding of others. I think the general population has an empathy problem and people just believe the worst possible things about others. It's like no one takes anything in good faith anymore.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The "gen z stare" is literally just people switching out of customer service mode. That's just the "really?" Look, you know? Some people just dont have common sense, and Gen z isn't afraid to show the "really?" Emotion on their face. I do it to everyone as a gen z teen, but it's just because some people dont have manners or common sense. It's like some people were born yesterday, they act brand new  Edit: I saw some more examples people were giving of the gen z stare, and in the actually rude situations where the people just arnt responding, I see that a lot in the teens at my school too. I honestly think that teens and kids of my generation think that having to talk to the employee is a "cringe" or "embarrassing" task they have to do. Sometimes I see them after talking to an employee giggle to eachother as if they just interacted with an old person coming out of no where to talk about the blue sky. And its the mean girl kinda turn and giggle, yk. Some kids are just rude too, I can't defend everyone. But some people really just can't believe the audacity of self explanatory questions (i.e., "are you going to the bathroom?" Right after you just said you were going to the bathroom. It's just a kinda stupid question)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The thing about small talk positively affecting the community...dude. When im working my customer service job and a customer ASKS ME how MY day is, I feel super happy for the next few hours
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 18:50.   Wow; I don't say hello when I answer a call because that's the keyword that automated call centers use to verify a person is on the other line before their script plays. It's so much better to answer the phone at work with the business name to easily reduce time spent on a phone call that you think may be a real person, but is just a really well formed AI. And to answer with "This is ____", or "You have reached ____" with your last name on a personal call for the same purpose.   Am I old?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Amazing points made in this video, as usual! One thing I would like to point out is that your examples of GenX and Millennial stereotypes are those given by GenZ, but the GenZ stereotypes are those given by older generations (22:05). If we zoom out and look at the way older generations talk about the youngest generations entering the workforce, it’s ridiculously repetitive. GenX, Millennials, and GenZ have all been accused by their older generations of being: entitled, cynical, disloyal, overly sensitive, lost, lazy, no work ethic, and hard to work with. I think, as a younger Millennial (34), the big difference is how information is consumed (constantly) and therefore how prevalent the stereotypes feel (extra loud). Which sucks and I feel bad for those younger than me experiencing this. It hurt for me and my peers to be called all of these things —to have our characters questioned in click-bait headlines— in the early 2000’s. So, I can only imagine how shitty it feels for GenZ going through the same attacks on social media.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: if i ever DO have a gen Z stare at work its because ive been asked a question no one who allegedly graduated should be asking me "does the pistachio pastry have nuts?" or "can i get a coffee" while the giant menu is right behind my head.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The whole point of “no one owes you anything” is honoring the small efforts that go into those acts of kindness and communal spirit. No I don’t owe you anything, so if I’m making the small talk, or holding open the door, or going out of my way to help you it actually means something. So sick of the polite niceties of boomers only to be actual assholes in any active setting. The bare minimum is to not make someone else’s day worse. Anything beyond that is a positive.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have literally never heard a single good thing be said about small talk in my entire life but now that gen z is killing it all of a sudden it’s “bring back small talk” what happened to small talk at work”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 7:44 I am the one with social anxiety 😔 i feel bad because I shut down completely and cant look at or speak to anyone in groups one on one i can function but if anyone else is watching me i can't i just dont work
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I love how older generations judge younger ones... like brother..we learned from you!!!😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When I experience the Gen Z stare, it's when they are the customers. Not the employees.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I dont owe people anything, because older people have been telling me the world/society owes me nothing. Cant have it both ways. I agree, if we are to live in a society, we do owe certain things to people. But people like to play that both ways when its convenient.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m Gen Z and I’ve noticed that when I have gone in to interviews, if I include my age/birthdate in either my answers or on my resume, they seem to discount more of what I say. I was even told after an interview to not include my age, as many hiring managers don’t want to work with Gen Z bc we’re considered lazy or entitled. It’s just kind of sad that our entire age group is being looked down upon when most of our circumstances (which we could not control) are what made us a certain way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Like how else are you meant to respond when personal space and boundaries are completely ignored
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a Gen Z worker in my 20s and I speak for most if not all of us when I say the amount of times I've dealt with older Millennial's and Gen X Karen's and Kevin's as customers is honestly infuriating, I'm even surprised I haven't just rage quitted. They ask stupid question's like the costs of products when it's LITERALLY on the menu or "Why is there cheese on my burger?" when there is an option to order without cheese aka the hamburger. Now when it comes to small talk what these older people need to accept is no one is obligated to talk to you or be your friend especially in the workspace, I came here to do my job and go home or serve customers food, I will speak to you politely and get you your food but I am not here to be your best friend, for you to tell me about your daughter's graduation, your pet cat or trauma dump on me. No one cares. Us Gen Z's have no issue's interactIng very well with each other and younger Millennial's and actually are very outgoing and social why? Because we understand each other so we always can have good conversation's. It's just the older that people make it difficult to not look at them confused because on top on having to deal with their constant "the youth these days..." remarks they make trying to understand them impossible and don't know how to tell when people just aren't in the mood. If Gen Z's have "a stare" issue or whatever the hell that means then older generation's struggle with understanding social cues and not knowing when to STOP F*CKING TALKING .
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It is a little funny that Millenials threw out the whole "We won't treat younger generations as poorly as older generations treated us" the second they could start belittling Gen Z for not meeting their social standards lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This feels like getting bullied for having trouble talking to people, though I can give compliments try my best to make small talk and seem positive when in public but every time I do I don’t get a response sometimes or a very positive feedback and then I feel like I messed up or people just don’t like me so I’ve started to try to not to to the store a lot. Also a lot of these “Gen Z stare’s” just seem like people resting their face like what you see everywhere when people are walking down the street it seems so normal but people talk about it as if it’s some weird facial expression. Someone can be taking to you back about having small talk and things without moving their face a lot, it feels like people are just complaining that their server didn’t put on the customer service voice and one of those big fake smiles witch is weird because you shouldn’t have to force a big smile if your face just doesn’t move like that on its own like you smile but it’s not big and someone thinks your not being nice to the customer. Honestly I think if people talked to each other like they cared not like they’re trying to pretend to care which is what people with the “gen Z stare” seem to do sometimes. All this just doesn’t seem like it’s coming from a good place like people need to change themselves because they don’t look approachable enough when they were just genuinely trying to to interact with people around them because they are forced to be around others. And I feel like gen Z has a easy time talking to people when they want to and who knows maybe they just aren’t having a good day, im my house and around my friends ifvthey don’t want to talk to me right now they don’t have to because I’d rather them talk to me when they’re feeling better then get mad at me or be upset while we talk and sometimes forcing yourself to talk to people when you don’t want to found make you feel worse, but in a job sitting you will just have to talk to people. For someone like me I wouldn’t mind standing in silence while my stuff gets bagged i give them a thank you and they say your welcome and give me my receipt and I leave. I would think that as a successful interaction.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm gen z, born 2002, and i gotta say, while i do normally stay quiet and leave the house with headphones, i love talking to random people sometimes! Compliments, talking about an insane thing that happened before our eyes, the weather, its all actually really fun! It also does put a smile on my face since i dont see my friends on a weekly basis. I think we need to shift the view of "i owe you nothing" to "it costs me nothing to be kind" you know?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i say hello first automatically & then i hang up if the other person doesnt reply in 3 seconds. im 16 so its not like im ever expecting any important calls but yknow.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I gained many loyal customers during my 6 years in my customer service job. It was truly one of the highlights of my shifts whenever my regulars would come in, excited to see me specifically.  I was watching some of their kids grow up right before my eyes. I was watching some of the high scholars become college students.  I became a bit of a staple in some people’s lives, and the same thing in the other direction.  And one of those bonds was reciprocated on my last shift. One of my regular Sunday morning families (a crowd that can be tough to win over) gave me a thank you card, and I legitimately cried because it meant so much to me to be appreciated like that by my customers.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a GenZ, I always have been lauded for how "amazing" my customer service is, but honestly, trying to cram social interaction like that when I'm asked to be efficient and have 30 other things to do is just... something that I cannot do. I'm always kind, go out of my way to help people, but I always have efficiency on my mind first, and when something like "how are you" gets thrown in, I hate having to give a non-genuine answer. It feels more like an extra point of power over us rather than genuine interaction, and I had to learn that the hard way, as an individual with ASD, that they expect you to answer with "good" or something positive, even when it's simply not the truth. It's just... inefficient and unacceptable in my opinion.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i personally hate it because my day is spent at work so its not an interesting or particularly good day but you cant say that because its seen as negative and doesn't follow what theyre expecting you to say, but i dont like lying so i have to find some weird roundabout non-answer while just wanting them to get to what they want from me. it seems like its a very per-person basis. id much rather a compliment or something that actually shows thought and kindness rather than a hollow lie-expecting question, ya know? some people are just wired differently
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: small talk is a plight and benefits nobody. if you dont want to have an actual conversation or to actually Talk About Something there is no reason we have to exchange useless pleasantries. I work at a grocery store and I greet people walking in, I say "Hello" or "Good morning," sometimes they just say hi back and sometimes they say "Hey how are you," as if it's a reflexive meaningless thing to say, and then I say "I'm good how are you?" Because if I've learned anything it's the correct inputs to win the social interaction. I'm not sure this is how socializing is supposed to work. It's soulless and meaningless. Every time I tell someone I'm doing good I'm lying, they don't genuinely care about how I'm doing, what's the point?!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @nOwOrnovember  this is factual, objectively wrong. Small talk exists as a form of low-grade social connection, it is a way to demonstrate that you see somebody as a person and therefore are worthy of a brief social nicety. It's a way of saying that you see someone, you see that they are a person like you, and you are both doing a brief acknowledgment of the other before moving on. It's also a way to create a low-grade connection that opens the door for deeper conversation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im fucking not. i hate when people ask me how i am. we all know the only acceptable answer is "good" and nothing more.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As someone in customer service, please for the love of god do NOT ask me how my day is, it's nothing personal but I don't want to have a conversation with you when I'm ringing you up or whatever, I'm trying to get through the day and go home, if you need something, ask for it and I'll answer or help I'm fine with that unless what they ask is unreasonable, but no I honestly do not care about your kids or wife or husband, I'm more so wondering if I can even afford dinner for the day.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jamesfitzgerald8267 thank fk someone said it. Neither one of us actually cares so why ask? I just wanna space out so I can finish this dumbssa shift easier. Working your life away just to still be broke is a hard pill to swallow.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: maybe im weird because if someone starts asking me questions I immediately get defensive, like why do you wanna know things about me. What are you planning? What are you trying to do? It sends red flags up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hate when they do that we both know they want me to lie and don’t actually care about the real answer so why ask then get butthurt if my answer is anything other than “good”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Getting reminded you’re a human being and perceived and considered is always a top tier feeling
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Small talk is nice sometimes but not the majority of times. When a customer asks how may day is my answer is "I'm here" or "Ask me after work" because I'm at work my day is not good rn but it might be later.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Jesus some of you guys are just allergic to people trying to be nice to you huh
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For real. Everyone keeps saying that gen z is overworked, as if the rest of us are retired not working too just trying to get by with a smile too 😅 like if we all take equal responsibility in showing kindness and the most minimal affection for each other as working class, we are always better off. That includes less disrespectful customers and less disrespectful employees, it’s all cyclical. and we can’t wait around for the world to stop burning to decide it’s ok to be nice and smile 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: honestly this kind of thing make me feel so anxious ;-; it feels like theyre putting this invisible expectation on me to return the energy and i never feel like im meeting it. i honestly just hate when people get too friendly in general- teachers, customers, coworkers, tutors. im not there to make friends, im there to get something done so that i can go home and hang out with my actual friends or do something i enjoy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Every interaction during the day is an exchange.  When people go to an overpriced coffee shop every day to get a coffee they could make at home for a fraction of the money, they want convenience, yes, but they also want the social ritual. It's a place they feel that they fit and are welcome.  It sets the tone for their day.  When you work in customer service, and I have worked in customer service,  basic social politeness goes a long way in smoothing the road.  People will often match your energy. And yes, sometimes you get complete toads in customer service, but sometimes just basic kindness can turn a bad situation around.  I actually like customer service jobs.  Everyone is so miserable these days.  Sometimes I wonder if people are so committed to "I don't owe you anything' that they realize that in most cases you receive back what you put out in the world.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: remember, you are only talking about well off eurocentrics behavior. the actual majority of each generation is usually the opposite of what the well off eurocentrics were like. we just dont get considered because in eurocentric culture, only born well off people are counted as real human beings that deserve to be alive. otherwise the minimum wage wouldnt be 15x lower than the cost of living...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: wrong, the whole "no one owes anyone anything" is exactly what divides the US and is exactly why there's no community in the US
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Isnt it weird how gen z are simultaneously that AND the new "participation trophy" generation depending on the argument being made? Sure is convenient it is that way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i mean it doesn’t hurt to open a door for someone genuinely 😭 not entirely necessary, but it’s at least a more positive action overall
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Shouldn't we want to normalize positive?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @veerow6035  But are niceties really positive? Performative niceness isn't actually being positive when you're either A) lying, or B) going through the motions.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Small talk usually doesn't even provide information about the person you're talking to (and in the reverse as well)! Tell me about your hobbies, your aspirations, a project you're working on! I don't care abt the weather, I have eyes and can look outside for that😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @iamThatSandwich  Ok so then you need to decide then what you want from people. All this sounds like this “I’m not going to participate unless it’s on MY terms and people have to be comfortable with MY terms and what I want.” You hear yourself right ?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: But yeah fr, work small talk isnt thrilling. 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Small talk is where you learn social skills and also just participate in society as a person. Y’all so damn reactionary with your arguments I swear
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Because no one wants a “my dog just died and I need a lil hug” randomly. You gotta make space in the other persons mind for you to be a person and not a stranger
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @fishpig003  sure, but generally no one that wants from nor wants to say that to a stranger, no matter how good the small talk was.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: OH NO! SOMONE SAID HI TO ME AND ASKED ME HOW MY DAY WAS!! I'M SO TRAUMATIZED!!! Grow up
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm pretty sure small talk is just the first step to making community if the moment and people are right. Just joined the coolest friend group ever just meeting someone while I was out. Putting yourself out there is a good thing usually! So much anger and bitterness directed at a littleeee bit of effort.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Unless you take a psychology class and understand why small talk is a thing, I understand why it sucks. But it’s more about reading body language and being comfortable with conversation to then reveal the real talking point that is in someone’s chest.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel you girl. It’s just so overwhelming sometimes to think of the “correct” thing to say and also keeping a polite/nice face the whole time. Like I literally just get so tired 😴.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sorry if i just sound really annoying but i think its cues you meant to use because queue is like standing in a line,  but also i really agree with your comment, a lot of gen z workers are disrespected just for being young, like they tell us get a job then when we do they make it hard for no reason 🥲
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Older generations tend to forget that they are part of the reason that we are the way we are. You were our parents, siblings, or role models. We learned what was right from watching you and from the responses we got from you.   I was raised “if you don’t have anything nice to say don’t say anything at all” so…. I don’t say anything… and then they get mad bc I’m not talking like??? Sorry, I’m trying to not hurt your feelings by saying the 4 mean things I thought of first.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I didn't even know the Gen Z stare was a thing until now lol. The only time I really stare at anything is like when Jim stares into the camera and breaks the fourth wall in the office or if I'm trying to come up with a way to say something in a kosher/halal manner.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ok my gen z’s… let’s look out for gen alpha!!! I’m tired of the punching down
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think a really good point I came across was that if you expect someone to actively listen to you doesn’t that person need a little time to process it and think about what they want to say? Are we not supposed to “think before we speak” like we’ve been taught for ages???
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Is it just me or are those videos of people in public not even a Gen Z stare? Those videos are literally just making eye contact and listening to what the other person is saying before they respond.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 4:45 millennials are literally too social to the point where it feels forced and awkward to communicate with them. They are the Disney, panic at the disco, theatre, expensive taco/burger generation. Like how old were those people that were singing Starbucks orders to a flatscreen while recording it? Right
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a gen z im actually the most engaged and social person at my workplace i try so hard to engage with other people and try to know more about them but all they do is respond with shallow responses or ignore me completely. Its so disheartening.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For me (older gen z) when I’m doing the ‘gen z stare’ what I’m actually doing is channeling the cartoons I grew up watching, where when some bullshit was going down, the characters just stood there with a blank face blinking a few times with the cartoon “bink bink” (or similar) sound playing in my head. I don’t do it in everyday chit chat, but rather in fuckass situations where I genuinely just need both myself AND the person speaking to me to take a mf second because what???
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I swear to god this gen z stare “problem” didn’t exist before last month.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i think one thing people are missing in this conversation is perception.  younger people are perceived a certain way. people hate us and look down on us, so any negative thing one person our age does must be true of all of us. we are considered lazy, entitled, useless, anti social, but imo young people are the hardest workers ive met, and theyre often incredibly kind in public or simply neutral, not ever mean or rude. its the older generations that make me feel hated for being young. its fucking hard out here. im struggling to just take care of myself and i literally have the easiest job ever so theres no reason for me to be exhausted but i am. im incredibly unwell and have been for 10 years. I make all this money and it gets me nowhere because one bag of groceries is $50. so forgive me if i dont put on a show and present myself in a way you agree with.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I typically don’t talk first when I get called because when I was a kid I believe my mom told me that a scam caller could hear my introduction and use my voice to make fraudulent claims in my name and that scared me so bad I just wait for the other person to talk now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 15:59 could this be a consequence of mandala effect ? It's way too frequent that people are certain they've had something that was never there! Perhaps in a different time though, it was
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That is basically “big city stare” not specific to gen z. I wear it when in that environment, totally different when I am back home.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's really funny to me how everyone complains about gen Z's social awkwardness, yet every single one of us was raised on the same stranger danger talk along with the internet and being expected to navigate it safely, by our parents, and then corporate spaces started diluting conversation in loo of company time. Of course we're gonna be slightly socially stunted. Working in restaurant spaces I've had a million different older customers who ask for or say the most outrageous things: I had one older man who came in I greeted him "Hi, Welcome in just one today?" And he just mad dogged stared me and then proceeded to call me a slur (I had a pride pin on my apron) and DEMAND a different waitress, so yeah sorry if 4.00$  an hour and tips isn't worth being verbally berated. Another man who was just incredibly rude and would make misogynistic comments constantly who then had the audacity to complain about the service. Times have changed, don't treat your servers like shit if you want good service? Kinda sounds like common sense.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: gen z who was in last year of middle school when covid hit. my social skills are irreparably stunted, and im fully aware of that, im getting better as i work full time and interact with my coworkers alot (luckily not customer service) but its so difficult, the stunted social skills from the forced isolation compounded with my anxiety and autism is really just hell in a handbasket
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You also gotta remember that most of us zillenials/ zoomers that work in retail or food service usually have to work like 2 sometimes 3 jobs or side hustles (not to live comfortably) but to just BARELY stay afloat in this current economic climate. We are burnt TF out!  The future isn’t looking too promising for us. There’s gonna be no pie or picket fences at the end of the finish line of life for most of us. Hell we’ll be lucky if retirement still even exists in the next 60 years.   We can literally smell and see the bullshit that’s being dumped on us by those few in power…. even though we are powerless to stop it or change things for the better.  So yeah, we are gonna zone out or disassociate from time to time as we rinse and repeat living the monotonous stagnant slave wage life style of today’s corporate world.   We aren’t intentionally trying to be rude… we are just trying to get through the damn day without letting our intrusive thoughts win. Sorry for the rant.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: what you said about gen z just not having a lot to look forward to in life is exactly what i was thinking this whole time. i'm about to be 20, and most of my friends are in college and working multiple jobs just to keep food on the table and pay rent. i do agree that some of gen z is overly rude and has issues with communication, but i also think it's hard to blame some of us when we know we're going to be clocking out of one 8hr shift, going to the next, and still have to worry about homework when we get home. i mean, would you be happy and all chipper to go to work knowing that all your efforts won't really mean much in the long run? i think there's a lot more socioeconomic reasons and explanations to the "gen z stare" than just "they don't know how to socialize" or "people ask stupid questions".
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a mental health professional, I'm a big believer that there is purpose in contributing to a better culture, and culture itself can have a huge impact on mental health. In my life, I've lived in spaces where you could tell people were only interacting out of politeness, and there was an air of judgement. I've also lived in environments in which people tried to make small moments positive, were more friendly than they had to be, and sometimes even showed genenuine interest. I just feel like doing the bare minimum and being critical creates an air of bad faith to the people around you, and a lot of people with social anxiety would actually be right to feel unwanted in an environment like that. Even if you're an introvert, having a space that achknowledges your existence and offers small signs of support where possible is much warmer. For a generation that seeks connection and genuinely cares about mental health, I feel like large-scale social social patterns could be such a way to improve these priorities. I understand that Gen Z's developmental context and external challenges can explain why they're less outwardly warm and socially savy, but the coldness of some current trends can perpetuate the exact concerns they want to solve.  Anyway, I love your nuanced perspectives and respectful yet honest content!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think a really cool discussion point and an important one, is how younger people’s absolute fear of being perceived at all or even as “regulars” at places short changes them socially and community wise.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sometimes all you can do is just look when someone says some dumb shit lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bro yes my mom is a millennial and she talks A LOT it’s so awkward but sometimes it’s actually a good thing, she frequents Starbucks a lot and she has yapped to them so much they know her order BY HEART and gives her free drinks. It’s a double edged sword really
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My lord. I was working as a server at a bar. I answered the phone, thank you for calling "restaurant name" and for 20 minutes, I had an elderly woman insist we sent her the wrong bag of ground coffee to her address.   I explained that the only coffee we sell is drip coffee in person. We don't sell coffee online, our website sells nothing, just says our address and number. I told her she must have the wrong number. I said this is "name of restaurant".  She insisted I was wrong, and that she had ordered from us before. She said I must be mistaken and continued arguing.   I'd repeatedly have to put her on hold as I had 5 tables to wait on.  Finally, I asked her, "Who do you think we are? Who do you think you're calling?"  She said, "Name of coffee shop up the street."   I said we are not them. You have the wrong number. She finally realized and said, "Oh."  No apology, no nothing.   As far as the gen z stare, I'm a late millennial, and I found I've always done this when someone says or does something so stupid I have to buffer how to translate moron. Often to customers, my boss, the general public.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Okay that might be why I don't notice it. I live in close proximity to a big city and that stare is normal to me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Just pull yourself up by the bootstraps" - boomer, retired 10 years ago
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: we are not powerless. we must band together and fight to stop this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't care if you gasp have to work a job. Also, if you call something a "side hustle" and not "my second job," you are not struggling. You are an aspirational, social climbing worm who is actively destroying the economy by buying stuff you can't afford with money that doesn't exist.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Agreed. I am Gen Z and trying to be friends with anyone my age is brutal. They think working to establish a relationship with others, get to know anyone, or caring about someone else is a chore. Its incredibly disheartening and they're always falling out w/ people and trauma dumping instead of finding stuff they like to do together.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think it’s also important to note lots of women/fem presenting people don’t feel safe making small talk. So many times people end up being creepy. Even in customer service jobs, being polite or nice to someone often is taken as flirting(WHEN IT CLEARLY ISN’T) I find it interesting no one brings this up in this “debate”.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sometimes i don't understand what older people want, as i was always told to not speak unless spoken to and just being told not to talk back as it was rude? While i was literally answering their question.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I had an older customer ask "if i store this dough in a warm area will it like rise" and i hit them with the stare.  Like, i fucking hope so, thats the fucking point of yeast
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m not socially awkward, i’m actually really good at communicating and i’m a barista that has perfected the small talk, but i will still stare. I’m staring to either: 1) give you time to rethink what you just told me and correct yourself, 2) because i just don’t know what to tell you, because im that surprised, 3) i just like how you look and want to look at you, but this option is usually followed by a comment.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a person who was practically mute from racial bullying since I started elementary to early middle school, finally went somewhere I was able to speak my mind, then not even three years later I get stuck indoors for the pandemic, move again, and then suddenly am in a place that doesn’t give me the time of day for a simple hello or thank you and shove me out the way. Some of the jobs here literally have mass employees walking out on them because they overwork them.   Perhaps. I am in the wrong here?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh my god do millennials not realize that the gen z stare is not even real 😭 its literally the CUSTOMER SERVICE FACE and a misinterpretation help
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as a gen z that works in the service industry i have almost never had young people give me the gen z stare, or have not had my greetings met by someone just staring at me. but 90% of the time older people (gen x and up usually) are the ones that come in and just stare at me until i say something and often times even after i do greet them i get met with stares until i have to lead the conversation basically being like “what do you want”. i find when i do the “gen z stare” it is always because someone is asking me the dumbest question and sometimes it is towards another gen z person.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a gen z with diagnosed social anxiety who was in Highschool for all of covid, covid did NOT help my issues with socialising. BUT.  This whole generational attitude of “I don’t owe you basic politeness” bs has affected my confidence and ability to socialise WAY more than covid ever did. Like before it was “oh I am terrified, but I can still say hello on the elevator and ask how someone is doing or how their day goes, I just will be internally screaming the whole time!” Or “okay I need to hype myself up for a full minute beforehand, but I can still compliment that girl’s outfit because she looks amazing and I wanna make her day better!” Now? I WANT to do those things, but I’m so scared that the person will be offended that I interrupted their day that I just… don’t. I smile and nod instead of saying hi (unless the other person says hi first, obviously). I don’t compliment the outfit 9 times out of 10. I don’t initiate small talk. I don’t do anything unless someone else initiates it first.  What sucks is I do enjoy talking to people - I’m an anxious mess the whole time, but I so rarely get to talk to anyone at all that the few times I can have an interaction really make my entire fucking month. And this new attitude of “I don’t owe you anything = I refuse to interact at all” has stripped so much of the confidence I had to work years to get. I hate it. I don’t want to be like this, but I feel like I have to.   I wish people would realise that not owing someone something doesn’t mean you can’t do it anyway if it’ll make the world nicer. Yeah you don’t owe someone politeness if they’re being an ass, but you shouldn’t be the first rude person in any given interaction. Just be a normal and respectful and kind human being. Be someone Mister Rogers would be proud of. Self respect, boundaries, and basic social decency are NOT mutually exclusive.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I personally hate the over analyzing of Gen Z. This stare comes from the older generation putting ipads and screens infront of their children instead of actually being present with their child. Now this generation has grown up and simply lacks socializing skills. Don't blame the ipad kids, blame the poor parenting skills that created this affect.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I work in a store that caters to all ages and so we have a lot of older customers. I sometimes genuinely do not understand what they are talking about, maybe because of the "outdated" words/sayings they use, so I just give that awkward smile or say something like 'yea', but if they are asking something relevant (about the clothes, about the price, etc etc) I will answer all their questions and explain everything 5 times if needed.  I think this mostly stems from the fact that I did have training and do have knowledge on how to handle/respond to work related questions, but that didn't include how to react to some personal issues with your family for example.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i havent seen the gen z stare but 70% of the highschool kids I've seen serving me, my parents, other people in public actually suck at their job, they talk as if they dont wanna be there and are a little quick and rude tbh. like they dont really look at you, act as if you should know everything already.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What sticks out to me is our small talk culture is unique and not normal world wide. What we are witnessing very well could just be a cultural shift towards a more closed in culture towards strangers. I've been to many places where people would only conversate with you if you are their close friend or they have to and it makes me think perhaps what we were doing before was more strange. I don't blame gen z, likely they're just being singled out for being the next young generation entering the real world but I hesitate to call them wrong.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here. The problem is and always will be that people are afraid of change and/or egotistically think their generation is the best. Gen z will say the same of gen alpha, and so on and so forth.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 22:30 millennials had a decade or more of "killing" every industry in existence before Gen z was the new target. I feel you guys
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Brother I worked at a car wash. EVERY DAY we had someone typically old who didn’t know how to put their car in neutral and when we’d explain they’d yell at us that we don’t know what we’re talking about until they finally listened and would smile in your face 🙄🙄
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: An interaction i had at my first job, in 2016,  "hi can I get a chicken cesar wrap."  "Sure, what kind of tortilla? " "No I said a wrap."  "Yes maam, what kind of tortilla would you like?"  This repeated 4x . Asking the same question to the same woman. This 40 yo woman didnt know what a the wrap is wrapped in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I love how the people who raised us are criticizing us because they dont think we aren’t socially normal enough, whatever that means. Like you were supposed to teach us how to behave in public, if you think we are doing it wrong, thats on you, not us
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 22:19 as a millennial, we have been called lazy, entitled and horrible employees too… it sucks and it’s unfortunately not unique to just the gen z generation, or the millennials. We just gotta keep pushing forward and proving the older generations wrong.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think part of problem people (I) have with "small talk" is that you aren't really expected to be honest. If someone, especially while you're at work, asks you how your day is, what you're "supposed" to say is "good" "fine" "all right" even if you are having the worst day of your life because, shockingly, the customer doesn't actually care how you're doing. Maybe you can get by with a joking "living the dream" or "still alive" or something like that, but when the small talk is default expected to end in lies, I just don't see the point in engaging with it at all. Now, if my coworkers ask me how its going I can usually be a little more honest because we both hate our lives and can laugh (in depression) together. This is why I'm so glad I don't work as a cashier anymore; I can and will put on that act, but it's so goddamn draining. Also I hate customers. Yes, even when I'm a customer. People say the dumbest shit and it boils my blood. I work as a to-go-shopper now (carts are marked with big "[storename] TO GO") and I had a guy walk up to me and ask "so you shop for people?" ??? Yes????? I don't shop for robots, so yes. And people are constantly taking our carts even though THEYRE CLEARLY FUCKING LABELED AND SAY "EMPLOYEE USE ONLY" IM GONNA SCREAM JUST USE YOUR EYES
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The reason older generations like to do this is that they physically cannot take accountability for how they raised the next generation.  It's cope.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes, they act like you should know everything when something they don't even know 🙄   Had a girl at all walmart sarcastically read out a coupon but she understood it exactly opposite to what they said she just assumed I was in the wrong 😑 when the problem was she wasn't trained to use coupons. And then her supervisor also wasn't train to use coupons but instead of saying that they both misread the coupon out to me and said maybe that's why it doesn't work. Like I should have known. Then a 3 older guy comes around and says yes walmart is supposed take them so he doesn't know why the register wasn't accepting it. 😅  I emailed both walmart and the manufacturerabout the coupon before I even attempted to use it btw!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This was what I was thinking too. At least where I grew up, kids were heavily sheltered and actively discouraged to talk to anyone but family/friends. My friends and I literally weren’t allowed to go anywhere without an adult until our teens. Helicopter parenting made a lot of people less socially inclined and I don’t know why anyone’s surprised by that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think it really depends where you live, where I live a lot of genZ does communicate and doesn’t stare into space 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ok, tbh I don’t realize that I do this sometimes but it’s always because either my brain was focused on something else and now needs a minute to process or because someone just brought up a very sensitive topic that I absolutely do not want to continue…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as a millennial I find the whole accusation kind of fucky but tbh I don't even like making eye contact, let alone making small talk lol  since I have a few particular autistic traits, I am regularly accused of not paying attention in conversations when I very much am taking in everything--I just would rather not go mhmm yeah uh huh over and over, it feels rude to me or dismissive  but also neurotypical people really cannot deal with you not giving feedback   and when people say things like this about gen Z, it gives me that familiar feeling
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 24:33 in Italy evry person born after the 90s will NOT have retirement, so don't say that we are lazy and don't complain that the young people are leave the country  when the country dose absolutely nothing for us and expecting us to remain and respond to your stupid questione while I'm at work (payed 3€ at hours without contract or work security)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i’ll admit that when i stare at a person in silence im usually buffering because 1 i have no idea what someone just said and i need it to click in my head to understand what you said or 2 what you said doesn’t make sense to me so im loading a response that will maybe make you less likely to get mad at me :D
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The gen z stare is me fighting the urge to lash out at a customer when they’re doing stupid crap and not listening to/ reading instructions.  To be clear, I do try to be friendly towards customers but at a certain point my patience begins to waiver.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think the older generations want to be coddled and the younger generations just don't have the energy for that. Every day we are told how inferior we are and how the world is catching on fire figuratively and literally and how we can't afford anything. I'm sorry if I don't smile at you enough, I literally cannot care
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why are they calling the customer service stare the “Gen z” state   Literally the smile and wave tactic is used to be polite and act like we are listening to the customer cause we have too. Like I’m sorry I don’t care if you were to Egypt last week, this is a target but I’m paid to act like I care.  We are just trying to be polite but you are holding up the line.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In my experience/observation some ppl  of older gens forget that the oldest among us are closing in on turning 30 in a few years. We're not kids or teenagers anymore & not our entire generation does this 'gen Z stare' thing.   I'm from '98 & in my opinion very much on the cusp of Millennial/Zillennial/Gen Z. I have never just stared at a customer instead of saying hello etc unless they just asked me smth & my brain and mouth aren't working together properly.   I have noticed the Gen Z stare among my younger coworker who is maybe 16/17 rn. I'd say it's mostly the Gen Z'ers that are born in '06 or later.   As an older gen Z, I always greet our customers, say please and thank you and wish them a nice rest of their day.   That's common sense to me but hey it might not be to everyone I get that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i was just starting college when the worst of the pandemic and quarantining hit so by the time everything was opening up my second year i had to re-learn how to interact with and be around a large crowd of people again because i wasn't used to that anymore. i didn't realize how bad my social anxiety got from the pandemic until i was dropped in the deep end before i realized there was a pool in front of me. like i genuinely had to re-train myself to order from an actual person again if i wanted to eat from certain places since those places no longer had self-service computer things to order from
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not a single person has brought up Daria?  Really?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I live in ATL. It's real. I just don't care. They're miserable. I'm miserable. We're all miserable. I just move on and say nothing right back.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don’t think it’s true that Gen Z is being uniquely put down in a way that is harmful. Millennials were called entitled, lazy, and special snowflakes for a long time by older generations. They were known as the “participation trophy” generation also. I think the same problems that influenced Millennials were exacerbated for Gen Z or it’s just normal to think younger generations are lazy and entitled bc of typically better life conditions.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I work in the service industry as a server assistant, which basically means I run food, bus tables, and work takeout. The "gen z stare" is noticeable in more millennial and above. I'll walk up to a table with their food, say the name of the item, and wait for them to say "that's mine!". Sometimes, they will simply stare at me and say nothing, so I just set it down in a random spot and walk away. It's kinda annoying, but it isn't a difficult thing to deal with. I feel like people treat social awkwardness like it's the worst thing in the world, and this is something I feel isn't specific to our generation. Possibly more common, but I wouldn't pin it exactly as being the gen z stare, but moreso the stare or confusion one might have when their socially awkward. Weird to blow it up and make it a whole thing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My general philosophy is that consideration is owed until lost, respect has to be earned.   If someone comes at you with no consideration of yourself, then stare away baby, because they lost yours.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hi there, Gen X fairy gothmother here. I can tell you that every generation coming of age gets talked shit about amongst the older generations. I generally avoid such broad generalizations because I've been hearing the same bs for decades and I don't like it. Not to oversimplify, because y'all are coming into some rough times, but I think a lot of it comes down to gaining some experience, confidence and maturity that naturally comes with entering the world on your own. I was book smart but I was naive and didn't have a lot of common sense when I first entered the workforce, I can be very clear-eyed about the fact that I was a real dumbdumb back then hahaha.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: American culture has a large amount of enforcing correct facial expressions, with a uniquely huge emphasis on forcing people to smile. Adults have always harassed people for not smiling enough, autistic people. Strangers harassed me as a literal child over not smiling enough. Frankly I’m so happy that a large amount of gen z has normalized not forcing people to smile socially. Obviously this helps everyone, women have also been told to “smile more” a lot as well as other commonly infantilized minorities. However this is the exact same language used to criticize autistic people for not preforming in the way they should, and I’m so happy my generation isn’t ignoring how terrible and condescending it is. Not smiling isn’t failing at being social, most countries don’t smile as much as us. some people just feel entitled to force others to smile, and I do mean force.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i’m guilty of the gen z stare. i’ve worked at starbucks, and it’s not a “i don’t know how to talk to people stare” it’s a “i can’t believe you just said something that dumb in public with your full chest i am doing my best to not say something that will make me lose my job” stare
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 17:05 brother, i’m autistic and small talk is torture. I desPISE small talk. The social rule of “how are you” and not answering truthfully being expected is SO dumb. Why ask if you don’t actually want the truthful answer? It’s pointless. Just say “hi” at that point.  Allistics are confusing and being an autistic person in the workplace, masking is constant, and it’s draining and tiring I’m GONNA be wiped taking your order, sorry! not sorry. I don’t get paid enough to be anything more than base respectful. If you’re being dumb, my manager is three feet away. Imma hand you over to them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: LMAO same, its wild like my brain is fully cooked ma'am
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I like the word consideration, because that really doesn’t require the emotional labor that people seem to apply to being overtly friendly or polite.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am not Autistic; however, I have ADHD, CPTSD, and auditory processing issues. I one hundred percent agree with this. I don't know how to make facial expressions when it's a random customer or someone on the street. And when a customer asks me a question or is talking to me, I either sit there and ask "Huh? What?" a few times in a row, out of misunderstanding or not being able to process what they are saying (it sounds like mumbling), OR I sit for a second, process, then act. My hot take is that we don't need to fix ourselves (not including the people who ARE rude to customers without a valid reason), these people that have this idealistic expectation over us just need to work on their self-esteem. Because it is really THAT personal? You are most likely never going to see us again, if not once in a while.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think in the current day this is mostly seen as a misogyny thing, but I'm pretty sure it started in post slavery America so that Black people wouldn't be harassed (killed) by white people who had to tolerate sharing public space with them now. And just like tipping, it's a hold over from America's roots as the world's leading chattel slavers.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don’t expect people to smile, I just expect most to not be cold in their response.  I use to work at a gym and would get told to smile often but I always responded a little cheerfully saying that I was just really focused on what I was doing. People eventually realized I wasn’t rude just focused. Realistically, the job I was doing didnt really involve customer interaction generally, so there wasn’t really any need for these comments at all (which are rude regardless), but the difference is in the response mainly. I understand the stare thing has nuance. It’s not just the blank stare, it’s the “I’m annoyed you’re even asking me a question, go away, you’re annoying.” attitude.  Not all gen z is like this. I’d say most I’ve come across aren’t but when it does happen, it sucks. I actually prefer the old generations rudeness to gen z’s when they are rude.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ravenm6443  i think its just immaturity honestly. im curious what age group youre talking about? because im pretty sure teens in general have had that attitude since the beginning of time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also small talk doesn’t make me “feel better”, it feels like someone’s sawing at my brain tyvm.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: also also, side note, nobody owes anyone anything. That includes “if i’m having a hard time” etc etc. It DOES go both ways. People suck, fuck people. I don’t owe anyone anything and nobody else owes me anything. Bottom line
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: With the exception of the Tiktok-ification of interpersonal relations and information exchange, none of this -- and I mean NONE of this -- is new. Janeane Garofolo made this her personal brand decades ago, and the impersonal, blank judgment-y stare was a thing before that. People are just going online to get into their feelings about it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The types of people who are complaining are the same types I FULLY expect to give me a hard time at a service job for the SMALLEST of things.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I dont say hi when I answer the phone, I always wait for someone to talk first, especially with unknown numbers. Ive seen too many shows where saying shit on the phone can get people in trouble lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: they taught us "if u have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all", and then wonder why we're so quiet
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: we're not rude, you're just not used to being held accountable for your rudeness
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Working at a local cafe, I see all sorts of interactions. Yes, some older folks can be rude, but I've also experienced the silent treatment from my own Gen Z peers. I'm genuinely trying to be nice, asking simple questions, but sometimes I just get blank stares. Is it really that hard to just acknowledge someone when they're talking to you? I thought responding was basic politeness. Maybe that's just me lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sometimes when someone from an older generation explains something to me, I just nod along to understand and I wait for them to be done talking. But then they look worried at me and ask if I understood. Do they think I’m doing a gen z stare? Because I’m just processing everything really
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this ones weird. i didnt have zoom classes until my first year of college but its not like regular classes didnt have their fair share of disinterested students. i dont see how not responding in a zoom class taught people to just stare at people in real life when directly asked a question only they can answer (can i share your phone number? whats your order? etc.). i have mega anxiety and when im asked a question and im caught off guard or nervous to answer i dont just stare emotionlessly or rudely back. ill either scramble to find an answer so i dont make the other uncomfortable or give them a confused or surprised face showing that i literally just dont know what to say. if your response is to stare into their eyes until they say something else thats just rude and weird.  i also dont think the customer service stare is a result of bad social skills. as many of the people said, its a result of being financially trapped into a position where you have to deal w the braindead public all day. ive had that example w the gum happen to me before. ive had so many old people walk up and start whining off the bat about random shit that i cannot change and do not get paid enough to care about. ive had interactions where i say hello and the person who walked up to me instead of the self checkout doesnt respond and just looks at me rudely like i just spit on them. i normally do try to be friendly, but if you piss me off at my job then youve lost your politeness privilege. i dont think thats wrong and i dont think it has literally anything to do with my social skills.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I stopped saying "hello" when answering the phone because so many of the calls I get are those scam calls that record your voice. Once you say anything, it clicks and hangs up. That's not something to blame us for. Blame scammers. It's just our reaction to what may potentially be (and 9/10 is) a scammer.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 28.  I will stare at people under certain circumstances. they said something so wild I'm debating on if it's worth my breathe. Etc
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Shoutout to Squidward for being the first Gen Z character in media. Have you SEEN his dead inside, half-lidded stare?? Immaculate and definitely something wholly unique to our generation!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 14:10 That’s 100% poor communication + rude customer. Her handling of the situation was bad customer service, he was obnoxious, entitled, rude and unnecessary but, with all that same attitude she could have said, “we have a candy section right there, if we have gum it would most likely be there 🙄” same attitude less interaction time.   I’m all for matching energies, I’ve been bartending for 10 years 😅, but as a millennial, y’all can learn to be so much more efficient with your pettiness
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hit people with the stare whenever they're being bad customers. if you're getting the stare you're a bad customer 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I get it when people are being ignorant or dumb but when you say something nice or just simple small talk it’s just rude and you look stupid. I worked so many customer service jobs I get staring back because you can’t say what you really think
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im 19 and i feel like there are examples of both fr. like ive trained people at jobs who were around my age or a little younger and just felt like holy shit are you slow but i've thought the same about way more older people. i think most of it is the older people but i think that being completely inept socially is def prevalent with teenagers especially like current 14-15 year olds. you NEED at least social adequacy to function at a lot of jobs and in society in general
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Either these example tiktoks are making this whole thing up or this problem just doesn't where I live (Spain). Cause wdym the waiter says hello and asks if you want something to drink and you and your friends just... stare in silence?? Who does that?? Me and most of my friends are gen z and I don't think a single one of us would ever act that way. And we had actual lockdown here so I don't think you can pin this on covid tbh.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 🤔I think a lot of people miss the point by not thinking ahead enough. I’m a huge introvert, and I can happily spend a day working in silence, but it’s also really rewarding to build connections with people, even if it drains me more than it would an extrovert. I’ve worked retail, at a reception desk, and now I have a remote “back office” job, which I love. Even though it’s remote, I still maintain connections with people, it’s actually easier in some ways because you can have fun little chats, full of memes and inside jokes. Sometimes, calls that seem work-related turn into purely social moments.  What makes something potentially unbearable more bearable is the human element. I’ve had co-workers decades older than me who felt like a second mom. I’ve had a boss who was awful, but my colleagues and I shared those eyerolls in solidarity. Customers? Sure, some ask baffling questions, but it teaches you empathy and the ability to meet people where they are. If there's such a strong push to recognize how you are neurodivergent in certain ways, why don’t we extend that same recognition to others? Similarly, if people insist that everyone should work in retail or food service to understand where I’m coming from, why isn’t that same idea applied across the board?  It’s all connected to the whole “main character syndrome” thing. People often see themselves as “right” and “infallible,” which makes them hard to teach or correct. The classic customer service question about the gum is a good example: A customer asks for a product you don’t have, but you offer a similar one instead. It’s not rocket science, it’s a learned skill. The soft skills you develop in entry-level jobs help you in your career later on, too.  A lot of people complain about networking, saying it shouldn’t be necessary and that you should prove your worth through tangible accomplishments. But the reality is, if you don’t know how to “sell” yourself in a personable way, you’ll probably stall out at the starting point. I’m a massive introvert, but you still have to “play the game.” When you do, it pays off. I've gotten jobs not through intentional networking but simply by being good at my work. This applies to lower-level jobs too.  I’m 30, a millennial cusper, and it’s really not that hard to be kind and courteous. People notice that. We’ve all dealt with “difficult” customers and colleagues, so we know what kind of interactions we’d prefer. It’s just basic stuff, like the “Golden Rule”: do unto others as you’d have them do unto you. This is basic kindergarten-level wisdom.  For context, I’m not American, but I’ve been to the US, and it’s not that different from anywhere else. It’s not Mars 🤣
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: stuff like this is why i feel SO weird figuring out how to act around other people. i’ve become super overly enthusiastic to compensate for the part of me that just wants to disassociate so i have to hyper focus on being pleasant and bubbly. people think im weird for it but they think its weirder when im not overly happy and whatever. during the pandemic my anger issues reached an all time high and i had to take MANY steps back and change how i was acting. people have cut me off because of how un-drama focused i am now. i do not pick fights that aren’t mine anymore. slowly i’ve come to find out im not only not the only one who went through that but also not having a social life in the most formative years of my life changed the whole game for me and many others. i’m also fairly well versed in talking to people, my whole life almost everyone has told me i’m very mature for my age (now they don’t say that bc im an optimist and prefer to look at the good side of things). you just can’t win sometimes.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: God forbid i don't wanna interact with anyone more than i have to 🫩
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Right? This is just the rude stare that has existed since forever! I guess the difference is Gen Z thinks it is appropriate
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well that’s….hypocritical isn’t it? Extremely cop behavior.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @hello7032  If someone tells me "young lady you're awfully young to be pregnent" and i say "ma'am, i'm not pregnent i'm just chubby and wearing a hoodie" and they go whine to my manager that i talked back and how it was rude of me to say to them (calmly/deadpan might i add) that they are wrong and that they are NEVER wrong about these things, am i rude the one?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: depends on how you were raised 100%. i’m starting to feel like you can tell who’s parents actually interacted with them as children.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: seriously it's like basic etiquette is thrown out the window
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nah same idc what gen you from it’s weird to just blankly stare had older people do it and im just like ok rude then
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm okay with people not using a vocal response to acknowledge, but a nod or a shrug or even just a roll of the eye is appreciated
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: honestly i think it depends on the context? if you're chitchatting when they're actively doing something - especially preparing a drink - they might be tuning you out to try and focus on their task. but if it's downtime and nobody's doing anything then yeah, it is a bit weird to not at least nod along. although the kind of question can be part of it, too; i see a lot of older people keep "so what did you do this weekend?" in their back pocket, not realizing that most younger people's answer is either boring or personal and they're not gonna want to give more than a vague answer. or coworkers asking about stuff that is absolutely none of their business, like whether or not you have a boyfriend.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I understand, but i don't exactly control it, my brain just sometimes randomly focuses on something else, it takes like, 30 seconds or another noise for me to realize i should give an answer to whatever was said
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: okay, i’m glad i’m not tripping. it seems that basic compassion is slowly fazing out - makes me a bit sad. it starting to be a cyclical “we want connection, yet don’t extend the energy for what it takes to achieve it”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @digicode000  Each generation seem to be getting more and more unkind.  They get more involved in big social issues, but don't give a darn about people they see everyday.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For places like cafe, if people feel  unwelcome,  many stop coming in.  I'm not asking for a conversation, but if I ask a legitimate question, I would like an answer.  It can be a nod, a finger point, something besides just being stared at for 35 seconds or ignored all together.  Sometimes, I really would like to know where you hid the napkins or where the bathroom is.  An unresponsive, unhelpful staff does not make me want to spend money there. I don't need  you to be Pollyanna, I just need basic politeness and competence.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Maybe they just don't like you? I mean, we're only seeing your side of the story here. We don't know if you're confrontational, have talked badly about them behind their backs, or have done anything to make them dislike you.  I just stare at unpleasant or mean people. I don't think they're worth paying attention to because that's precisely what motivates them to be even worse.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It is, but politeness is a waste of everyone's time and energy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Smaestr and being rude and a asshole isn’t?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@Smaestrbrother, you can argue online but its a chore to say hello to someone? Chill tf out, what a bad attitude to exist with.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Lowkey this is ableist. I don’t think you MEAN to be ableist, it’s just ignorance but why is it rude for me to be looking at someone after they spoke to me? Why am I automatically staring rudely? Especially when I’m not expecting someone to speak to me it takes a while for me to process what they said and process my response. Maybe you don’t mind scrambling to not make the person uncomfortable, but it makes us BOTH uncomfortable for me to do that. Because I will stumble and trip over my words and people look at me like I’m a moron. And it sucks. And it makes me never want to go outside or speak to anyone. I can basically feel them calling me a slur. Let me take my time to speak you’re not gonna die waiting a few seconds for me to think. It’s not that deep.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 26 here. And I usually give the stare to problematic people at my job lmaooo or annoying regulars who ask the SAME questions each time they come in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: hi-chew isnt gum its soft candy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No. I’m gen z and went up to a gen z barista at Starbucks to order a few weeks ago. Didn’t greet me, didn’t ask what I wanted, just stared at me like an idiot until I broke the silence to say what I wanted when I realized she was indeed brain dead. Literally no interaction has happened yet and I got the stare… from my own generation. Some of you are just dumb and/or lack any customer service skills/politeness/manners/decency.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Avalon1316  I'm going to hold your hand when I say this but I don't think you knew she was waiting for you to say your order. Assuming this is a big chain restaurant, she probably had to deal with several other customers before getting to you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Avalon1316  I also want to add something I noticed about American culture in regards to the service industry. There's an prominent entitlement mentality when it comes to being owed pleasantries when they do not say good morning or thank you to the person behind the counter. As I am not American, it's such an oddity to me to see this happening when in my country you greet someone and say thank you regardless of who is behind the counter. I don't think less of anyone who doesn't engaging in pleasantries but I do question those who expect me to go the extra mile in terms of service when they haven't said so much as a hello to me. If you want kindness then give kindness. I'm sure if you said good morning, you're response would have been different
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Avalon1316 I mean, did you greet them? Greetings are kind of a two way street it sounds like you were both sort of staring at each other usually I say hi when I’m going to order something
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It sounds like yall are just bitching about someone having a neutral face while you’re talking🤷🏼‍♀️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's definitely played up for the camera. Notice how few of the people doing it are actually gen z
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's the customer service stare. My mom gave that stare back when she worked at customer service. And she's an elder millenial. It's simple, treat your service worker like trash and expect to get treated like trash back. It's simple cause and effect.   My whole every cashier's and service worker's face, old or young, was this. It's nothing personal they are just there for the paycheck. And anyway, if as the customer you were nice to the workers they would break into a little smile.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Here in in Brazil, the same applies here, i guess it's more of a north american thing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeah ive never seen anyone act like that lol. i live in the states. its a perception thing, not reality. i think people are going on what they think is happening versus what actually happened. chances are, the customer didnt hear them or was thinking or something. my most negative experiences in customer service have been with older people. the younger people are either neutral or friendly.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s an American issue with Gen Z! Seriously, all the social awkwardness, trouble with jobs, friendships, dating, etc… only in America you see this with Gen Z.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I agree 💯 with this comment. It's sort of funny because this generation talks a lot about empathy for others, but a basic way of demonstrating that is, surprisingly, the seemingly inconsequential act of a smile and small talk. When I was growing up, I didn't get it, either, but I have seen my mom defuse so many situations with a smile and a small but genuine exchange of words that eventually I had to respect the skill even if I couldn't fully imitate it myself.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well said, on point from an 80’s baby millennial, a lot of these skills actually help people socially too the soft skills. And crucial to dating & relationships. I think that’s why Gen Z is severely struggling in all three areas of their life, is because they aren’t gaining soft skills and just wanting some easy short cut, no hard work to do it themselves, and no creative problem solving.   The ones who do learn soft skills, they are THRIVING so much in life, seen it myself regarding the ones I’ve worked with. They have successful relationships, romantic & platonic, actually don’t struggle on the job, and are light years ahead of their peers you’d think they were born in the wrong generation 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When I was working in customer service, I never actually had a problem with the people asking stupid questions. In fact I was happy to answer them they weren't the problem and as far as I was aware the person asking me if we were selling pizza at pizza hut probably had a severe learning disability or something so it wouldn't be fair to judge them they were never a problem for me but on a daily basis almost, despite the fact that I was supposedly the ideal customer service rep always smiling, always giving compliments, always wishing the customer a nice day I would still be berated, S- ually harassed and on a few notable occasions, even physically assaulted and I was working in what was considered to be a very nice area full of decent people. So I can't blame anyone for not being all smiles and compliments when they're working in customer service for all. I know they were just that on the first day and over time after being exposed to the worst of humanity on a daily basis. They had that joy and love for the customer stripped away from them and probably just assume the worst of everyone and I can't blame them for it.  And I have a feeling that it's the Karen's making the TikToks about the Gen Z stare who are the ones who ruined those formerly enthusiastic and hard-working customer service reps for everyone by just being mean to them and treateding them like mindless robots who exist only to serve them instead of people in the first place.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My family hates talking so much we have learned sign language
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The owing people nothing trope really bothers the shit out of me. I recently ended a long time friendship after she and her husband came to visit, it was their first time spending any time with my fiancé, and she told me afterwards that she couldn’t be bothered to spend any time with my fiancé again because he talks too much. Girl so I’m just supposed to deal with all your relationship drama but I can’t even get a benefit of the doubt on my fiancé talking a lot because he was nervous because he knows my relationship with you is important to me? 😂 but no, me expecting that is now “transactional.” I’m so over my generation thinking we don’t even owe the people we care about patience, kindness, and grace. Inconvenience even your best friend to your own peril.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have social anxiety and I'm early Gen Z, but it doesn't stop me from exchanging pleasantries. I force myself to, it's necessary.   I hate small talk, but still partake here and there. The golden rule people.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just called this "staring at someone like they're stupid"   Because in customer service we aren't allowed to say whats on our minds we just gotta stare at someone saying the stupidest shit. We are absolutely baffled and perplexed someone that stupid would be so confident about it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a younger milennial and I've caught myself multiple times doing that to anyone who mildly annoys me or just talk too much
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 3:40 ah thanks teammanager lady, so the gen z stare is the one you get when you take longer distracting people by trying to talk them into doing your job than it would've taken you to do your job and just compile a contacts list for the project as one usually does...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 22:50 As a Millennial, I promise you that vilifying the youngest generation is something that happens to every generation. Idk why, but older generations always have a ton of shit to say about the “youth”. So when you point out the gen z is being labelled as lazy and problematic, just know it happened to us millennials too. In the worst way, it’s almost like a ‘right of passage’ situation. The cute things the gen z label millennials as now are not the things we were labelled as when we were younger. I know that doesn’t make it feel any better, but just know that there isn’t anything specific about gen z that are making people label y’all lazy etc, it happens to all of us. Would love to change that, but until then just try not to take it to heart ❤️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: One thing I'd like to add, I remember growing up everyone on tv and in person talking about how much they hate small talk. And how annoying and draining it is. And now gen z is grown up and the same people ask "where's my small talk at?" all they did on talk shows is complain about that and air plane seatings
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: probs both. both gens lack social skills. the pandemic affected everyone. individualism is also at all time high, empathy and listening isn't promoted. besides, if the lack of social skills r so extreme, why make fun of that? isn't that ableist.....? oh well.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hate that they used that clip of the guy just doing his job as "the gen z stare". Bro looked tired like he'd been working all day and is at least attentive and responsive. Sometimes this whole thing is super way blown out of proportion. However, not responding at all is kinda.. weird
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think a huge part of why my generation misses the point of what is being said by older generations is bc, they are talking to us like we are dumb children who understand literally nothing. The example of the lady at 18:06 is a good example of this. Why would I want to listen to u when u are blatantly speaking in a mocking baby voice??? If you want to get your points across, get them across like an adult and explain them in a way that isn't there to harass and humiliate, explain it like an adult or shut the hell up.   And im not saying this bc I can't answer a phone or whatever, I have good customer service, customers like me and frequently tell my managers as much. I just think making fun of people who struggle with mental disabilities due to issues in social development is insane.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like the Gen Z stare is a combination of social anxiety and annoyance.  1. Some of our most important social years were spent inside because of a virus. 2. Sometimes you need a moment to really process the dumb thing someone said so you don't just respond with, "Are you an idiot?"  At the place I work at we recently had someone come in to ask for a credit for a food item they didn't pay for. I'm not sure how exactly it is a difficult concept that you aren't going to get a credit to compensate you for something you weren't missing. In that moment I struggled to find a customer friendly way of telling them we can't do that, in response they scoffed at me and walked out angry as if I was the one who did something wrong.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: To me it’s always so rich when older generations talk about what skills the younger generations are lacking. Um EXCUSE ME? WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO TEACH THEM THOSE SKILLS? YOU!! YOU WERE!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I work in the food serve industry and I can tell you it’s not GENz who does the stare, it’s the older people (40 above). They’re always rude and ask the dumbest of questions. They leave the tables and floors a mess. They talk loudly and never push in chairs. They ask for a server or waiter 30 times for things they can’t control. They ask for things that aren’t on menus, or that I truly have never heard of. They’d ask if we have another restaurants brand sauce.  And I’d just like to add that i can almost 99.999% say in confidence that THIS 5:39 has never happened or at least not to her. Most people who complain about the GENz stare are people who never actually experienced it but think it’s fun picking on a younger generation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Is Gen Z Socially Awkward, or are you just annoying?   Honestly, it could be both tbh. A lot of people in my generation are VERY socially awkward, introverted, and just less talkable than other generations, mostly attributed after COVID (I would know, my social skills have gone off a damn cliff since the Pandemic lmao 😭😭😭)   That said, most people in Gen X, Boomers, and Especially Millenials can be completely rude and mean spirited to Gen Z for no real reason.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yesterday, I was on the bus, going home from my psychiatrist visit, and this old lady with bags of groceries sat down next to me. She suddenly turned to me and started talking, about how sad she is, how sad the "world today" is, how many kids and grandkids she has, but her daughter in law wont let her see them, etc etc, and I was just like.. Lady.. I just bawled my fricking eyes out after an emotional breakdown from talking and thinking about my own shii. I understand that everyone has it different and difficult etc, but I did NOT need to nor want to hear her pour her head out on me.  She kept asking me something once in a while, so I just smiled and nodded and said a couple words, but I was just so damn tired.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: honestly I didn't know this was a Gen z thing and I thought there was something wrong with me specifically...it kinda makes me feel better it's not just me who's experiencing this after graduating college and being employed at 25
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think part of the problem too is that people let them just stare. Like if you’re a waiter and someone is just staring at you when you ask them a question, just keep looking at them back until someone answers. Don’t let them off the hook by answering the questions for them. If we don’t require them to step up and communicate we are letting them feel that the communication is optional in the workplace.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly for me, it’s not really about owing someone it’s more about my social battery is just low. I’m introverted. I have school work and a decent amount of friends so before anybody says something about community I got mine OK. Sometimes you’re just exhausted from dealing with people and don’t want to have another small talk throughout the day and that’s OK. I think we also have to realize that not everybody we’re talking to is in a great mood and people should be able to have the option of not always making small talk.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Aww that’s cute he talked too much tbh. My friends man is like that too but I still hang out with him in groups, I just have to request 1:1 time with my friend and it’s all good
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @judysm95 exactly! That is a perfectly normal response.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: you're being rude. why take such a problem with it? just chill out. i know we grew up watching everything go to shit and how powerful people dgaf about anything other than money, but not every figure of power is an absolute jackass. she was attempting communication and there are differences between that and whatever else you thought she was doing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Agree. We need to do better as millennials though now. (Not you personally) but we should stand against the hurtful stereotypes. ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it definitely has some ableism inside, subconsciously most likely.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: honestly I see it as a mix of being genuinely dead inside because of stress and just life, and being so exhausted with these living relics who can't connect to wifi talking to us like we're toddlers being spoon fed baby food, I mean c'mon grandmpa, I am infinitely more capable in the modern world than you, you just have money to throw at people to fix your problems
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am an elder millennial, so hear me when I say… autism, depression, bipolar, generalized anxiety is not new. You can only control what you can control. But the turnover when hiring the under 30s should be studied. Many youngers, lack so many  workable verbal and social skills, seemingly because they haven’t been exercised as much. These things are muscles that we had to grow as well! Good luck out there
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jasminewilliams1673 are those turnovers employees being fired or quitting? because that matters. Gen z typically dont stay at jobs long especially if we are not promised growth and opportunity.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Completely agree! Also I would say it’s mainly boomers lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Lol fr. Just thought I was stupid, but really we just weren’t socially nurtured because of social media, helicopter parenting or complete opposite (no parenting), video games and digital media overall.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: something something avocado toast. It's embarrassing for millennials to carry on the generation war when we got dogpiled on for literally everything we did or didn't do
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Milennials are now the GenX complaining about the youth. And the expectation for so forced and fake customer service is so uniquely an american issue. We love to be treated so well wherever.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Remember, these are the same people who voted for a felon in office complaining about the fact that a service worker looked at them the wrong way 💀💀 they demand respect, but don’t give any then wonder why we’re fed up… we were promised so many things as adults just for older generations to completely destroy the economy by the time we got there. We’re fed up. We’re poor. We work three jobs and are still called lazy. The older generations just need to admit that they want a punching bag to make them feel good about how they were treated as the “newer generation” and move on
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the so-called "gen z stare" had been a thing for generations. I've seen a couple of stares like that from ppl older than me who are tired, uninterested, bored, weirded out, or simply not in the mood.  attitude transcends generations and i dunno why the old gen actin like they aren't like that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Tbh I’m a younger millennial (1994) and i genuinely feel bad for gen Z.  The world is broken and they have no illusion about it, yet told to smile and get to work. Our generation had the last bit of hope that things would work out if we “tried”, and the luckiest of us got our footing before Covid hit. But Gen Z doesn’t have hope because they know the system is rigged yet they’re supposed to follow the same social script. It must have been so disorienting to come into adulthood right now.    A small retail example: I was at Whole Foods doing self check out. A Gen Z cashier was standing in the area but looking off into the distance, clearly a lot on his mind, looked very unhappy. I didn’t engage. A random older Gen-Xer was was like “cheer up, it gets better” which is just super petty and unnecessary.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I never hear anyone say anything bad about gen z in real life. But every time I go online I hear about gen z saying that they're mad and tired 😂 I think the most scathing thing I've said about gen z with friends is that they're boring
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don’t like running my mouth talking to just anyone
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Gen Z living in Europa, as I speak of my experience, my bosses know that I take longer to express myself; therefore, I stare before answering. They sometimes say my stare is concerning and scary, but they understand that I'm socially anxious and all that. Some of the older generation are just too sensitive and self-centered.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z isn't pretending everything is okay like older generations did
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Emtpy small talk really isn't important. In many societies you don't really do this. I have never participated in small talk, nor have I ever really experienced someone else participating in small talk. And society is perfectly fine. People still talk with other, but when they do there is a point and it's actually a productive conversation and when someone doesn't want to talk with you, you just don't talk with them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not to be creepy but you have beautiful teeth and a beautiful smile
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The only people I've seen with the Gen z stare are stoners like myself 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 14:21 and Hi Chew ain't even gum!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why is it so bad I don’t want to talk to random people I don’t like dog. Especially if I’m not at work
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In a way, I see this as a confidence/social prompting issue. I don’t think this issue is uncommon whatsoever…for 10 year olds. But I do think gen z is “behind” on the situational navigation front. Not maliciously though. I do think that gen z is exactly where they should be as far as considering everyone other than themselves stupid- very common at that age and every generation has probably thought the same thing. So…that’s a maturity issue. Nothing too crazy here. I think gen z will grow out of some issues, and change the world to accommodate other issues.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I had a customer yell at me for scanning his items i ended up shutting down so i didn’t snap or burst out crying, i talk and greet people because that’s technically part of my job, phone calls are still my weak point calling people stresses me out and i am working on it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a younger gen z ive sincerely never experienced the gen z stare irl. Ive certainly never done it to someone myself because that would make me incredibly embarrassed, but ive also never seen my peers do it. Ive had to work on my social skills tremendously due to mh but even at my most socially anxious i would not have ever just stared at someone when asked a question or talked to. Acknowledging the other human is a bare minimum.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: generation wars are about the dumbest shit ever we need each other to function as a species
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My boss yelled at me over an issue that was relatively unimportant. I knew that if I talked back to her she would try and get me fired. She has the absolute worst attitude so the yelling thing was expected but also just ridiculous. I'm not getting fired cause she can't manage herself, so I just stared at her. She then yelled at me to "Stop looking looking at her like she's crazy" as if she wasn't just yelling at me for nothing. I don't even work in customer service. Smh.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Gen Z person I feel like the videos where they show someone doing a pause and a side eye or hesitating cause they are following someone’s train of thought but don’t see the point, is what the Genz Z stare is. Like a refusal to speak cause something seems either obvious or the person they are interacting with sounds dumb.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Eh, its been mutual. Remember last year the millenial cringe tiktoks that went viral? Remember Gen Z was making fun of millennials for their DIY hipster style during the Great Recession? Its not something that should even be taken more seriously than it is.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @venusluv-i1v you sound just as childish as the ppl on TikTok
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@venusluv-i1v  those tiktoks were meant as silly jokes, no one was taking them seriously. hell, even millennials themselves were digging up old stuff and making fun of themselves in those times.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh boo hoo. The world changed when the Cold War ended. Quit crying just because you are the same part of history as everyone else.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i honestly don't know. i honestly just want to be left alone
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Never heard of this term and I've had this done to me more by old people. They keep making up new terms for stuff that people have already been doing, just so they can "shame" others
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this whole conversation is so abstract to me bc im from a slavic country and we just dont really do small talk pretty much at all not the older generations or the younger generations
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 24:42 I feel like we’ll be 35+ when things look up. And then they’ll ask us why we didn’t work harder
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as someone who used to work at starbucks, i started loving small talk sometimes. like yes please tell me random stuff while im halfway listening and swamped w/ a lot of drinks☺️☺️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: my version of the “gen z stare”, is me trying reallyyyyy hard to find the kindest words i could possibly ever say to ppl who are genuinely stupid, lack common sense/decency n are disrespectful. n if everyone took a sec to try really hard to find those three things as much as i try to find the kindness, deep in my already withering soul from working customer service, i feel the gen z stare would dissipate 😀 it’s also just to let ppl know i see them so if they need anything then they know, ik they’re there. but i’ve always worked fast paced jobs n i learned quickly that stopping to greet customers n ask them if they need anything, wastes time. cuz 9x/10, just cuz they’re near you, doesn’t mean they need anything or even wanna communicate n stopping what i’m doing every 3 secs is so inconvenient. n that’s why customers needa learn to speak up when they actually do need something cuz we got things to do babe 😭🤚🏻 but it’s like as soon as ppl walk into any establishment, all common sense/decency leaves their fuckin heads i don’t understand it lmaoooo
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It can also happen where it’s the workers you do the stare at cause imagine you’re at mcdonalds with a free fries coupon, you tell the worker to scan it, he says pull aside to claim them but for now pay 6$, so you explain over and over again that free means you don’t pay, you end up paying that 6$ and after 20 minutes of all this shit, finally the worker understands and says “oops, well here’s more fries” so now you wasted 6$ and got a shit ton of fries for nothing, istg some people are just so stupid🤦‍♀️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Okay in my defense, I don't say hi immediately when someone calls me is because I heard spam calls will mark you as an active phone number if you respond.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It happen to me a couple of months ago, I was at work and my job is very fisical, you have to push equipment around and built stuff with the equipment, so, I was moving somthing and this dude comes from behind and pushes the box without any interactions, I didn’t asked for help, he just pushed me aside and made me trip, I said "Hey, just chilled for a second, I got this" and he stared at me for a really long time, so I asked "What is wrong, like, I just said "calm down" He keeped staring, no words, no nothing, just looking at me with disgusted, so I asked "why are you looking at me like that?" He stared for a while and said "you are making me uncomfortable" and I'm there thinking "What?" What part of please chill, you are pushing people and making them trip is making you uncomfortable? That's a basic interaction with coworkers, you are not working alone, there's other people around and you are a hazard for others if you are not respectful of other people's spaces, like, you literally made me trip, we are all very committed to safety, team leads are alway telling us to be carful and respectful for others because thats how accidents happen. You are not alone in the world; deal with it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Mostly I stare at mostly older people when they say something stupid or rude. The other times it’s me processing what they said before responding. I guess you could call it “buffering” mentally
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m so glad my job was too scared to tell me off for being not perfectly polite to rude customers (the entire establishment would collapse without me). I’m not even joking I left for uni then:  they failed 5 health inspections, I was the only one that told people to wash things properly.   Three managers quit, I did most dropped shifts and was the only non manager that could handle all the managers duties (we were supposed to have two managers every night, I could handle the work of a manager)   They couldn’t train anyone, I was responsible for all new employees (once again, only one who could pass an inspection)  I knew how to do EVERYTHING EVEN THE THINGS I WASNT EVEN SHOWN ON THE COMPUTER (I had been doing back of house stuff for TWO YEARS before getting the computer training)  Now they’re completely shut down. Whole building is fenced off   So they did turn a blind eye when i yelled back at a customer (I never raised my voice unless they had first)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm still getting pissed off at "the customer is always right" arguments, not even 3 months into a retail job and I'm asked where something I didn't know we carried is. Never seen anyone buy it, never had to restock it, never showed it during orientation. I naturally tell him I don't know but someone at the registers might, he calls me a f"ucking dumbass" and "worthless,"  direct quotes. But apparently I deserve it according to some older generations
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think overall the customer service issues we are experiencing right now stem from ingrained management issues. Most management is not actually willing to train people for good customer service anymore, they expect it to be some sort of universal knowledge that everyone should just come into the workforce already possessing, But it is a learned skill that needs to be taught. I believe our society has become hoarders of skills and knowledge, instead of sharers that pass things on.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 12:38.  God, I'm a server in a older community spot and GOD- YEP. Because if I said my actual thoughts you would either go to my manager and make my day worse, make me lose my job, or leave. ALL OF WHICH ARE BAD FOR ME.  But UNFORTUNATELY  I have a bad poker face, so I have to focus on not grimacing or scrunching up my face. And thinking about how I'm going to form a nice sentence after you passive aggressively insult me, or my workplace, or my skills, or my appearance, or my word choice, OR LITERALLY ANYTHING THAT IS LIKELY OUT OF MY CONTROL AND CANT FIX FOR YOU.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Things I think are contributing to the Gen Z Stare: 1) mental health and disability awareness has made us more comfortable with not requiring constant eye contact to maintain a conversation 2) The Office. We're all looking to camera
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My side of the Gen Z stare is due to just hating small talk in general like telling you how my day has been, what did i do over the weekend? I don't even stare I just end the conversation in one word answers and get back to what I was doing. Because the answer is 99.99% of the time it was fine and nothing much just chilling at home. Like if we want to break the ice we would benefit from a more hypotethical deep conversation like do you think we are the only ones out there in the universe (aliens or something else)? Or what would you actually do in the trolley problem if it was real life? That's the kind of stuff that interests me, but I know most people aren't comfortable with those kind of things. Asking how your day has been is just draining hearing it day after day after day imo and what i did over the weekend just feels bad sometimes like in reality im doing nothing when I probably could have been doing something interesting, but I like to destress and relax. If I wanted to tell you how im feeling or what I did that was cool over the weekend I would just tell you and bring it up in normal conversation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i like your point about how much of the loneliness epidemic comes from people not being willing to put in the work socially, i’ve been trying to make a habit of saying “have a good one/day” when people get off the elevator in my dorm building and even small things like that work as a nice easy start (easy cause they’re leaving so if it’s awkward it’s fine). since i’ve started doing it i’ve heard so many people do the same, and i don’t think i started this by any means but it feels nice! it’s just a little short sweet pleasant exchange :) i feel like it’s helping build my ability to talk to people
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I literally had a stare I couldn't stop when my dad was laying into me because I've been struggling with university. I'm supposed to be the smart one.  And they called me a waste of money, and then said I have a edgy teenager's stare.  No dad, I'm just dissociating because you've traumatised me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: also lowkey the autistic struggle. the amount of times i got insulted, berated, otherwise discriminated, just for having a face and not pulling some grimace with it 24/7.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a genZ myself (born 2002), i have never seen the stare irl.  But maybe that's because I'm german and we are known to stare. We're also not that prone to smalltalk, at least in ages under 50. Older people are more likely to just talk to strangers, either just for communication to pass time or for validation because they are mad at something else. I mostly just give one sentence answers and smile. Smalltalk with strangers just feels weird to me but i guess that's because i was told "don't talk to strangers" once too many times as a kid, and it stuck.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Omg I thought this said "Gen Z Isn't Socially Awkward, They're Just Annoying" And that made so much sense to me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: that is soo weird - I do not work with people so I did not realize they are so weird, but from the examples the communication is out there to make sure all of you are on teh same page, when you are staring silently - you are not giving any sign that you heard, you understood, you are there. Gen Z - you is basic stuff people, you at minimum should signal you are seeing and hearing others.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In all of the jobs I’ve had, I’ve definitely only seen a stare or a general vibe of “I don’t want to be here and why are you here” from much older people. My coworkers my age were kind and maybe a little awkward, but social.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m gen z and I’m so good at communicating that they took away my barley
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have a lot of beef with the concept of not owing people anything and you expressed it well. I do owe people, and vice versa. I want to live in a society where I can expect some basic kindness and care, and I want to give it in turn. Sometimes it's important to be honest over being polite, but goddamn people need to have some patience. I got an IT job and so many times I've been in calls with people that ask "stupid" questions and like, it's stressful when people don't understand you, but idk the extremely young tech with weird nuanced issues is hard to interact with. Sometimes you mishear someone. I would much rather deal with a stupid question than an idiot too confident to even ask. And I want to be understood when I make mistakes, so I give the same in turn.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the thing is that most of these people in the videos saying “this is the gen z stare” (especially that server one good lord) are giving BIASED accounts so obviously it’s going to look disjointed. and if people would remember we were stuck in our houses for two years then yeah the social skills are absolutely going to be stunted.  at the same time, being expected to be social 24/7, is stupid. having manners doesn’t equal wearing a jolly smile everywhere. elderly people are so disconnected themselves that they don’t understand that some people are just simply awkward and not comfortable with speaking to strangers which is okay! empathy across all generations is dying. they need to stop shoveling all the blame on us for real😭😭😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Social interactions make me feel crazy, and they always have. Someone (almost always older than me) will be like, "Hi, how are you?", And I respond, "I'm fine, how about you?"  And the other person will look at me like I just said I wanted to eat their face or something.   Or, I'll misspeak, like accidentally say that it's Tuesday when it's Wednesday or something, and the other person seems to get genuinely angry as I try to correct myself.   I've never subscribed to the "nobody owes anyone anything" stuff. I've always believed we owe each other basic kindness. I try my best to be kind and people still react like I'm trying to bite them. Even coversations about the weather or something.   I'll say,  like, "It sure has rained a lot today, hasn't it?"  And the other person just gets this look on their face like I've said something really weird and inappropriate to them. They look around like they're checking if anyone else can see me and they'll be like, "Oh. Um. Rain, yeah." Or even slink away without saying anything.   I can't figure out why. It makes me not want to engage with people because it's a total dice roll how they're going to react, no matter what I say.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Gen Z, I know I do the stare, one because I'm judging someone, but also because I find it takes way too much energy to make my face look anything but blank and I need that shit to get through the day, to do basic things like eat and take care of myself. Also, I hate small talk, and I think a lot of us do, because why the fuck do I care about the weather? Small talk is chatting about useless information that most people lie about anyway: "How was your day?" "Oh, it was okay." Most of the time, people do it to fill the silence, and there is really no need for that. It's not about communicating online either, I personally hate texting and calling people and would rather talk in person, it's hard to get emotions through the screen and I find i end up being a jerk without meaning to, so I just prefer to talk face to face. I think that you are also told to smile and say hello to customers, or you will get reprimanded. That has been my experience in these sorts of jobs: you get shit for not doing it. Sorry about the bad grammar.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ive remembered a quote: community it inconvenient 😂, you have to go out of your way to help build a community
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I had this as someone who had to handle interns. Oh my dear lord. they stare like they are internalizing something but not really listening to you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What I hate the most is when a customer will come up to the counter and before i even talk “hey how you doing? Can I get a-“ without any room for me to do that greeting. And then I’ll hear those same customers complain that we don’t greet them. As if they even give me time to
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Some of the big reasons we dont participate in small talk in the workplace is 1: a good majority of us do not live to work, we work to live, we do the job, get the money, then go do the hobby at home we enjoy whether for personal pleasures or the hope it might become something a little more. 2: We do not find small talk engaging, if there is no purpose for us to be talking or an icebreaker/opening statement isn't in the conversation, then its just a conversation to kill time and when you are working or communiting, its better all around to be more focused on the work or the next stop on the bus than a conversation that didnt need to happen
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The "gen z stare" has always existed and it's just the expression you do when you just want to go on with your day and mind your business but people don't let you do it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Older gen Z here. I was in college during the pandemic and my brother was in 8th grade. We both turned out alright because we found community. We both do volunteer theater and having that experience is so helpful. The gen Z stare was real before the pandemic. I was raised on “if you have nothing nice to say, don’t say anything at all.”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im 36 and even i do the "gen z stare" when someone says something completely and utterly stupid  like sorry i'm not going to coddle your smooth koala brain, i don't care who you are
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i work in a clearance charity shop, which means think of normal charity shop prices then half it. we get old stock and we sell most things for £1-£3. i'm gen Z and i do the "gen z stare"  but only EVER at older people that say the most outrageous stupid shit to my face. and it's always about our prices.  all the fellow gen z that come in are so nice, it's always the older people asking for discounts on items that are already £3, I'VE BEEN CALLED A CRAZY WOMAN FOR NOT REDUCING A PAIR OF £15 JEANS THAT WERE £70 NEW, they are just SO rude to me and the volunteers (which are all either teenagers or elderly people). the gen z stare is genuinely reserved for rude entitled older people that walk in and think our prices aren't low enough when we are the cheapest store in our whole area. it makes sense that the people making fun of gen z for the "stare" seem really annoying to deal with if they were a customer.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: from my experience, ive literally seen only old ppl stare at me. beside, i get why gen z ppl who work for minimum wage dont want to have small talk with random other workers that they dont know
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m Gen z and I’ve definitely done this to people. I work as a cashier and most of the customers (esp regulars) are at least 50, usually 60-70. And most of them are chill and I’m happy to stand and have a convo with them. I even know a couple by name because I actually want to hold a convo with them.  However, a lot of them are really judgy or entitled. They give me dirty looks because I sit in my rollator at the register. I’ve had multiple of them try to tell me I’m not in pain because I’m too young for that, or get the “you must be so lazy” looks. Those are the people who get that stare. The stare also usually comes with a monotone voice and very forced smile. Some of them get the hint and leave quickly and some of them don’t. I’m never directly rude, I don’t just ignore people if I can help it. But I definitely do this to some people.   I also just struggle with facial expressions and I wear a mask at work because when I get sick I often lose my already limited ability to walk and I live in a house with a billion stairs. So I definitely come off as more flat than I actually feel or am. There’s a couple regulars who choose my register over other open ones, even if I’m helping someone else already. It’s just the already kind of nasty customers that get this treatment.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Deadass the other day when I was on the register ringing this lady out at Michaels she looked me in the eyes and told me "Its saying to take my card out"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 13:41 I work in retail and oh my GOD the amount of older people who just walk up to you and say the name of a product as if that’s a proper way to ask about something.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im a Zillenial, i think its moreso that gen z are given ample response time in their usual communication modes, so theres a lag in the in person expectation of conversation.  You can edit a text or dm how you want to exactly articulate your point. You can rerecord a tiktok or voice note, but in person conversation is different. Plus gen z grew up when the cancel culture debate was HUGE so there may be an added pressure of getting their words correct.  Also, the gen population has always been dumb, i think gen z just lack the awareness of body language cues theyre giving off.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: but also i'm schizoid and i don't even want to be there 99.99% of the time
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m in college rn and almost every day someone makes some sort of small talk with me.  And my social skills generally are really good.   But I also feel so uncomfortable talking to people   So I’m just there talking looking perfectly fine but inside I’m yelling at my self to end the conversation but I keep talking because I don’t want to be rude so I talk till the conversation ends naturally
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wait, older gens are so inept at non-verbal gestures that they need to be fed constant input verbal? Like some real life NPC character??
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The only time I ever used the “gen z stare” as a gen z was whenever someone spoke to me in a foreign language during my internship because I am genuinely trying to come up with a way to respond properly in a way that they understand lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im autistic plus some childhood trauma, but also my struggle to understand social cues and all that made me be maken fun of, shamed, and generally me not understanding when what i call friends cross my boundaries  it also can take a while for me to process and prepare for conversations, so esp if its a random stranger coming to talk to me ill just be fully silent cause i want to be left alone
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 0:43 never seen one of your vids but ur doing something right bc I immediately smiled and got excited when you showed up
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was watching your video this morning outta curiosity. My boyfriend comes in with the "thats ai. Thats an ai voice" and im just confused like?? "No? Its not?" Showed him a bit of the video and he says  "Oh. His voice is so crisp and clean i thought it was ai." So, they unintentionally complimented you?? 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, that’s just not always the case. The other day I told a worker at a gas station that the soup dispenser was empty…. And I got the stare. So sorry doing your job it annoying. 🤦🏽‍♂️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i do walk into a food establishment and expect a greeting, i don’t wanna interrupt their job or them feel like im trying to be pushy but if they never greet me after 5+ minutes i just get more and more anxious, then they’re like “uhhh are u here for a pickup order” like what do u think im standing here for😭 it’s also part of most food service jobs to greet the customer
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: A lot of times I’ve zoned out so if I’m staring then a quick movement would literally bring me back to reality 😭😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 14:35 the old man was looking for a way to freshen his breath and looking for a small convo with another human being. I feel like the thing gen z has gone through didn’t do much to them in the regards of social interaction due to the internet. It just changed the platform on which they speak. They’re more comfortable speaking online and through internet memes. They’re the first fully online kids
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im an older fen z but when i worked customer service i always hit em with a “🤨” and they seemed to get it. Just hit the dreamworks eyebrow and the point gets across
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I sometimes rewatch this video to remind myself that i need to be nice. I'm glad you made this!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My first and only job that I’ve had was a “personal shopper” (basically I got people’s online orders and packed them and then brought it to their car). I once had an older man tell me “you look just like my wife when I first met her. Your body and everything”. What am I supposed to say to that. I just kinda laughed and said “oh cool”. He would always give us tips so it was really awkward to be told this and then handed 10 dollars. As soon as the summer ended I went back to my normal schedule and didn’t end up seeing him again (he only ordered one day in the week). He ASKED ABOUT ME to my coworkers. I only brought his order out for the SUMMER and he asked where I was. He stopped shopping at our store after he was told I don’t work that schedule anymore. He had been shopping with us for 2 years and left because I wasn’t the one bringing his order out anymore. There were so many insane interactions I was forced to have and I was getting paid the bare minimum for the hardest job at the store. I was as kind as I could be to people but if I didn’t say hi immediately to some people they would get upset (even if they never said it first).   Moral of the story is there are so many reasons to not talk to older generations and they hold a grudge the one time you aren’t as friendly
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I really like how you not only take accountability in place of each generation while also explaining pretty perfectly how each generation can’t have an expectation while also demanding a direct contradiction to said expectation.   I’ve never experienced the “Gen Z stare” myself, and I’m a millennial who was also very much socially impacted by the whole pandemic negatively effecting my level of socialization to an otherwise “comfortable” level
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I love how the older generation is fitting the stereotype of being absolutely shocked that the way they treated their kids DID affect how their kids developed 😂😂😂 somehow we are just like this. But allowing a generation to become addicted to technology is definitely not the cause 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I find it so funny because the “gen-z stare” is also just another way to describe the rbf that results from completely relaxing all of your facial muscles and not holding tension in them. It’s almost like someone working customer service would do better to try to keep that neutral facial expression so it’s less likely for them to lose control of it when someone says something infuriating or treats them like they’re stupid
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I work at a retail store, and I had a customer the other day who cut the entire que line of people and literally beginning to throw her stuff on my counter. When I informed her that she would have to get in line she proceeded to look at the people behind her, staring at her like she was an idiot, and then turned back to me to say "there's nobody there.", as if to try and gaslight me into ignoring my own eyes, and when I affirmed that she would have to get in line she went "well I'm just gonna leave then". She proceeded to slowly walk out, abandoning her cart in front of my register, starring at me over her shoulder as if expecting me to chase her down to plead that she spends the $30 she might have spent on her sh*t. I stared back at her like she was a dumb@$$ of course before proceeding to ignore her as she stormed out like a toddler. Some people just want your time, energy, and soul, and the best thing to do is just to treat them like the spoilt brats they are, because it pisses them off so bad and shows everyone else's just who they are too.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a Gen Z I have used the “gen z stare” because someone asked if we sell clothes for men (we were standing in the men’s department)  and I just had to stop and really question why they would ask that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think the gen z stare is an apt and appropriate response to other people's stupidity. Like someone else has said something so ridiculous, and staring at them and waiting for them to figure it out is better than telling them outright that they're being ridiculous.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a millennial and I do those stares when I'm dealing with stupidity and/or arrogance. 😒😮‍💨 This ridiculous topic just has me sighing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im a cashier and i have this one regular who doesn't have a wallet so he folds his cards in a wad of cash. One day I told him he outta get a wallet as a joke and he said it's a scam because jeans now a days don't even have pockets... like hello?? Where ru getting ur jeans. Also had  another lady tell me abt her C section in great detail and a man tell me about how he was on his way to see his mistress.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen z here, I have never- not even once- gotten "The Gen Z Stare", the opposite actually. More often than not I'll get the normal small talk or exchanged nod/smile (meaning the basics, normally with a short compliment to them like "I love your earrings!" If they seem like they had a long day)   Though of course this might just be my small town/village mindset, but this is how it works for me in cities too so idk
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a millennial, socially awkward one, always have been, but I never got validation for such (which was just an opposite extreme) and had to learn how to work with my own anxiety, had to go to therapy later in life, had to take responsibility for my own behaviour not only in social awkwardness but in general and learn how to navigate world if I wanted to live in it…many things in my 20s I found ridiculous and felt as shouldn’t be or were set up wrongly by older generations as well and I am very pleased to see how much is at least in mental health department improving…but lately hearing gen z speaking about issues, seeing the behaviours as much I understand where they might be coming from and absolutely have a compassion to validate the struggle I see a lot of entitlement…I am not really talking about this particular video.  there is always a middle ground in everything and where it once was capability to stand up for oneself ask for what one deserves due to the effort and time they put in, not being taken for granted is somehow changing into absolute entitlement in some cases and that is not a positive change…I am glad to hear for once a creator taking some sort of accountability and responsibility as many gen z (maybe I am just unlucky) I see lately just don’t and everything is someone else’s fault, everyone is being annoying even if they’re not and there is almost no compassion towards anyone older then them…its part of being young to some degree I had to go through life experiences myself to understand and build level of compassion but dam im glad our level of entitlement never reached what is going on now. But im definitely with you on gen x and boomers too 😅  I worked in customer service so I absolutely get it and not one customer received a stare from me because sometimes OMg the questioners, the small talk 8-10 hours a day over and over the same or ridiculness of the questions (coming from as well gen z btw 😅) is just too much and it’s just too draining and I way too often didn’t have energy left for the nonsense…but again there is a middle ground…not everyone deserves rudeness not everyone is being annoying and as in everything both sides need to give 🤷‍♀️  But I absolutely get the struggle, financial aspect…I’m almost 40 my whole 20s and most 30s had multiple jobs and now when I am trying to make living with something I had to pay for education and have to regularly pay for to be able do the job I can’t meet end means and it sucks…and i probably have to have again another income to be able efford live and I already live in tiny apartment which I rent I have 20y old care I barely afford to maintain and if I won’t have at least 2 jobs I can not even afford this 🤷‍♀️ like what happened!? at this point I’m pretty sure it’s not me issue…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bro the server one got me I process things awkwardly in conversation due to a few issues with my brain so there usually is a silence when I'm being addressed for a second while my brain switches gears and catches up and someone having such an issue with that and broad strokes painting my generation as that is kinda disheartening. I always try to make up for it by smiling and saying thank you a lot I'm just a little wonky in my brain chemistry😢
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is interesting... I've honestly never seen anyone gen z do this stare at an inappropriate moment, such as greeting/being served/being asked basic questions in a customer service environment. I work in customer service and I'm between millennial and gen z (29).    Sometimes when I'm having a bad day before work and someone asks me how I'm doing I will just stare blankly to signify how I'm doing honestly... and then I'll say "well, I'm here" I personally hate telling someone I'm doing "good" "dandy" or "another day in paradise" if I'm not actually feeling okay. Why should I pretend for my coworkers when they know what I'm going through?   That being said, I do not share the same sentiment with a customer- I will tell them "I'm well today," and turn the conversation back to them. Being at work and working in customer service is about helping the customer to the best of my ability. Sometimes that means ignoring how I feel to make someone else's day better.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: oml this is what working this summer felt like for me. I was driven insane (like literally on the verge of hallucinating voices) by the exhausting people, then being told by higher ups that I wasn't being friendly enough simply because I was doing what I could to survive (the bare minimum, flat voice, not filling in blank gaps with small talk, etc.). I'm autistic and have never been great with consistently "good" tone and keeping a cheery smile on my face all day, but it's impossible for me to do customer service worker-type masking when my soul is dead inside. It was also usually older (35+) folks that drained my energy most
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's not necessarily the Gen Z stare, it's the "I'm so tired of your shit, are you stupid" stare.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I really like your not shitting on everyone and not ignoring context. Subscribed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I completely understand someone greeting you and the other person just staring at you not being verbal that can be a little off. But when it comes to working most people disassociate because you treated as a job, I just do my job and my work ethics needs to show more than the pleasantries. And I think that’s what the problem is. I’m actually feel more offended when people tell me no with a smile. I know that sounds very weird.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: TLDR: we tried to socialize (both irl or online). It hurt lots of us. Now we protect ourselves by not socializing.               Its also very important to note that for a lot of people in a lot of communitys it is dangerous to make small talk. As a young queer person who is very femme, men i have said hello to or complimented in the past have sexualized me gotten handsy and gross grabbed me and all the other aweful things that have happened. I said hi to a woman once and she cursed me out. I dont talk to people anymore and most of my freinds dont either. We know who to avoid and when forced to i teract with dangerous people we respond by avoiding small talk as much as possible. Its not that we dont believe we owe anyone anything its that we dont or cant speak to people because of fear and danger. Kids and young adults are exposed to so much more anger and hatred online because identity isnt involved by just seeing a comment. You might not yell at a kid but if you think its an adult that agression comes out. Most of these incidents happend when i was as you as 7-12. After i stopped socializing i stopped getting hurt. I know people from across the world and we all have the same experiences. Thats my explanation and everyone i knows explanation aswell
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Idk how I am annoying when I am just trying to pick up my food? 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Older gen z (98) and I’ve worked a lot of customer service rolls. I’ve never had a hard time making small talk or starting conversation. I am aware that I’m naturally more extroverted and outgoing. I have rarely had other gen z stare at me like that. I feel like I have mostly experienced it from older folks that don’t want your help when you’re simply doing your job. It’s like a lose / lose out here. You either don’t want help or when you do it’s because you’re likely impatient and didn’t take the time to understand what you need and I have to go from start to finish with you while you throw a hissy fit at me. The new gen will replace  us in the “lazy and inept” category. I think that’s just what they like to call “entering the workforce for the first time and learning to adapt.” It’s not immediate. It takes time. For some it’s natural. For others, it’s hard.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Excuse me... people actually stare when they're being talked to? like with just "hello" ?  what? I stare when I dont know the answer. I stare when I am spaced out. I stare when I'm trying to remember. all are not on purpose and  NOT JUST WITH HELLO. WHAT?  small talk is tough and all. but maybe this is just me not being able to small talk in a while because I didnt realize some small talk starters are rhetorical questions and I yap about my interests and ask them about theirs when they dont wanna yap about that, but small talk is rather simple to answer once you understand you say "I'm good how about you" everytime they hit you with the "whats up?".  I refuse to believe people actually stare because of small talk. small talk is something we understand. I think they're staring off for other reasons and some oldies decided to twist it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I actually love small talk like I love how whenever I say “it’s ridiculously hot out” (where I live in FL and it’s always hot outside) old ladies are always like “😤you’re telling me, I am going straight home after this and not moving the rest of the day” and then I continue with their transaction and as they’re leaving after saying “have a great rest of your day” I always add “and stay cool, go turn that AC up in your car!” and they eat it up like “oh I’m going to I’m dying out here!! 😮‍💨” and I work in retail so whenever they come up with their clothes to check out I love talking about how whatever they’re buying will be perfect for this heat bc it’s so thin, flowy, sleeveless etc and they light up after being validated in their choices
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My mom complained about this the other day and I just immediately asked her what she said that was so stupid 😂 she didn't like the implication but it turns out she was definitely asking a stupid question
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In retrospect, when I worked a desk job in a college dorm I was definitely occasionally guilty of the gen z stare but only when I really wanted someone to leave and they just were not getting the hint. There were a couple students who just wanted someone to chat with and I was a captive audience who wasn't allowed to be rude, so when I hit my limit I'd just get less and less reactive so as not to encourage them without saying anything that would get me fired
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “Staring on the outside, crying on the inside because I’m soooo done with youuuuu”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like, for the “ no gen z social skills?” Segment with that TikTok at the beginning, I’ve been guilty of that with servers at restaurants. The thing is, though, I was 15 or 16 fresh out of the pandemic and with family members who engaged in my stead. I don’t do that anymore now that I’ve been around people more and more often. My Gen Z Stare is more so what everyone else in our generation thinks it is, the look we give when someone says something absolutely blasphemous or horrible and you can’t say anything cuz you’d probably get kicked out/loose your job if you did lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think it's when an older generation who think's their entitled to respect, then proceed to ask the dumbest question on Earth. Like what else am I suppose to do beside look at you like your stupid?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Throwing out that thing about small talk; millenials didn't really get taught how to do it and since they taught Gen Z a lot of their social skills that was left out.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I worked in 2 different grocery stores, and when people would enter (if I was in the main part of the store) I would greet people and make small talk. When I first started however, I was having a hard time doing that as I get really anxious. But the longer I was working the easier it got and the more comfortable I was with talking to whoever. The reason I still struggle with talking to random people however is I'm afraid of saying something wrong because I don't know what's happened in that persons life. And if I do say smth wrong, I'm absolutely terrified of confrontation. But I do my best to interact with others as I know I can be super social in the right setting.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I agree entirely, I think there are a lot of Gen z who don’t understand where to use the gen z stare it’s like that person asked you a normal question just answer because it’s the kind thing to do REGUARDLESS of the scenario
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My only gripe with customers trying to do small talk is that they almost always try to do that when there's a long line of people also waiting to order. And people who are forced to wait longer for food get snappy and become the type of customer that will make me cry in my car later.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think a big reason young people are having such a hard time with the societal expectations of older people is because they don't follow their own rules. They expect us to be sweet and kind and polite but they don't afford us the same. They expect to be treated like human beings while they spit on us and look down on us for being trapped in the service industry because we are struggling to find other work. I can't tell you the amount of people I've had do or say the stupidest or most oblivious thing in the world and then turn around and treat me like I'm incompetent or below them because I work in retail. I've had to spend years and years in work that is inherently horrible for my mental and physical health because of the job market and then they manage to make it worse by pushing through me while telling me to excuse them or berating me over a dollar. If you want me to respect you, respect me too. It's a two way street and I think young people are very aware of how we're expected to do most of the heavy lifting. Thank you for acknowledging that everyone is entitled because I've honestly never seen a gen z or millennial throw a tantrum like boomers and gen x. Somehow the ones always telling us we have a problem with "instant gratification" are the ones with the actual problem.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Brother I've worked and been to so many workplaces and I've NEVER gotten this kind of stare wtf
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I agree a lot with this. But i live in denmark where you don’t EVER ask strangers “how are you” so when i worked in costumer service and americans would ask me that, i would panic and just stare at them. Cause to me THATS SUCH A STRANGE THING TO ASK A STRANGER. Even tho i knew i was just supposed to say “good how about you”, i blanked every time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: growing up when covid was happening, i think it definitely set us back a little bit because we literally couldn’t interact with people on purpose for a long period of tome
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As someone who was diagnosed with epilepsy and ended up with concentration problems I was only able to improve my social awareness through work and my friend
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't talk when I get a call because if I don't the little sensor thing they use to do scams marks me as someone that doesn't answer or something.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i usually just stare in silence at people after they said something insanely offensive in the most casual way. 10 out of 10 times they don't even notice my shock and keep going
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ve been accused of doing the “gen z stare” mostly because i’m suspected to have ASD and cannot make eye contact with people and typically look over their shoulder or like a different part of their face. I can hold a conversation, i just can’t look you in the eye
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I only wait for the person on the other end to speak first when they call so I can hang up on bots without wasting my breath.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I remember when millenials were called lazy and socially inept. It just reminds me of a story I heard about a teacher complaining about their students moving to paper instead of carving on tablets saying something along the lines of "They'll never know the pemanence of what they are writing and what it takes to really put thought into every letter you place" (I'm paraphrasing). This happens with every generation for thousands of years.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 41y socially anxious and introverted elder millennial who always pushed myself to be extroverted with strangers so people wouldn’t call me out on it. It is exhausting and I don’t blame Z for wanting to avoid all of the pretense.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I gave this stare to a lady who went on a rant about how i should sell alcohol and cigarettes to her 9 year old because they were for her  There was a cop behind her she got arrested (unrelated to why she was yelling at me)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I stare off to space a lot, not because somebody is irritating usually. Just because I need to zone out before answering a question because it makes me more comfortable to think before answering 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m gen Z, I used to work at one of the busiest starbucks in the nation, my managers would put so much emphasis on connecting with every customer but there was always cars every second of the day. That’s trying to small talk for 30 seconds for each person from 9-5 essentially. That pressure was so intense I would literally have to run off and throw up between cars because the anxiety was nauseating. I had to quit becauseI literally can’t talk to anyone anymore without tweaking out, I now clean houses and barely speak to anyone. Part of the gen z stare was people asking dumb questions but the other part was I was literally trying to keep the last threads of my being from snapping and withering away.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm not going to lie when I was a kid I was the sweetest little thing who was just nice to people because why not. Gradually I got beat down and pretty much treated like some dumb dog because nothing I said mattered. Everything I said would be treated as stupid, invalid or rude. The best thing to ever happen to my mental health was taking the golden rule id worshipped since childhood and REALLY follow it. If they treat me like trash I'll be nice until finally I give them back their energy. I have had a ROUGH childhood full of abuse but I chose to be happy and nice and that's always labeled as naive and people think I was sheltered as a kid. Anyway all this is to say if you're a stranger I immediately expect you to be an ass by default and if you're an older person you're always going to say something rude or judgemental if I let you think you can have an actual conversation with me. I don't start conversations because I don't know how to end them because y'all will talk for HOURS about the same thing. Btw if I'm working at a fast food joint while going to school and taking care of my siblings the last thing I want to hear is some rude dumb@ss old man saying "You're a pretty girl why don't you just have your boyfriend work for you?"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I haven’t been on social media besides YT for 4 years now. I still do the stare 😂😂😂😂 I love Gen Z I think we are a revolution waiting to happen. The older generations are afraid of how little we care to conform!!! They were too afraid to fight back but maybe we’re not
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I see this type of stare in every age group, they’re  just giving an awkward or “why am I here” stare a new name.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ok in regard to answering the phone has no one else ever heard that you're not supposed to say hello in case it's a scam caller??? i swear i was told this at some point so now i always wait until i hear a human voice on the other end
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a neurodivergent older gen z, I thought the stare was something only I did. Just a random zone-out when basic human communication suddenly becomes overwhelming for absolutely no reason.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Being dead honest, I’ve been told “ Hey how’s your day?” Before and I’ll respond, but then I ask it back and I never get a response- it makes it annoying since I’m trying to do the same thing back but I get stared at like I’m stupid. It makes me want to stop doing small talk since I get treated dumb for it. (I’m Gen Z too)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If I just stare at someone blankly while they're asking a question, it's because I'm either shocked at what they said, or I just think they're being annoying and don't wanna answer   I don't do it often at all, but when it happens, it's mostly the latter
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i ended up absorbing the concept of "do unto others as you wish others do unto you", if i dont greet someone, it means i dont expect them to greet me, i wouldnt help someone for no reward and i dont expect to be helped without a cost, i just dont know how im supposed to start a conversation without feeling weird because i think the other person thinks im weird
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly it’s just me computing, like I can’t comprehend the fact that somebody is PHYSICALLY talking to me, it’s just incomprehensible I need a minute.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I know I sometimes stare into the void when I'm rattling my brain for an answer.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I work at fast food restaurant, as a cashier, im 16 and i always smile and welcome everyone, but my gen x manager is real example of "gen s stare"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im a millennial, and ive /never/ been on the recieving end of the "gen z stare", i have done it though. Usually when I do it, its me trying to process the stupidity without being "disrespectful". In my head im just saying "How tf have you survived? Gtfo." But on the outside im taking a breath and trying not to lose my job.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i had some middle aged white lady come into my workplace while i was on register once and ask for a cheeseburger with "No patty, cheese, pickles, ketchup or bun." like?? do u want the box???? I generally try not to work register cause where i live theres alot of ppl like this but YEAH if u try and order a burger with nothing on it IM GONNA LOOK AT U A LITTLE FUNNY  edit a day later because apparently pausing a video and coming back to it 5+ hours later is my favorite thing  lowk there is a line for stuff like this like obv if im working in food service i should be socially presentable to customers/co workers, even if theres a manager i dislike i still have to pretend to get along with them. But this kiiinda falls off in the office small talk thing. like a "hi hru" isnt bad but why am i expected to talk to u abt anything other than my job. im not saying dont talk to anyone in the office but like, if i dont like u im not gonna go out of my way to make small talk, i dont know u like that bro
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 18:40 as someone who has really bad social anxitey (I get panic attacks at grocery stores for example) , I hate hearing people mocking it. I try my best to be kind and talk to people but sometimes its hard thanks to the fact I've had a lot of people hurt me in the past. I wish people would be more understanding to people like me and those who are "akward."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My mom used to tell me as a kid “STOP LOOKING AT ME WITH THAT LOOK!!” I had no idea what she meant at the time lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've worked customer service and hit people with that Gen Z stare "why isn't my sandwhich half-off like the promotion??" "Sir you ordered a wrap".   But right now I'm interning at a major corporation and somehow stumbled into a team of mostly very introverted GenX and Boomers, a handful of middle-to-older Millenials, and one older GenZ. I'm an awkward person, always have been, but they treat me normally and with respect. I've never GenZ stared them unless I didn't know what to do, in which case they're usually also staring lol. They like me and my work despite my awkwardness, because the entire team is also awkard haha! Funny enough I'm usually the one for office small talk more than most!  Anyway, just mentioning that because peak social behavior is not even slightly required in a lot of office jobs. Mutual respect and decent communication is all that's needed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like I do know that i DO have the whole gen z stare thing, but its literally only because I get extremely overstimulated in public spaces and my brain is trying to tune everything out so its not overwhelming.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As like a Gen Z here (yayyy 🤭✨️) uh i am VERY bad w social interactions, so uh i am quite used to awkward silence.. but when working, i always say Hi to both custormers and coworkers. Not only does it make it alot less awkward, it also makes a good impression. I have people sometimes help me w stuff, that i don't know, just because i say hi and 'try' to do small talk.. try because i'm still working on it 😭✨️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I didn't even realize it until I read the title. But I've never been gen z stared at before
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I love how you said an explanation is not an excuse to the older generations
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i am kind of socially awkward, and because of that i have kind of a "script" that i use in situations where i have to make small talk with people/order anything, and it's usually based on the politeness that is expected by older people, so when people around my age are more straightforward (using hey, instead of good morning or bye instead of goodbye, where in my country the difference is bigger cause we only use "you" when we know someone, and mr/mrs when we don't) it just really stuns me and i feel like my brain is short-circuiting 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hate small talk. Not because it's pointless, but because I hate being approached by randoms in public. If I wanted to meet new people, I would have went to a pub and sat right at the bar, let me do my groceries in peace
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: One of the most common thing i experiece is people asking the most obvious questions like "oh you got hazelnut coffee? does it have hazelnut in it?" or when i come home after college and people go "youre home?" WHAT DO YOU THINK? DO U SEE MY SPIRIT???
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Am I being too prosocial in college asking to share a table with those who are alone? They won’t even say hi or “yes” when I ask to sit.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Okay, this is a small note because on the bigger scope of the video, I agree with what is said, but I want to point out the minor flaw of "small talk and pleasantries makes life better 100% of the time" is very rooted in the notion that extrovertism is the standard and introverts are a negative break from that format.  To use the specific example in the video of a train (or bus or any public transit really) where you either sit quietly or engage in conversation with your fellow passangers, having done both I can confidently say I much prefer the peace and quiet in that setting. But that is tied to my personality type, not necessarily the generation I was born in.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: See I’m a server ,and gen z and I feel like I get the stare from every other generation way more than gen z. I feel like older generations get away with things that are very disrespectful and critical of us when no one is the same. Some people just ain’t raised correctly in all generations. Tell me how when I go up to a table of 28-45 year olds they are old talking over me and looking at me like I’m crazy for asking how their food is tasting !!! Let’s start that slander
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: One of the things that I think people need to focus on are the fact that people aren’t reading anymore they expect people to read to them. It’s like reading comprehension skills are not a thing anymore, but they expect everyone else to have it. I’m not sure if anyone has experience people coming into a job and straight up not reading signs or directions
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an older gen z, I only stare at people who say stupid stuff, ask stupid questions or are disrespectful but think I’m going to be respectful.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m middle gen z and work with people that are much older than me  when it comes to small talk I struggle to join because I haven’t experienced the same things as them so I don’t join the conversation

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Older gen z here at 24 yrs old. Honestly, things like this, seeing my generation have empathy and passion, gives me hope
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's also very interesting that all of these things were said about millennials, then we got too old, and media switched it to being traits of Gen-Z more or less overnight with a few modifications.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They didn’t hit until the hopelessness part, but this is how people describe prison. Boredom, unease, anger, hopelessness, isolation, being involved in a system you cannot escape from, seeing authority as hostile, using addictions to cope and getting lost in them, but still having a need to continue on because what else is there?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “I promise I’m not an academic, I do this all out of spite” get it girl,  I’ve never felt so seen, out of all the political essay stuff I’m seeing on yt since I’ve stopped being apolitical, you have to be one of the very best ones. Instant sub, let’s radicalize some mofos
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Turned 40 and I try to explain to my mom why her students are disengaged. This video summed it up well.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the phone is not bad. the phone is a tool. social media? also a tool. but removing physical socialization from a highly social species? thats very very VERY bad! tools are not replacements!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1:23:41 I think that’s the root of the malaise Gen Z feels: powerlessness. We know what the problems are, we have ideas for solutions but because of the lack of resources and the system that’s been stacked against us, we don’t have any power to change anything.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Something that isn't noted in a lot of anti-war discussion about Gen Z is how much outcry there was about Iraq and the disasterous war on terror by Millennials and Gen X. I can say from that perspective we were painted as unamerican, malcontents and told we were ignorant.. nothing about these demonstrations is novel except that the narrative has escaped the media.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Aside from the existential dread of learning Mia Cole is younger than me (23). I think this video does a phenomenal job at conveying that the mere act of fighting, or trying, to make the world a better place is in its own right an improvement. And that even if it doesn't guarantee change, it's the only path that doesn't guarantee a lack thereof. Which, I feel, is a very prevalent understanding in our generation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I once had to explain why gen z americans are so unpatriotic to my gen x dad. I told him that we've never had a reason to be. We were toddlers at best when 9/11 happened, so we don't remember the surge of national pride that followed. What we remember is the long-term aftermath: the surveillance state, increased islamophobia, everything in the middle east, etc. The news about Abu Ghraib broke in 2004. We've never seen patriotism used for good, we've only seen it mask nationalism that is used for cruelty and exploitation. Sometimes this makes us cynical and apathetic, but I think it also helps us ignore national borders. Other than ironic feuds with the British and jokes about the Olympics, many of us have very little loyalty to an arbitrary national identity. When we see people suffering, like those in Gaza, we don't care if they're our country's allies or not. I think that can be a very powerful thing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It was such an interesting experience to watch my family go from loving Greta thunberg and looking at us as “the generation to save them” but instantly flip on her and us for pushing the boundaries on actual change and providing actual ideas for change. (They also sometimes look down on me for actually participating in community building)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Was pointed to this channel and in 5 min my blood pressure is up and eyes are dilating. Subscribed
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an older millenial, the thing I want to communicate to gen-X folks and folks in my own generation is this: The Kids Are Not Alright, but they'll be damned if they're going to take it lying down. We need to SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE. To be CRYSTAL FUCKING CLEAR, "support young people" doesn't mean "pat them on the back and tell them they are the future." It means "build a better world so they can live the happy lives we promised they would." They are not here to finish the race for us. We must stop kicking the can down the road and stand with them, not just hand them the reigns and hope for the best.  Thank you, Mia, for both the incredible amount of work you put into these videos, the guests you brought on to speak, and for giving me a little boost whenever I am worried about the people who will come after me.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This hits my heart so so hard. At 50, all i can say is "You are absolutely right."  And when I was young and with your fire, we didn't have the numbers. And I've been fighting for 30ish years. And as tired as you are. I am so so so tired.  I know as bad as it was for me, it is getting worse. And while i agree with the slow changing arc of history, it is SO VERY SLOW. And everything else moves SO VERY FAST.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I read a quote somewhere that says that the easiest way to take someone's power away is to convince them that they don't have any, and at the end of the day, I think that's true.  The main thing that the powerful have that the plebs don't is the audacity.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Try to find a way to distinguish between the syate of the world and your own personal life, that's the best way I've found to handle the state of everything.  The world is going to hell, things are about to get wayyy worse, but as a person I've never felt better and more fulfilled in life because I've explored my passions and they've born fruit in the forms of songs and stories that I feel have the potential to greatly affect people. I've conquered some of my greatest demons and mastered how to control the social anxiety that ruined me as a teenager.  If the world is doomed either way, I'm gonna focus on myself and making sure I'm having some kind of fun before shit hits the fan. I've only got one life, and you gotta play woth the hand life deals you. Imma be the best version of myself when it all falls apart

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: we do it to ourselves because we like the lack of compromise that independence provides. We were already doing this before social media.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 46, old enough that I remember the internet in its infancy. Being able to get online at all was a novelty, an escape. Now, the internet is ubiquitous, and unplugging, sitting in a quiet room without any screens on or notifications chirping, is the escape. Funny how things change.   As a species, I think we’re not ready to have instantaneous, 24/7 access to anyone in the world, or to the sum of human knowledge, in our pockets. Our brains just aren’t equipped to handle it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Some of us have to, no other place to go. :(
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: But nobody is doing that. who do you know that goes on social media when they would have been socializing in person? Because I only know people who go on social media when they would've been at home alone.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SpecialBlanket  I went on social media because there was no one to play with in my neighborhood and I was scared to go any further then nearby houses due to a sheltered upbringing. I don't really go outside nowadays because I can't drive (working on that though) and there aren't really any community places nearby that don't require pay. Plus no one else wants to go outside and hang out---probably for similar reasons---so I don't really have anyone to hang out with nearby.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @SpecialBlanket  Take it you haven't been in a school in the last 20 years, huh?  2000s? Yeah kids were socializing and making plans to hang out outside of school.  2010's onwards though? Isolating as hell if you were one of the few kids who didn't have social media access on hand, and in-person socializing  was usually limited to who you already knew. Kids didn't give a damn about strangers and tended to steer clear to avoid being awkward.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @SpecialBlanket  people are at home alone more often because they're on social media. Boredom used to be a drive to go and do things. Now boredom is a drive to go on social media.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Exactly. Money is power in this world and we're ruled by billionnaires who are becoming richer by the hour while we become poorer. I don't see how we stand a chance.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ I think the best thing to do is collective local action, as stated near the end of the video. A fuckin town in like Kentucky voted to dissolve and give control to the county so changes in government locally is possible. That said, if we want more people to be receptive to our messaging I think we have to reach them where they are and prove that our ideas actually work and will help them. Problem solving.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @chalkfarm11 If  you had money, you would do exactly the same  thing.  3, 4, 5 hours a day on social media isnt going to help is it?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And that's all very intentional. As Gary Kasparov put it, the aim of modern propaganda isn't to win you over, it's to induce exhaustion and despair so that you remove yourself from the conversation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The problem is capitalism and class conflict so all this fragmentation of the vast majority who don't belong to the imperialist ruling plutocracy by dividing people by race, age, sexual identity etc is totally counterproductive.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And I think the nail in the coffin is the “rotting” of our attention spans and patience. The first step to learning how to fix a problem is sitting down and learning; reading and doing research. But the research required to effectively organize and solve these issues is more than a lot of our generation is used to. Makes it even worse that companies like Facebook prey on this short attention span and actively hope to consume even more of our time
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: every generation felt powerless in their formative years
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yup! Lots of us were protesting the war in Iraq too.    I don't think the story escaped popular media. It's being suppressed or written in a very particular narrative.   I'm genuinely proud of gen Z for talking about these issues
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Agreed. I was in my teens for 9/11 and if you dared criticize the wars, that meant you disrespected the Americans serving, took “our freedoms” for granted and looked at like a traitor. There was so such thing as questioning the war(s) post 9/11 because “we were saving the Middle East”. We were “too young” to have a say but weren’t young enough to be shipped off to war.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah I keep wondering if Palestine will be this generation's Vietnam.

This isn't a generational divide that's what young people are like.   Also screw you. I was 9 years old when 9/11 happened. Why the hell are you blaming a 9 year old for the war on terror?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @myself2noone  I think that was supposed to be the point: Millenials and Gen X were vocal against Iraq and the War on Terror (despite being surrounded by a lot of patriotic noise) that the Gen Z antiqar protests shouldn't be surprising

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “When we see people suffering, we don’t care if they’re our allies” is so profound.  Yesterday I went to work excited for the new year. The first customer came to so me, a man ~70 y/o, and we are chatting about the local football event. Joking about how we would rather be there than here, in this grocery store. Then, immediately after, he brought up that 14+ people were just killed in New Orleans that morning… and he was upset that it put a pause on their football celebrations?   The amount of sorrow I (0’3 born Gen Z) felt was so heavy that I shed a tear. Not only for the loss of these people, but the only thing he, and many others, had care for was the football events… like WHAT!?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @opu_exe  I'm in my 30's. The wildfires in LA and the New Orleans attacks actually causd me to write to my Aunt in the US, who thanked me for reaching out. That's more powerful than anything. It's an Aunt I haven't seen for two or three years, an awesome person. The kind of person who, when she knew I was going to the US, went to her local Hallmark store and sent me videos of loads of ornaments with sounds on them before revealing hay, that store was ten minutes away from her and we'd be going. I was so gosh darned happy during that trip, and indeed we went to that store and my gosh, it was an awesome 30 minutes of my life I'll never forget because the amount of stuff there that made sounds was incredible. I'm a blind person, and these ornaments talked, played music, some interacted with each other, some even moved! It was incredible.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it's funny because that goes in parallell with how Millennials experienced politics, all of the optimism of the 90s were gone as soon as the 2000s rolled around
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: A lot of Gen Xers also grew up during the Cold War. Not enough people talk about the intense propoganda during that period
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Couldn't have said it better myself
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In most latin america that has been the case for, like, the last 4 generations. There is some talk about that, 'cause we generally think is so weird you guys in the US are so bizarrely patriotic. The general consensus is that you maintain patriotism not by giving a good living to your citizens, but by having lots of enemies. For us, the enemy has always been within.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @estebanreyes7171  we are patriotic because we have no singular culture or race or religion to keep us united.  I think they call it “civic religion”.  As a social phenomenon, the US NEEDS patriotism (or anti-patriotism which does the same job) as a sort of social glue.   It’s interesting and makes sense the more you think about it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Every one of these "why don't they?" boomer questions is answered "why would they?"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: REAL!!! I JUST WANT HUMANITY TO WORK TOGETHER TO SURVIVE, we need to stop fighting for beliefs and start fighting for our future, and the future of humanity as a whole.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as a millenial I remember the surge of patriotism from 9/11, and then what made me not be patriotic was all the things you just listed, basically thrown back at us as a byproduct of our patriotism. It made me become very critical of this country.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Zectifin   @skypuppeteer Here’s my world view the best i can explain in a comment with the little time i have rn….  The Patriotic moment after 9/11 was short and sus to me from the start.   I shared in the empathy for the dead since i live about 6 minutes from the towers and watched it happen, knew many that died.  It was my first day of college actually.     But anyway, regardless of their terrible actions, the US governments lies and crazy response was an abuse of our emotional state of mind.  Thats what’s important.  And this is key, the reason so many millennials who were very against the gov response back then are now supporting the Trump coalition today is because those groups they’re tearing down?  Most of them are to blame in one way or another for so much of that madness.   And whatever Trump may be, he’s a wrecking ball, and after seeing the cycle play out over and over, at least it’s catharsis to many.  Not saying they’re right…but i get it.  Reform hasn’t gotten us anywhere so f it?  But i digress…  They have been using the young left’s same emotional state and naïveté as they did with that anger and patriotism after 9/11.   I personally think they did it with pushing identity activism after they realized Occupy Wall Street was a potential threat to the actual ppl in power.  So they manipulated the Left to break their focus on bankers and law makers who caused the Recession and had us focus on ourselves based on race, sexuality, gender etc.  EVERYONE of those issues has been specifically inflamed since around 2012-14 and that’s right when Occupy dissolved.  It was VERY odd how big tech and banks supported BLM and Pride since they’d never supported any cause before, right? But it saved the bankers butts who gambled our savings, destroyed countless lives and then had the gov save them with our tax money cuz we weren’t looking at them anymore.  It’s like this mass focus on intersectionality appeared over night.  I’ve been aware of various cultural and political theory far longer than that, but it had never hit the mainstream until Occupy got too loud and too focused.  Also, notice the most DEI focused companies STILL have white guys as CEO’s lol.  Bob Iger??? wtf?  It’s all a game to them at the top.  They’ll gladly drop some white middle mgmt guy for the optics of appearing to care about social justice but their big fat ass isn’t moving out of the big chair, that’s for damn sure!  They do this kinda thing every time the news hammers a story of a white cop and Black victim.  They terrorize Black Americans into living in constant fear, they upset allies, causes a mass reaction and it’s all for one reason; to have “issues” for politicians to run on, and fear and anger to make people move with.  The reason id say with confidence i know its not authentic news is because in the last few years on avg you usually have around 700 or so white victims of cops, 200-300 Black victims and YES, when it comes to population size, that’s more Black victims per capita, but with zero white victims and so many unreported Black victims, how come we don’t know a single name or incident but the few Black victims they push hard as hell for?  The ones with white cops? Not ONE white guy out of thousands over the last 5 years was killed in an interesting enough way to make the news?  lol  And no, i’m not saying “poor white ppl”, i’m saying, it’s odd to leave out nearly a thousand deaths at police hands each year, except the ones most likely to cause racial division over the evil/dumb actions of a single cop here and there.  THAT is how u spot an agenda.  It’s not social justice, it’s social engineering.  And it’s causing more harm and division than any of the actual police incidents. And  those cops are murderers!     Not to mention, if everyone knew the real numbers, Black americans would very likely feel less persecuted, cause based on the “facts” given by the Times, MSNBC or w/e, and amplified by activists, you SHOULD feel like a deer in the woods with hunters all around! But that’s not reality.  People full of fear are the most malleable citizens though, because they are very very easy to move how you want them to, no matter if they’re geniuses or fools.  Fear is a powerful drug.  No matter what the media or activists tell you, never trust any issue with only two positions, cuz the piece of the puzzle they leave out is ALWAYS the part that has any value towards truth.    One more example….Regarding Abu Ghiraib…i was also shocked when i first learned of it.  But that’s ONE crappy little prison and atrocity is par for the course in war.  When i started to look into all the nations in active wars?  OMG Abu Ghiarab was like a party compared to watching gallons of blood drain from secret MP safe house in Tanzania.  Or seeing locals dig up fresh mass graves in a warehouse in Myanmar.  I can go on and on.  Humans with power, media and emotional well meaning citizens ready to march will always do evil things.    You need to be strong enough to know the ugly but remain skeptical and find context otherwise that’s exactly how you end up being the next torturer.   Powerful people have become godlike, tech and info is there weapon to wield, and all we can do is try not to jump when they tell us to.  Because it’s rarely the way you think it is, so i recommend watching and listening long before you decide to roll up your sleeves.   Just cuz someone points and say “that’s the bad guy!” doesn’t mean the guy pointing isn’t even worse!  Sorry to sound like a nihilist, but tbh i feel great empathy, it’s just that im a realist and i dont wanna jump for anyone but myself and the ppl i love.  Trust is great but it’ll make you into a monster if placed recklessly.  ❤️ 🇺🇸 🌍 🍆 😜
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This needs to be pinned📍Gen Z approved
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This. Couldn’t agree more. Hell, some of us were born BECAUSE of 9/11 since our parents were stressed out and tried to comfort each other that way, lots of summer babies in 2002.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My mother is gen x, she used to be extremely patriotic actually. But she has grown cynical with this country.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a (European) millenial and I remember watching the news on 9/11. I have your exact relationship to 9/11. My hatred against the US started with watching the very event you mention unfold.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I kind of want to know your dad's response
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @darkwolfag12  He was mostly understanding, but he still has a pretty American exceptionalist perspective, so he didn't quite get it. He knows the US has problems, but he also thinks that literally everywhere else in the world is worse, and that was a whole can of worms I didn't even try to deal with. Basically, he tried to be open-minded but he still kind of thinks gen z is just ungrateful.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So I have a counter point- I’m a dual citizen and half my family is across the Atlantic in Europe. Things are significantly worse there than us Americans typically understand. I am deeply patriotic and am a conservative tbh because a decent amount of my family is living under a sort of totalitarian state where elections are canceled and people live in fear for even getting caught praying in their homes or saying anything against the government or liking a post. I can’t even contact my family for fear of their safety. America is a wonderful nation and I see America as what stands between death cults, authoritarianism expanding, and the western world. I am not patriotic despite what we have done globally but because of it and I believe the survival of America is  paramount
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: More of gen z are aware now, how 9/11 came about..  US foreign interference and violence in the middle east..  nothing to be proud about.   They are more clear now that fascism can happen anywhere..   they are also more aware of the violence of the food industry, and ecological destruction.    And how adults just keep doing the same stupid stuff.   Meanwhile they are the ones being targeted, of being stupid, and naive.  That they should simply adapt and play the same game..   so you get those who rebel, and those who cynically join the 'normality' of adulthood, following the trump/biden dynamic of political cowardice.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hell I was born like 04 and i didn't even know about Abu Gahriab because I was litterally a baby.  I should look into that because with 9/11 I was still on my father's balls waiting to be born.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I wouldn't call what happened after 911 "National pride" as much as "Going postal because someone broke your Lego".
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠@alfsmith4936 There was a surge in patriotism post 9/11. There is a pew article on the matter, but it cites how more people came together and rallied around the nation… no matter what it did.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @alfsmith4936 yup. I was in Lousiana when it happened and remember talking to a dude in a bar who just wanted revenge on the middle East in general. I remember thinking at the time that this'll just give the US president the power to do whatever he wants while the backlash energy lasted. I was right but I'm not happy about that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Humanity is what matters. I’ve always felt this, always understood the inhumanity of nations like ‘israel’ who oppress their neighbors with ever greater indulgence by my govt no ,atter which party was in charge. I was indoctrinated to love the Zionists and empathize with them. Instead I rejected Zionism and identified since adolescence with the Palestinians. I grasped that they had a real gripe against the settler colonialists and that the side with the nukes has ALL the responsibility to make peace. Humanity is being crushed in Gaza and the west bank. It has since 1948. Finally a generation can recognize the Palestinian plight en masse. This is a great development.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The funny nugget here is Gen Z is not really as unique as we like to believe. Gen X knows this. When you eschew your "I'm special I'm Gen Z" priors, things look different. That said, a good video.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Anti-Identity-Entity  so what causes you stop thinking this way? exhaustion? apathy? a genuine disdain for the other humans that inhabit this earth? that's what we're not getting--we've grown up being shown photos from the world wars, the cold war, the vietnam war, of people protesting against the continued fighting, more specifically with ones from the vietnam war over the others, so we know that this is not a sentiment that only we have experienced. but that begs the question, why are you against it now? why have you stopped fighting?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Understood.  You'll be patriotic in the blink of an eye when WWIII breaks out.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You don't need to trust the gov, but you do need a government.  I wonder why you think you think you get to not learn the real issues you're bloodline elders should have memory of.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is behavioral sink psychosis, this is recognizable throughout history, and people such as polybius recognized it in the ancient world.   As we get too many people crammed into one area, we perceive the ability for ourselves to have become contained or boxed in.   We now are connected globally and have a perception that earth is a full cage. We are sorting, and the good genetics are having kids, and the bad are falling into self worship, or hedonistic tendencies.    If you think retried, broken ideas are the future, then I'm sorry to tell you you do not know what's going on.    We need to expand our cage, or forever live under totalitarian rule.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also @comments spell check is actually really important as nothing minimizes your argument like misspelling crucial words. Since all we can do is read it makes you seem like a child who hasn't learned to spell yet, and thus casts your argument as something a child would say lol. Like, a regular autocorrect mistake is fine but an explicit misspelling is pretty bad lmao. Like you couldn't be bothered to put enough time in to the thought to get correct spelling. Like you've obviously never read the common word and thus appear much less well read and thus less credible.   Of course this is a snooty thing to say, I'm not saying it to discredit you, I'm saying it to help you arm yourself against future attempts to discredit you. Good luck random people and things and stuff and things or whatever

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "political violence"  First I want to make a distinction between political violence and civil disobediance   Political violence may have it's place...but as a cis het man don't expect me to live up to your overly realistic standards  civil disobediance on the other hand  I can get on board with that as I feel it applies to the proper role I should serve in my society

There's the internet.  It's a sharp tool but mostly covered in sludge.  Are we starting to focus in on who or what needs it's 'attention' yet?  Instead of the new blaming the old for everything - have we identified the real, perennial problem?  There will be something, weaving through the whole of human history, that needs to 'feel our steel'.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As another 50 year old, I agree with you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a younger millennial, I completely agree. I’m exhausted too. Back in the late 2000s and early to mid-2010s, it felt like we were finally gaining momentum, and there was real hope that Gen Z and Alpha could carry the torch and make meaningful progress. But now, it feels like we’ve regressed, especially within my demographic of white males. It’s shifting the opposite direction to  fascism.  That said, some of the people in the video struck me as a bit self-important, almost as if they believe their efforts surpass what previous generations did in their youth.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @woozle-s7r Divide and conquer.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am an '04 zoomer It doesn't matter if the issue is war, environment, housing, healthcare, identity politics, civil rights, etc. My opinions stay the same:  I want people to stop dying, and I want people to have the right to make their own decisions.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just an FYI to the audience Scott is also one of those cranks that looks at birth rates and the lack of sex that gen Z reports having is due to basically the generation's "woke-ness". He's also held this weird fascination with people in high school having sex for like almost 2 decades now too so make of that what you will.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Let's not forget either that the protests to end the war in Vietnam were not taken seriously until the protests at Kent State that was televised where everyone saw the national guard shooting at the protesters. Even though the protest was not intended to be violent, because of the violence caused by the police and seen in everyone's living rooms, that was what really got America paying attention and listening to the students. Nixon started pulling people out of Vietnam in the wake of that protest, and the reaction that followed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The thing about empathy is that it took me a long time and a depressive episode to realize that empathy connects you to others, but if those others are in pain, it causes you pain. And people can only take so much pain before they go numb. The internet connects us to a lot of people. The numbness of every generation that has grown up online seems to be consequential.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 23 year old gen z  here, my biggest struggle in the last few months as I've tried to disconnect from the internet and social media is that most of my friends no longer want to do things outside of video games and shit online. its concerning to me how many young adult males are addicted to video games/the internet, (not to mention the recent epidemic in online gambling) and think its totally ok to spend all their time on this. all I wish for is real human interaction with people I can relate to without this vail of social media cramming all this meaningless slop down my throat. its been very hard to feel positive about these things but I will never give up thanks to people like this. great video!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm older Gen Z (23) and im exhausted. Extremely, and utterly... exhausted. Mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually. I'm so damn lonely and wish i was never born into this world. My mom couldn't break the cycle of abuse, and when i thought i could escape that- it became nearly impossible. I'm afraid of never having a future, and it always being this way. Nothing changing is one of my biggest fears.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Time really is a circle, as others have pointed out the experiential divide between gen z and millennials is practically nonexistent.   I was in high school for the occupy wall street movement, in college for the first election of DJT.  And I cared, persistently, year after year. I got tired, I feel hopelessness regularly. But after a decade of toiling I am 6 months away from being an attorney for low income tenants. I will help keep dozens of people housed just in my first year. That won’t fix the world, but it’ll make it just a tiny bit better.  Ultimately, that’s all we can do. Find your lane, and do what you can with what you have. You’ll even find community on the other side of people doing the exact same thing as you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a disabled person who was physically bullied growing up, who was constantly victim blamed and had to hide every day, who had little to no friends and explored much of the world through the context of Legend of Zelda, Avatar (airbender), etc. I have never understood how people don’t get that violence is often necessary to eradicate the oppressive violence that’s the norm. How people don’t understand the status quo IS violence.   Like, did y’all not read ANY history? Did you never see how minorities were treated around you? Like…it’s obvious.   I didn’t always know about the system as a whole, the complexities of history and how we got here, the political landscape, etc. but ever since I was that 6 year old being bullied, I knew you had to use violence to save yourself at times, and that the rules are not there to save you, but to keep a false peace and silence victims.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Imagine seeing your (boomer) parents driving a "car" and talking about how awesome, convenient, and relaxing it is. They go out of their way to really rub it in your face, saying things about how cool their "car" is and how awesome it is to drive. And one day they all get old and are showing they can no longer drive the "car" anymore. So you go up to them and ask if they can teach you how to drive it, and they just say, "nah, I have houses to go buy in mass so you can't have a home".   That is how a lot of millennials feel about the situation with how we haven't even been shown how to take over and carry on this sort of government. Not like we much cared for it to begin with. But, you'd think these people would understand that they are on their way out and they haven't done anything to prepare us in how to clean up their mess. It feel deliberately offensive, almost like a generational attack.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like powerlessness and tragedy has been a defining feature of the last three generations...from genx to z and alpha just can't cope anymore and...that's depressing.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just want to live through precedented times again
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i feel like the characterization of gen z as being progressive or leftist is kind of a huge generalization and it causes us to lower our guard and then get surprised when gen zers turn out conservative or even far right. these influences on us; the distrust of the government and failures of our institutions and climate change can easily turn a gen zer into a hypercapitalist or far right. and even the leftists in our generation are Not Immune to Propaganda, and we repeat the oppression we should be fighting against pretty easily if we aren't well versed in intersectionality.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What if people want the right to kill other people?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @SerenGetter  This argument falls apart because that would require violating other people's rights.  If you try to twist the argument to self defense when it's clearly just arbitrary murder, well that falls on its face as well.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This was a helpful way to understand empathy in myself- the only way I could think of it was comparing it to connecting yourself to an electrical current- if the amperage exceeds your capacity- you get burnt but otherwise it would connect you directly and viscerally to the forces of the world and can be a good connection to be self-aware of  (Idk I don't know a linguistic way to describe a lot of what I experience)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is exactly why its so important to unplug from the Internet and to keep your in person friends close. We are social creatures, and social media is the largest double edged sword we've ever created. In small doses it can generate great empathy, but too much has the opposite effect and burns you out, just as you explained.  Put down the phone, make your time intentional and things get a whole lot more manageable. Those 30 minutes you spent scrolling TikTok could've been used to cook a meal, read a chapter in a book, or hell just to play video games or do something that's actually relaxing and not mind numbing.  Work/life balance is important, just as important as internet/life balance imo. An imbalance in either can royally screw up a person's mental health
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an actual Zillenial (Quarter 1 '97, so 27 almost 28 yo) Kind of hurt to read "older Gen Z (23)". Feels like my age demographic of 95-99 don't really exist or are ignored. Maybe that's just me though cause I feel like I align a lot of talking points with both Y and Z . I have what Y had: inspiration for a better future with the rampant growth of technology that was developed by Gen W and X. Simultaneously I have what Z has: the exhaustion and crushing reality of hopelessness that is analogous to The Great Depression times.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yo, if you're feeling hopeless, don't fade away into the dark. Go out in a blaze of glory. Make your life mean something. Luigi had the right idea
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: fuck everyone whos trying to tell you to stop sharing your feelings, because I feel the same way and your comment is way more validating than any one of those "comebacks" coukd ever be. thank you for sharing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Coming from someone slightly younger, this feeling isn't isolate. I do want you to know that seeing comments like this have made me feel just a bit better
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel the same way. I'm the same age and everything is so bad. I'm so tired. I can't afford to live, I won't have a house or a stable, well-paying job. It's all gone. Then in like ten years the planet might not be habitable anymore
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m also older Gen Z (just turned 21) and I have similar fears. I’m still currently in disbelief that Donald Trump is going to be my president from my 21st to 25th, and possibly longer.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @atlassample4313 21 is definitely not “older” gen z. You’re middle to young gen z. The oldest gen z is almost 30.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i'm 21, and this is where i am too
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gaze upon your future and weep, friend.  23 is rough, but 43?  😢
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For better or for worse, change is inevitable. I think things are gunna get really bad before things get better. I’m 23 too and the stuff with Luigi has made me a bit more hopeful about good change
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im also older gen z and more than anything Im worried of things never getting better but also getting even worse.   I already accepted I will never have anything even though I work like one day I will.  When a country starts falling and people get more angry usually that leads to a more totalitarian place.  Everyone I know is just holding on hoping for a better future because the present sucks
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @cyonoid I’m the same age as you and I feel all of this so much 🙃
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also 23, also relate. I spent the last 5 years homeless and now have zero hope for humanity as a while
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: me too. im so sorry we're not alone in this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: how could you say this im also gen z and im gonna be 28 in a couple weeks here... how could you... 👵👵
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 😊 No worries. Things are happening.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Jesus, same here; I'm starting to fear stagnation more than I do death.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Elder gen z here (26) doom spiral club represent 🙌
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 26 and I feel like I've been put inside of a pinball machine getting through life. I don't recommend seeking any friendships with men, stick to building friendships with women and stick together. Community is the only thing we will have left.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Older Gen Z is 27, you're middle-younger.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And also...I know it's hard trust me but you will get better as long as you don't let it get to you that you do stupid stuff to your self.   Depressing will lie to you and not let you see the light.  Try to break the bad habit of thinking negative. (I know you said about your mom) I also had a very abusive dad...I felt worthless.  I wasn't happy at home or school.   I felt so drained even after my dad was taken away... eventually I'm like telling myself this is not fair...I deserve to be happy.  I gotta break this.   So i tried to make good habits.   And trust me it works.  U just gotta train yourself to see the bright side
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think that's smack in the middle? 97 is the cutoff i see most
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as a fourteen year old trans girl, I've decided that i'm probably just gonna be miserable for all of my life and that's ok because I can do it for my family
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's what it's like to be 23. You'll eather grow out of it or be one of those weirdos who only hang out with teenagers.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm truly sorry to hear your story... It's very very easy to ignore all the realities others have when you're sitting pretty. But tragedy of random shit can happen to anyone. All I can say is that I truly wish for peace in your life, and that you not give up or give in where your choices can truly improve the quality of your existence.   I sincerely hope that the universe unites you with at least one person that allows you a healing connection, and to know the fulfillment of a silent grateful heart ❤️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Aww stay strong. Hang in there. I try to hold onto my faith that I was born now, in this time, to help see through the transition from the way of life that is dying, and to beckon in the new world. We all have a purpose and it doesn’t have to be big but you are in the right place at the right time, I promise. Hang in there and don’t be afraid to ask for help ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Felt fr, I'm 21 and basically the same thing on my end. I feel exhausted and frustrated in every way and also kinda feel crazy with how impossible it feels and mental health struggles from personal life make it all the harder so I relate on that part as well, It sucks but tbh I'm going to say the thing I feel we're all thinking but not really saying but slightly toned town bc y'know, it's gonna take something crazy to make things change and we're gonna have to be crazy enough to do it ourselves, the trick is to do it as an organization. Solo acts of rebellion are like the first sparks of change, the trick is for the rest of us to do it as a group. Honestly I feel like we'd know what to do better as well if it wasn't just us trying to process everything alone as well. 15 blobs of neurons is better than just 1 🤷‍♂, Also maybe download signal once you do have an org you're a part of, discord chats would probably not be the most secure communication platform to use for anything that isn't being perfectly peaceful and non-confrontational iykwim. The idea of groups allying with other groups to form an even larger cohesive force brings me a slight flicker of hope too, that we can start small, and coalesce with other similar groups to form a large opposition force feels much more manageable imo.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i can be ur friend - things are not all bad madam 👋🏾😲
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah I am with you I am 40 and been dealing with all this same shit my whole life so I am afeelign a bit dejected and broken but still trying top push through on the days I don't think of ending it. I think the worse part is the stupidity of the average American and trying to get them to understand reality and basic ways things work is so fuckling tiring especially when they move the goalpost to protect their opinion/ worldview the second you start breaking through. I wish I had some words of encouragement but my way of dealing with it is a massive fent addiction so I just hope you don't let thee negative overcome you and end up in my boat. Far to often people in our position head straight tto the bottle the pipe the parade of sex partners or whatever vice provides momentary comfort tot he detriment of them and their familys.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Respectfully you gotta wake up or that cycle will continue. You’re grumpy when you’re tired and when you’re grumpy your worst traits show the brightest.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think maybe if you stop focusing on things you can't control that might help. Focus on somthing in your daily life you can actually change & make better, make positive things happen in your daily community. Stop seeing everything as doom & gloom & find anything to be happy about & grateful for. Look at history & all we've accomplished, all the ppl before us who went through tough times & were strong. If they can get through it we can too. If you only see the probelms in life & ignore the good you'll never be happy. Find tiny things yo be happy about thankful for. Choose to be happy & be yourself whoever that is.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think you the youngest gen z..or the middle. My brother 27 and s gen z
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm scared of the world not changing and just being stuck, too
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @cyonoid thanks for this. I feel you. Work sleep shower repeat.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Learning that we aren't going to save a dying world is quite the shocker.  But I've survived with this for 20 years (I'm now 42), so it's not completely hopeless. We just don't know.   Acceptance is a crucial stage of grief, though.  We have to accept that this was the life we got, or it will forever torture us.   I do still hope we can change it, but when you look at the stats, it ain't good.  Nature is dying and we can't survive without it.  We are it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Look on the bright side, you get to watch the world end.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @orterves  that'll definitely solve all our problems i guess
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​@orterves lol so edgy. Good job
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @orterves Not even. Most of us won't be here for "the end of the world" since if we know anything from what's been going on, the burn will be slow and agonizing. I'd argue that talking about the end of the world is just wishful thinking. Things will transform, but not end. I like to think of it like the law of conservation of matter, that mass cannot be created or destroyed. Everything is in a constant state of movement and therefore I would like to think that anything is possible, with time of course. Like the roll of dice, it may take some time to get a certain combination, but it is possible.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 27, 23-24 was the hardest years because you are a baby adult and your frontal cortex is finishing up developing so you have some intense mindset shifts and realizations. The key is to not lose hope which feels impossible at times but having a self soothing routine is essential. For me yoga has saved my life. And deleted ig, snap to focus on myself
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey, I am also older gen z but from brazil 👊 let's chat, I am trying to improve my English knowledge
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Young (44) Xer here - there is no escape.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have people i can talk to and somehow still feel lonely. In my case though, i know i’m terrible socially and only really talk if spoken to. I also feel like nothing will change and feel like my mind can’t be fixed and have often thought about disappearing. Just feels like no matter what i do, nothing changes. None of my ideas work.  i get it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just turned 50. Nobody celebrated with me. It's been 3 years since getting a hug from a friend. Life only gets worse the older you get. Is this isolation from a capitalist system, or just my own inverted apathy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @methonyHolmes-e8p  are you in therapy at all? i'm only 24 and still pretty naive so please take my advice with a grain of salt, but no age is too old to get help and turn things around. it doesn't have to be this way and some people really care
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Excellent thesis for why I’m a teacher
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I became a librarian for similar reasons. I have to do a job, so my job needs to help. Now only if there ere such a thing as being hired in 2024.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah the Gen Z discourse is essentially identical to the one we heard about millennials less than 10 years ago  The only change I’m really seeing is Gen Z becoming MORE politically divided along gender lines  Which is wild when you think about it- we’re in a world where we’ve begun to accept how arbitrary gender roles are  If it’s not already obvious, I’m 33. Firmly in the millennial camp. I’d consider myself left leaning, both economically and socially  So it could totally be my bias talking here, but IMO we’re living through a reactionary era. Of course younger ppl skew left statistically, but I’d say overall there’s been a huge uptake of right wing ideas. They’ve wormed their way into the discourse bc irony became meaningless and humans are simultaneously smart and dumber than hell
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ I'm on the edge somewhere, but I think you're right, the world is VERY reactionary right now. There are probably fewer young people who are on the right, but the do seem to be further right, and I get weird gender attitudes sometimes even from very left people. My non binary sibling who is young gen z acted shocked, and like it meant something about my identity, when I floated a slightly masc nickname. It's strange.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You're gonna be the first lawyer going to heaven in so long! lol <3
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If we all do what we can to make things a tiny bit better and avoid tripping each other up in our efforts to do so, it'll all add up and make it that much easier when there's enough public outrage to make one big push for real change.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think we are about the same age. I am 30. I feel the exact same way. I recently moved to LA where the homelessness is really bad and it made me SO FUCKING MAD, and depressed; depressed to see such suffering. on a daily basis. My best friend worked at a homeless shelter, and I volunteered one day. I have been doing it ever since. I also want to get more involved in climate change. For the first time I felt less crazy - I was with a bunch of other ppl who saw the broken system for what it was. I felt less alone and less sad. Amazing work you will be doing!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ We are the same age! I’m happy to hear you volunteered and got involved. If you want to deepen your involvement, I would research what issue coalitions exist in LA and get involved with those, as well. They’re often the ones working behind the scenes to get local and state laws passed to address problems.   For example, the tenant orgs I’ve worked at so far as a student are all a part of coalitions centered around housing. The most famous one here is probably the Right to Counsel NYC coalition, which successfully made it law that low income tenants have a right to an attorney in eviction proceedings. The organizing and lobbying these local coalitions do can be great catalysts for change.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Love the msg. I think trying to let go of huge overwhelming things we can't control is mentally healthy...while still doing tiny/small things as much as possible yo make ours, animals, the earths & other ppls lives better is where we can focus
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This. And grouping up with others for larger changes.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My boomer parents made sure i grew up in a safe home, which is nice but they didnt prepare me for shit. Im 33 now and just starting to stitch the holes in my life that i kept open for years. My son has a much better life coming to him than i did and thats about the best thing coming.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: they won't teach you but they expect you to learn everything.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh, they have no idea how to fix the mess. That's why they're not teaching you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @lazchurchyard1229  No they know how to fix it. Fixing their mistakes first starts with them relinquishing their own unearned power which politicians and billionaires will never do.  Hell the AI's I've been raising could easily find a significantly better solution than what we are currently dealing with.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: On the bright side when the boomers die , the millennials globally are more connected than ever. We get to tackle the metaproblems even the dinosaurs die
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1. I feel like a lot of them are angry that they’re going to die and think they can stick it to the world by trying to get as much life out as possible. Fair probably would most people would feel if they grew up in their circumstances. 2. I feel like the answer to this problem is just to start new things to fill the gap till the old institutions they run breakdown. That way will be coming into save the day with actual organizational and leadership experience as well as confidence in being able to do our own things.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And asking genuinely for their wisdom and life experience gets ignored or ridiculed like we're born with that knowledge
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeah but at the same time, imagine being 10-15 years away from dying? they have shit going on in their lives, too
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @wilkyb8997  that's not really a fair comparison though, 10-15 years from death, finality, nothing, the void versus a life that has barely began to bloom and can do amazing things in this world?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @wilkyb8997  Yeah imagine knowing you have another 70 years of suffering due to the selfishness of the old and rich.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: victim mindset there’s opportunity for you you just need to accept it will come with struggle they worked for thier shit you gotta do the same
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Don't forget about millenials in that. It's honestly just baffling how the old crumbling and failing structures just keep ignoring anyone who doesn't sing to their regressive tune or conform.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @videocrowsnest5251 millennials are gen y (in between x and z)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it's called Western Nihilism and the only way to defeat it is through Revolutionary Optimism
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm an old Gen Z (26), and I am impressed by these youngsters all the time
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah as a 30 year old millenial watching this it's hard not to despair. The only difference between now and 10 years ago is I thought the boomers were gonna fade away and retire. But now we have geriatrics that refuse to pass the torch.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z are basically the second round of millennials. I've believed for a while that our two generations (millennial and gen z) will be about the least different of modern American generations to have happened. Personal opinion. And I hope generations z figures it out too.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ I just think we’re one generation lol.   A generation is typically 25 years. Traditionally   So I dunno why they changed it all of a sudden.   Boomers are from the 40s to the 60s.  It stands to reason that most Gen z are actually just the youngest millennials.   It sounds odd bc they didn’t experience the turn of the millennium, per se….. but they were being born and raised right through it.  But also, the whole generation thing is so corny.  Up until literally a few years ago I had to explain to people that WE ARE MILLENNIALS.  Other millennials, and older people and sometimes even Gen Z were referring to little kids as “millennials.”  It’s like it took until millennials were in middle age for everyone to agree we are the millennials.   It’s even a joke in a Pete Davidson movie, which I know is such a random reference but since it was a scene with him and his NYC Borough townie friends, it resonated with me.  That’s was just A FEW YEARS AGO. Lmfao.  Like people were legit referring to Gen Aloha as “millennials” like up until a few years ago lmfao.   Also, not everyone is COOL. I know it sounds funny but truly not everyone is hip to their own generation.  I know millennials who are basically boomers. They cannot think for themselves, all their opinions are those of their parents, they only watch movies and tv shows that were popular when they were little kids….   People kind of don’t grow up. And they also don’t have childhoods.   It’s why you can meet a Gen Z acting like the least cool Gen X, and you meet the millennial boomers…  And even BOOMERS are constantly going on and on about the greatest generation, as though everyone is just desperate for their parents validation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Right?   I think it’s so weird how Gen z are literally just millennials.   Like they’re actually not different. At all.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @MsNatiBug  Agreed. I feel like a lot of these things are less about “omg generation [LABEL]”, and more about “This is what being in your 20s feels like in the 21st Century.”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @MsNatiBug  I dunno, the memory of what The Olds did after 9/11 feels pretty significant?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @MsNatiBug  I always saw zoomers as millennials 2.0
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I remember being accused of that as well.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's because millennials were really political and the only "valid" way to do politics today is something that millennials made. This video is really a retread of millennial clichés bcos were still framing being young and caring about politics through millennial narratives that are largely progressive.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm an older millennial and this just sounds like me.  or at least my inner dialogue. I have learned to be more bubbly and less angry in social situations and mostly I learned that to be able to function in the world and get peoples guards down so I can slip in some information about how we should probably flip the table before the planet dies.   The public response around certain smash brother has me feeling pretty hopeful that we might collectively get on the same page. I really want to avoid partisan politics in the coming years and focus on what are the systems that are draining our energy and killing the planet, in what ways we can remove our energy from those systems and the names and addresses of the people who are benefiting from those systems.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: antonio gramsci has a concept of "pessimism of reason, optimism of the will" that i think really applies here
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When feeling powerless, I find it most helpful to brainstorm on how best to utilize the power I do have, and how best to apply all the leverage I can on working to make the change that I can.  Taking care of myself, and my friends and family is a lot better than acomplishing nothing.  Thanks for the great analysis, and weilding the power you have well. Keep educating yourself throughout your life, and sharing what you have learned, and working like water to lift as many boats as you can!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Mia, I'm 67 and can't even count the number of times I hit the wall of hopelessness but survived and tried again.  My biggest piece of advice and a demand ... don't let YT pressure you to change a second of this video.  Don't forget, us boomers are all focused on trying to fix our failing bodies and like you continue to fight for our right to survive on our terms!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an elder millennial (39M), I can confidently say that gen z is just millennial 2.0.   The same stuff, just amplified and compounded over a decade or two.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was apart of the ucla encampment and I was there during the police raid. The spirit of community within the encampment was the most beautiful display of humanity I have ever seen. Everyone looked out for one another. It was beautiful. The police raid was brutal and many of my friends got arrested. It was heartbreaking and my uni just wanted us to continue like nothing happened, like my classmates weren’t beaten (by both police and the counter protesters) and traumatized.

There's a bunch of us. You're more than welcome to join us 💖And if you can't, there are so many ways to stay involved from home!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "fight for our right to survive on our terms"  Okay I get this. I really do. I work in a hospital. Most of our patients are your age. I get it.   Please also recognise that what you are referring to right now is a system of healthcare and an entire array of tools and equipment and and procedures for that medical stuff that is 100% entirely unavoidably dependant on fossil fuels and extremely complicated and advanced global industrial production. This is the exact same stuff that for the younger people like like the rest of us is literally threatening to make our future unlivable. Literally we're approaching the point where human civilisation will collapse and billions will die because of this.   I get your desire for as comfortable and long life as possible. We all feel that we all dread raging the end. But you got to understand that what you're essentially trying to do is sacrifice every future generations lives just to make yours a little bit more comfortable for like 10 more years.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @violetphase  if you bring this argument to the logical conclusion you are saying we should choose who deserves to live or die based on age (scarcity way of thinking which I don’t think works here), this person deserves to live a peaceful life if they can do so. Also, healthcare is not where we should be focusing as a way to curtail fossil fuels as there are much larger producers of pollution than the healthcare industry (such as agriculture, which while has ties to creation of medicines is primarily due to mono-cropping and meat production for nutrition). Another thing to note is a heathy population is less energy intensive, stopping maintenance systems on patients will just worsen the energy drain use and increase suffering.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same for Gen X. It's all been going to ish since at least Reagan in the 1980's.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: sometimes it gets better before it gets worse.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And then you realize that what you were going through the previous year were actually the good times.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm your age. If, in the early '90s, you told me that in the 2020s we'd be back to having tensions with Russia, I'd have said "That would take an egregious amount of evil and stupidity on both sides."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Get off your phone". I'm watching this on my phone... 😢😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Time is a fickle bisexual ghost." --Gen Z Rust Cohle
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Remember, guys: A Bug's Life came out in the 2000s. So did Gen-Z.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Powerlessness is such a fact of life for us. Knowledge was seen as empowerment. But for us, the more we learn the more we realize we alone are powerless to change anything. It feels as though our fate is determined by people who will never see our face or hear our names
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "get off your phone" Me: watching this video on my phone "uhm, no"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Cold America"  As a Canadian, this genuinely cracked me up 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Again, I don’t think Gen Z understands how fucking pertinent and nearly EXACTLY we feel as millennials.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm almost 40 and I feel like a lot of us felt the same way when we were growing up and have watched everything go to sht and I'm always shocked how so many of my generation are just like yeah this is fine.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: One thing I hope that our generation improves on is actually going deeper into topic, and not just passing it off as "not that deep."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For me I think something most of us feel is being super inter-connected to the point that everything is relevant to eachother, yet feeling completely powerless to make a difference in it. It’s like putting a drop into a wave pool, we can’t make a dent in the motions, we can only go through them no matter how negative the consequences
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is the first video I’ve watched of yours and it’s really great! I am a university student studying Environmental Science and your video speaks to the core of why I chose to peruse my careers. I believe the environment is inextricably connected to us as country in terms of our economy, as well as our culture. The environment is also a perfect example of how small adjustments in action can add up to create drastic change. I also believe in exercising every ounce of power we posses to fight the injustices that create this feeling of dispare that you so eloquently describe. You are a voice for our generation and I hope to spread the message of hope which has driven humanity for better or for worse for millions of years. And to all who are reading this, please exercise your agency and get connected to causes in your local area. It is impossible to change anything about everything - so change what YOU can. Take the talents you posses, and transform your reality. Thanks Mia.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Watched one F.D. Signifier video and then from there got linked to a  Mia Cole vid. I'm 47 and I feel the same way about every point you make, loved the video.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Lots of naivety and contradictions but i admire the ambition
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 12:53 George Carlin said “you don’t need an organized conspiracy, when interests converge.” Or something like that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We're not upset that we don't get the same advantages the previous generations got. They actively sold off the future for their own benefit.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im Gen X and an Old Punk, I spent my entire youth protesting and fighting for equality and a better system for us. I have raised 3 Gen Z kids and they are Awsome! I love Gen Z so much, I am so proud of how they don’t take no bull, I am so proud of them for how smart and “woke” they are. It gives me hope.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video is produced sooo well. The editing and audio is amazing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Woah, holy production value! I haven't kept up in a couple years and I almost didn't recognize what i was watching ahahah
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a millennial. I feel you. To many times we are told what others think, to little times do we ask the people themselves what they think. Skip the middle man. It means that the person isn’t being misrepresented by someone who is dehumanizing them. Ty for sharing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i cant tell if you look 18 or 35, and if that isnt the literal embodiment of an overworked and overstressed gen Z person idk what is
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Actually, it came out in 1998 so late 90s.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I graduated high school in 2002...OMG I'm so old...😐
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ChristopherSadlowski  I don’t care
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ah yes, kid's introduction to class consciousness
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And yet it was Antz, its direct competitor, that literally had a protagonist named Z
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bugs life had so much marketing bsck in the day. There were toys in happy meals and spoons in cereal boxes for that movie.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The main difference is that Gen Z has seen one planet that has always sucked, while millennials have seen 10-15 different planets since 9/11 that each got worse.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @tomlinn1990  so true. Since the early 1990s I’ve seen several world paradigms that have each gotten more and more dystopian and horrifying.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think a great way to use this energy is to try to bring Millenials and Gen Z closer to form a more cohesive group. Idk what kind of name or image it'd have but in general the more allies we bring together the better I think
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I thought it was rather odd and extremely telling that the professor included stats of American pride for Boomers (55+), skipped Gen X and most Millennials entirely, and resumed with stats for Gen Z and below. (Around 39:00, for reference.)   If the numbers remain similar to the 2013 Pew Research poll, Millennials feeling pride for America number around ~38%, but I guess showing a consistent decline of patriotism is less striking than a hard drop.   But yeah, as a Millennial, I couldn't differentiate my overall opinions on the state of the country and the world at large from this gal's. And at least among my peers, in a red city in a blue state, these sentiments are an almost unspoken norm.  I'm sure there are some think pieces written by salty Millennials complaining about Gen Z, but I find we're more likely to agree with them than we are to disparage them. The only thing I think we could comment on with worry about younger generations is the rise of misogyny among boys, some still aged in the single digits, due in large part to the rise of the "manosphere" and incels and Andrew Tate.... But I also worry about this in Millennial men, too, so ... I don't know if that's to be blamed on generations rather than a deeply bigoted society more broadly.  We're all in the same boat, and we're all sinking. Because the ocean is rising due to unmitigated man-made climate change. So we're all gonna drown together.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Prizzlesticks It's concerning now seeing Andrew Tate in the UK started a new political party
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What abt gen x ? Like our parents
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @MarvelousMars  X skews too conservative and wealthy relative to (white) Millennials and Z. Exceptions exist, natch.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And, if boomers think back, this is how their parents talked about them. And how the Silent Generation was dismissed.  Maybe, just maybe, we stop hazing the next generation?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @AR-vk7gg It makes me sad seeing gen z fighting with gen alpha already
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Am I having a stroke? I can't read this. "Millennials feel pertinent and exactly." is how I read this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ “Millennials feel that this is just as pertinent to them. We share the same concerns as Gen Z. Gen Z may feel like they are on an island alone with these feelings, but trust me, millennials has been saying this shit for a long time.”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 39, too, and the only difference is that millennials saw the fall, and Gen z were born in the landing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @rustyscrapper  I don’t think so. It’s not fine for me. And we’re the same age ish..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @rustyscrapper  I’m embarrassed by my generation, tbh..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeah i think many from our generation would agree that things got noticeably worse after 9/11, a  lot of the optimism we had was lost. the 90's were a golden age most remember fondly  compared to anything that has come after them
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m almost 35. Most people around our ages aren’t too bright, there’s that. Also..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @srealone788  going through life with a name like Braxtynn or Sayer or Braydon can’t be good on someone’s empathy levels, either
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm also an ENV SCI major. I hate seeing careless waste and pollution. (Dont get me started on russia). BS solutions that don't do much to fix the ingrained issues anger me even more. Personally tho, I am optimistic for the future because the world is always changing, and opinions of the masses change too!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @faux3924  russia, china and india, take care of those 3 and like 60% of pollution is gone
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Youre studing environmental science? For what? To become a professional homeless person?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah dude what good would studying the environment do, it's not like that's the thing that humans inextricably live within and base their entire existence off of, we uh, we uhhhhhhhh materialize food from the aether and have giant air conditioners in the sky making us comfortable!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We are reaching unprecedented levels of BACK
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial dad here who some would consider a big scary red word…I loved this video. It brings me hope that Gen Z is smarter than my generation as a whole, to the point that politics are being discussed among a younger demographic than previously.   To put it into perspective a bit more, when I was cutting class in high school it was the turn of 2000…and nobody cared about politics, in fact talking about them made you a turbo dork (me). So because of that, so many of my class mates signed up to fight because….rhymes with fine-11…none I knew came back sadly.   The generation fighting stuff has always been an additional tactic in dividing the working class, folks who trade their labor (life hours) for cash.  Anyways, I’m rambling, subscribed!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1:04:00 “cuz this country- it makes you feel crazy, that seemingly nobody else [cares about 🍉]”  holy shit. i feel this. i feel this hard. i live pretty close to dc, in a liberal area, and yet it’s also SUCH a zionist area. i have one friend who i KNOW shares my opinions, and the rest are just. painfully neutral. and then i have two “friends” who actually are zionists, and it drives me crazy how they can say some fucking racist shit and not even realize it. it drives me crazy how i’ll be looked at as some sort of monster if i even DARE call them something so horrible like “racist”, while they’re casually implying that arab children’s lives don’t matter. it feels like the only way i can get people to see my beliefs as reasonable is to say that i’m middle eastern and bosnian, and i don’t want to talk about my family history with genocide just to be able to say that it’s bad.  i think the only time i truly felt like my opinions were heard was when i went to a protest earlier this year. sure, people online can agree with me, but it’s so much better to be able to feel and surround yourself in the solidarity of others  free palestine 🇵🇸
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I listened to this with the screen in my pocket, every time you cited malm I heard “mom said…”

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable." -some guy who was shawt in the head
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: well this sure was a way to end my work week cripes. This is definitely going into my subconscious to percolate. That love/hopelessness bit at the end was brutal, every time you did the swap I had just started going "yeah I get this" to the previous point. Goddamn.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Damn is the Quinn’s Ideas theme song just a stock sample? She used it alot in this video. I thought it was a unique thing haha
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 9:11 <— literally when it all hit me. A thought occurred to me recently when I was talking to my parents about why they don’t need to have a heart attack when they find out I joined a local DSA chapter. Even if the current system does somehow magically work the best and America truly is the beacon of morality, that’s a system that is fundamentally contrary to who I am. It’s contrary to how I see humans, my parents are some of the most charitable people I know but they blow the same tune of acting as if humans didn’t have a gun to their head they’d murder, plunder, and fall into all matter of hedonism.   I really don’t want to believe nor live in the world my parents tell me exists, one that is unchanging and has already been perfected. If this is the world and the only way it can be, to me, it sullies the purpose of life. Because at the end of the day most of us will loose a quarter of our life working to feed the months that starve us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Here from FD signifier. Glad to have made your acquaintance
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an older millennial, who entered the workforce IN 2008, went through our period of being the scapegoat "youth" by "killing the [insert industry] industry" and having to grow into a new, digital age with new rules and new ways of sharing/receiving information, trying to figure out how we can still get the "dream" our society promised...  It's interesting seeing the next generation go through this with new crises -- built off what we left behind, from what we could cobble together from what previous generations left behind. I think Gen Z sees the writing on the walls Millennials got stuck in and decided that the Obama-era "Hope"TM and "Change"TM and "respectability" we tried to make ourselves believe in/practice wasn't enough to get everyone closer to the "dream." I think Gen Z decided to act more directly and not rely on faith in the system (and probably largely from watching us fall into it's traps and pitfalls).  I also feel like the Boomers and elder Gen X can't appreciate the cycles and spirals and how they reflect their own lived experience. And not being able to appreciate those similarities and how your perspectives "intersect and leave each other" (as I think you said at the beginning) is a lot of what blocks progress (or even survival) for those who come after.  And after enough progress gets blocked for enough generations that something's gotta give.  I wonder sometimes if my generation was a transition, your generation is a catalyst, and maybe Gen Alpha was portentiously named because some new way of doing things will emerge.   We'll have to (get through this mess and) see, I guess.  (Anyway now to act 3 and finishing the video.)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Me when the democracy is oligarchy shaped or something idk
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "War is online Now" Is a whole top in in itself. There is very rarely a good enough reason to let a conflict spill out like that ever again
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 15:27 I'm part of Gen Z (2000) and growing up I was never really popular or "social" and by the time I turned 11 I would learn what depression feels like which would put me in an existential crisis that would follow me all throughout my life.   By the time I turned 16 was when Trump was having issues with North Korea which led to fears of ww3 and that is what led me down a rabbit hole of studying this country. It would not only snap me out of my existential crisis but it would spark an interest to learn language and international politics.  I would teach myself Mandarin Chinese and Japanese (not Fluent) as well as several other languages (but not to the level of basic reading).   The main problem with how they handled that meeting with the ceo was that America has Diplomatic Relations with Singapore (One of the only few predominantly English speaking countries in Asia). They could've asked the Singaporean government if they had any information on him.   What makes this more interesting is that prior to Tiktok's creation there was an Opera singer by the name of Leandra Ramm that was stalked by a man from Singapore. He would send her all kinds of messages and would threaten her and her family for years.  Her story would appear on the show Obsession: Dark Desires Season 1 Episode 5: Number One Fan
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The nice thing about this video is that in 10 years you'll be able to ask an AI to replace any mention of Gen Z with Gen Alpha and it will work just fine. Because this is a young person thing. Not a generation thing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Elder millennial leftist, thank you for your service.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You know I recon if I can ever just make a yt video with the same quality and comedy as a mia cole video. I’ll be happy. I fucking love you videos
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a millennial and I'm totally and utterly disengaged from politics, you couldn't pay me to care at this point. Waking up the next day is an accomplishment for me at this point.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a millennial mom. With a final cusp Gen Z 13 year old and three Gen Alpha. They are a lot smarter kids than they are given credit. Honestly. Some of their peers in school struggle more. But my kids are actually impressively bright.  I feel like tools such as smart phones and the internet and widespread immediate access to all this information, can be a useful tool for them in a way? To learn more, a lot sooner than any of us ever could. Since we didn’t grow up with any of this. I’ve been saying that I feel like I’m learning just as fast 💨 now, alongside my children. Which blows my mind sometimes. Sometimes I feel like even my 8 year old is learning things as fast as I am. And I’m Almost 35..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Most people in our age generations aren’t too bright. It’s embarrassing and I’ve given up on even trying to explain anyone my age like I’m sorry, guys. Idk. 🤦🏻‍♀️☠️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeah i feel gen z are a lot more aware at a younger age than we were just cause the internet has progressed to the point where so much of this information is available to a pervasive degree, they have grown up with that where as when i was a teenager all i had was pretty much myspace and youtube was mainly for fun , hardly a good resource for anything
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Damn man, middle eastern AND bosnian, and I thought my spawn sucked. At least you managed to get out of the balkans, congrats dude, keep holding on.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: thanks man, keep holding on yourself <3
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the.. 13th waffen of Palestine and Haj Amin al Hussein? yeah it does seem no one cares about when they sent thousands of jewish kids each month to the Arbe death camp..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: that word has drowned in its own cringe by now. unity far less so
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 🤘🤘🤘 as a fellow millennial yes!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is deeply felt. My family is relatively progressive, but as an older generation they have an unwavering loyalty and belief that the system has people's best interests in mind despite the insanity going on around us.    They're completely resigned to the system and all its problems just being the best we can do, and  "being really chill about it" as Mia puts it is the only way improvement happens over time, when that's historically never been the case. Gen Z is constantly portrayed from their end as entitled and overly emotional for not just accepting the status quo and living conditions that are becoming more abusive to everyone year after year.    Its incredibly frustrating how expressing any kind of anger about war crimes or class injustices is flipped as young people going too far or being unreasonable , while the govt is quietly making it impossible for us to make any real change the "right way". If your family's only exposure to reality is mainstream news, regardless of how progressive the network portrays itself, they just won't see it as anything more. I can't help but feel like that constant disingenuous read on our behavior older generations get fed to keep them distracted with culture war crap contributes to the powerlessness and desperation to do something meaningful we all feel.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So you're saying 9:11 was your 9/11?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jingbot1071  It all hit him then
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Got gen X older siblings. And they received extra guilt shaming about not being successful from the Boomers than the millennials did. And had to wait even longer for opportunities to open up (the current Boomer retirement wave).  Pretty difficult to comprehend a life where you could easily be a high school dropout and a homeowner, multiple cars, own a boat, vacations every year and having a family of four with a single income with a pension. I remember telling my friends growing up about this lifestyle my parents witnessed (friends whose parents immigrated from other countries in the 80s & 90s). They thought I was lying. Because nowhere in the world at any point in history was something like that possible for the majority of people (outside Western Europe)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If it helps you feel.... not alone... I'm a millennial, It's been wild watching the world transform from a pre-internet pre-9/11 world into what it's become.  Seeing so much come and go in such a short period of time, watching everything transform and not knowing which direction it REALLY is going... the apathy and despair is real.  Witnessing a system which seems to refuse to improve is on the one hand extremely disheartening, but intriguing to watch how the deep manipulations stop actual progress for the many to benefit the few.  I marched and participated in protests against the slaughter of civilians in the Iraq war, and the odd islamophobia that became so much more real than I would have ever imagined here in the US, and I lost friends over seas because of it.  I watched the systematic derailment of the occupy wall street movement after the government dug us all into further debt to protect private companies and rich citizens who were gambling with lives and ruined the housing and retirement markets. A life is a wild thing to experience, and we're all in this together, but there's such huge value in making the sort of video that you have.  Speaking about what you see and experience, acknowledging it, and voicing ones opinion like you have in such an eloquent and well researched way helps, others to not be gaslit by those who simply don't want to acknowledge the reality or allow for us to progressively evolve.  Especially in the increasingly segmented and disassociated world we find ourselves in, where algorithms based on engagement/clicks/advertising are continually prioritized, all which push us further into deeper and deeper echo-chambers.  I don't know if the shock of witnessing it all ever really wares off, I know that the disassociation and apathy certainly kicks in, but either way, you're not alone, and your awareness will allow you to be supportive and helpful for the generations after you.  Alpha is going to need people who paid attention to help show them answers and give them support.  Also you will never regret having taken the time to do this, or to be able to look back and be proud of how much you cared.  Keep up the great work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The idea that war has never been so visible is wild. Ukraine and Syria?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i love the way your bangs bob as you speak. it is truly mesmerising. great vid as always
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This made good backgorund noise for 3AM breakfasts
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Omggggg as a millennial hearing “I’m 20” and “it’s so over” I died a little
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was pretty active as a college student in the 2000s during the Iraq Afghanistan stuff.  What I had to learn is that these issues aren't always the Good-Evil dichotomy that would've made it easy.  The problem is that the Good Guys aren't all on the same side.  It's not just that we disagree on what the facts of a situation are.  We also disagree on how we prioritize those facts, and we disagree on what-leads-to-what.  So many people whose views we consider awful can actually be intelligent, well-informed people of good conscience.  The thing we hate, they think will actually solve a problem.  And it's all speculative because, due to the Laws of Unintended Consequences, we disagree on what will lead to what.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Maybe protests don't heal physical wounds, but they sure af fight gaslighting. Having to fight to survive, and seeing that others all the way across the globe are rooting for you, I can see how maybe it seems meaningless to some, but another part of me  would feel so emboldened because I'd know I'm not crazy. When suffering crosses language and culture barriers, it's hard to deny its reality.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Welcome back, Mia. Thank you for all of your hard work on this one
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The love and hopelessness part reminded me of ''is it Wickedness or Weakness'' for some reason
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nearly 40 and it really does feel like I lived in two completely different worlds.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: From an old gen Xer:  YOU ARE KILLIN IT!! Keep it up, your energy is needed if we're going to survive all of this.... Love, Love and more love to you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m firmly mid-millennial and was just at a very leftist healthcare conference. I met about 5 other people who were mid-career. Everyone else was either a retiree or a student. On one hand I was so impressed by these young women I talked to who were so much more aware and engaged than I was at their age. On the other hand I was so depressed that people in mid-life lose so much momentum, or are so bogged down with job, kids, and life concerns that they don’t have the time, energy, or inclination to participate in politics. This is why we can’t keep saying the youth will save us. Life works so hard to make sure that by the time the youth have political power their will has just been gutted. It’s the hippie to boomer pipeline
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Watching you grapple with this topic through every different emotional state, historical event, and state of mind was amazing. It felt wrong to have watched for free
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 37 years old getting schooled on hope by a 19 year old. Bawling my eyes out.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the fact that you are afraid of saying some stuff because of recent events disturbs
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well I’m 45 and I needed this bad. Thank you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 18:50 You just casually shattered this man's whole world, and for what? A cutaway gag?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z sees one planet that has always sucked. Millennials have seen 10-15 different planets since 9/11, and they have each gotten lamer and more conservative and more inhuman.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m……. 20. It’s….. it’s…..it’s not over
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Something I've noticed is that as a kid, Gen z would get lumped in with millennials, and now, we get lumped in with Gen Alpha. Idk if it's just older generations being purposely obtuse or if we're just THAT insignificant. Like, we're gonna be the new gen x or something lmfao.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Can you share any more about this conference? I’m close to finishing my MD (in the EU) and my dream occupation is doing leftist healthcare in some capacity. I’ve become more and more of an anarchist and the thought of getting into the existing healthcare industry feels counterproductive at this point in time
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Amazing that is a huge accomplishment! Medicine is one of those occupations that is somewhat institutional by necessity just due to the degree of oversight needed for training and safety. But that feeling of helplessness when that institution is keeping you from helping someone properly is so painful. The org I’m involved with is working on getting national health care in the US specifically, so not particularly applicable to your case. I have heard of doctors vastly scaling back their paid work hours to give free care to underserved populations, or traveling to serve refugee communities. There is also a ton of really important public health work and research being done. I would see if your professional organization or medical board has a social justice interest group, or you can start one at your school. Getting involved with medical workers unions may also be a good starting place. Congratulations and so much luck!!

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Throw in the few minor short times when we thought things were starting to change for the good
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: more conservative? when? in the last 8 years? whats that like 16 years of progressivism?  I would consider judging people by their race inhuman, not when a person actually reads qualifications equally
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is brilliant. Thank you. I'm currently raising a 15 year old GenZer. He's definitely more politically engaged than I ever was in my youth. ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 30:30 heard this as "deep dish trust" and I'm saddened to learn it's not.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Definitely has the ✨gen z vibes✨  Great video, Mia! As a 22 year old gen Z person involved directly in my county and state politics, I can honestly say, this is a fantastic analysis of all of the characteristics that make our generation unique. Especially our compassion and drive to change the world for the better.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think it’s ultimately quite simple. The current technological and social  state of affairs creates an antisocial distance that prevents us from actually benefitting from one another’s presences. We encounter each other, often, merely as mundane objects filling space.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1:01:25 As a reality check, she lost due to global inflation trends and post covid economic malaise. This happened world wide, and basically every single incumbent party across the globe lost reelection last year. Eggs and gas got expensive so people voted in the fascist. That's basically it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Luigi was a right winger that did what we would think as left-wing violence. Just like the two right-wingers that tried to assassinate Trump.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hope this video gets one billion views bro
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: babe just please be safe and well <3
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video is rad as fuck I’m gonna watch everything you got
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z is more class conscious and less ableist than any generation prior in my lifetime.  I hate the Gen Z hate, love this video.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a millennial I experienced everything you are describing all throughout my 20s. The Afghanistan/Iraq war, the healthcare hunger games, the impending climate disaster, racism, patriarchy, and the evils of capitalism (remember the Occupy Movement?) were all very clear and present dangers to us and we were incredibly vocal and active about it and simultaneously maligned and repressed for it. Then the moment y'all became voting age they just kept writing the same stupid articles but changed it from Millennial to Gen Z. You aren't alone, but sadly the gerontocracy has all the power and refuses to pass away.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: just commenting this before i forget when i finish the video but like...as an older gen z-sorta-millenial (and speaking generally to anyone), please do NOT get your information solely through tiktok. it's good to spread awareness but do not let that be your end source of information nor let it inform your biases. you guys don't have enough media literacy to understand when you are being lied to or if you are regurgitating false information just because it "sounds" progressive.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: An ABSOLUTELY terrific video. I really enjoy the exploration of the "information super highwayion influencing the ideology and news you come to believe, giving incredible power to actors on beliefs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “one of the good ones lol” gave me a legit belly laugh.  Thanks for that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: More and more I think about a line I saw in kill six billion demons: "Reach heaven through violence."

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I mean she also ran an abysmal campaign, give her some credit. Somehow she thought she could be conservative better than her opponent.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @glowerworm well she was given a limited time so definitely terrible campaign
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "fascist"  looks inside: the left wants to.. arrest the opposition and consolidate more power to the goverment they deemed too corrupt..   yeah idk, but I dont think Hitler was a male lesbian with a wife of a different race
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Shoutout for the Kim Crenshaw reference, Intersectionality is the glue that binds modern human rights discourse
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: girl read marx please just read marx girl please thanks
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Whew. I feel ya kid. I was your age when the towers came down and I've been feeling that occilation between hope and despair ever since.  Theres only two true and useful things I've heard about dealing with that cycle.  1. Action is the antidote to despair. The only way I've ever known to crawl out of hopelessness is to put on my shoes and try to fix at least one thing.  2. Dont forget to take breaks. Protest movements and radical activism demand a lot of everything from us. Its important to step away from time to time to allow yourself to rest and recover. You're no good to anyone if you burn yourself out. Its literally the opposite of selfish to take care of yourself.   As far as what to do, that's a lot harder to figure out. If I knew the one weird trick to dismantle capitalism and save the world,  would have done it 20 years ago.  The only path that makes sense to me these days is collective mutual aid. If we can figure out how to meet each other's needs without a trip to Walmart, then thats at least a little bit of power we've taken back from the intertwined economic/political structure in a way thats scaleable, positive, and immediate.  Edit: BTW yall can do whatever you'd like with Eminem. I've never liked that guy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It makes me very sad that all 17- and 18-year-olds know about our politics is how it's been for the past decade. This NOT normal.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: GW student here so wild to see my school in the wild. That encampment was the most I felt like there was a community at that school.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its like watching a documentary 😍
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: thank you. Genuinely its so relieving to not only hear the great despair of everything, but that im not alone in feeling so tired and yet being able to do something about it. Idk, its very welcomed and appreciated
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: close enough welcome back kate bush
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So I'm a 37 year old Transgender woman probably not your target audience but I get exactly what your talking about 100% what your describing is the politics of begin disempowered and marginalized. And yes those of us who've seen this behaviour from the ultra-rich over many decades are well aware of their machinations and yes they work hard to erase any mainstream media coverage or space where we can organize away from their gaze. Sadly things haven't really improved much even in my much longer living memory.  Just to let you know I know you might feel alone as alot of Gen Z probably do but yours is a story that actually makes up the majority of people that is systemically silenced.  Thank you for making a video that iterates this point clearly you clearly put alot of passion into it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 2:00 not wasted but stoned does that still count
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gods, it feels like everything has been pushing a tipping point further and further and further until it eventually doesn't blow up, but they somehow manage to push it a little bit further.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an Elder Millenial, my number one rule is that we ALWAYS support young people. Because NONE of OUR elders supported us. Yall need better than we had.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also, as a Palestinian-American, i am completely in awe of the support from Gen Z & i thank you all for your solidarity. If there's 1 thing you all have proven to the establishment, it's that they should be completely & utterly ashamed of their complicity in this genocide in Gaza. Growing up witnessing the horrors & atrocities inflicted upon my own family & friends in Palestine while my own country's taxes fund this oppression, ive always felt hopeless about the sutuation. But Gen Z has proven to me that Americans havent lost all their humanity quite yet. Keep fighting the good fight! End Israeli apartheid & free Palestine, from the river to the sea!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The sad ant with the bag on a stick really is the face of a generation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 28 and my fiancée and I decided we would adopt instead of bringing a child into the world because we felt the world would only get worse, no matter what action we do or don’t take. I’m empathetic for others, and want to see everyone do well, but I can’t keep my family safe and also say what I want or protest against the powers that be. I truly hope the world gets better, even if it has to get worse first, for my family, and everyone else.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Whereas everyone else thinks the world started with Ronald Reagan...

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: He's INNOCENT I was with him at the time playing Mario Kart in Florida
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'll reply again once I finish the video. As a xennial, I've worked with y'all since you were kids. The criticisms are misunderstandings. Y'all will change the world. I see it. Got my gripes, but overall you're on track
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1:01:01-1:03:45 not a fan of this part of the video. not wrong, but it kind of doesn't matter. i'm 2/3 of the way into this video and like... its utterly insane that the media narrative is that gen z is far left. thats a big argument of the whole video, but its difficult to underscore how horrendously objectively incorrect this is. very few people are talking about this: gen z elected donald trump this year. still voted for harris overall, but by a MUCH SMALLER margin. this is the furthest right a young generation has voted for a verrrrrrry long time - AND!!!!! WE DIDN'T HAVE A LOW TURNOUT!!! THIS WAS THE MOST RIGHT-WING YOUTH VOTE SINCE BUSH-GORE! winning any election in the us in the future will require an understanding of how and why exactly this dramatic shift occurred. it concerns me down to the deepest part of my soul that nobody has been talking about this  edit: finished the video, 1:18:38 is wrong in a very important way; incels are not like doomers in any way. incels are a SUBSET of doomerism, definitionally. gen z have incels. matter of fact, does anyone have precise statistics as to how many incels are millennials vs gen z? of course not, but that lack of knowledge is genuinely disconcerting. we have to figure out ways to navigate a modern space that isn't self-reporting; that you can't poll, that has "become ungovernable." its difficult, but what we ought to do is engage with these kinds of spaces we have "cancelled" or consider defunct. to a not necessarily insignificant extent, we have to put ourselves in triggering or potentially triggering places, communities, events,  spaces, &c. to have a chance at shifting the wider culture to be more tolerant and considerate. anyway my deepest concern remains unaddressed. kind of unrelated 2 the video itself actually but im so fucking tired that NOBODY is talking about this. anyway. hi
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z simply learned the truth faster than millennials because of this increased access to knowledge.  A few of us knew this 20 years ago but no one was listening when we tried to stop this crazy match towards extinction.   The Demise of humanity wasn't yet understood, which made it even more depressing. At least for you young people, there's some potential solidarity in knowing you're in this together.   My generation (yes, flawed category) never got it that we weren't making progress but were in fact on the tail end of a crash.   We could have woken up and been like you, but we instead took the blue pill.   Climate change is only one of many crises that we've inflicted on ourselves and failed to recognize in any reasonable time.   I hope you all help us wake up!  Even if we can't fix things, at least we can be honest and have compassion
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Conflict adverse and argumentative has a name.  Passive aggressiveness.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this isn't a video essay anymore, this is a political DISSERTATION
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bernie was the hero we needed, but not the one we deserved
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its amazing to experience the first ten minutes of your video as a Millenial. I feel about 80% of what you said is a carbon copy of the beats and feelings ans labeling we went through. Especially hearing the "snowflake" and "parrticipation trophy generation". That was the whole s**t we were given. I think our generations are the least different two generations in modern american culture, as far as i am concerned. I think our age groups need to work together from now on to make sure Gen Alpha is okay and that we can build a very different future going forward than what we inhereted.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think a lot of the dating issues stem from women having broken out of their gender roles but men being unable to do the same.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My 2004 sibling is actually turning 21 this year. Partying soon at the end of January!

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 50:25 free palestine from hamas
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 18:35 economics will always be the most important thing and that's a great thing as long as people understand what is economics. Unfortunately to this day people missunderstand economics as just finance, economics is the science of studying and trying to predict the reaction to the demand of something in scarcity. Things like social justice, things like inequality etc are currently things in scarcity, everyone fights for their access and their share on these goods. Especially this year the biggest fight of all during the elections was for obtaining the justice system. Once you start seeing things like that, politics start making sense and the holes in the system are clearer and easier to publicly adress them. Which is what we currently lack and what leads to distrust to the establishment.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a young Millennial (30), I am not made hopeful by seeing the hope in the new youth movement.   Young people said the same thing 10 years ago. I’ve seen videos of young people saying the same thing 50 years ago: “We are the future, we will fix it.”   “Young people” never do. The young fighters age into the old fighters, the youth movements don’t stop, they just age.   Meanwhile, conservatives and liberals don’t spawn at the age of 35, they start out that way, when they are young. They are born in power and they keep it.   Young people, those before me, myself, and those after me, seem to come out imagining a united front that does not exist. There are the liberator and the uninvolved. The youth are a fictitious block.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Your aesthics/ look/ type is very attractive to me and I have no idea why
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As much as this hurts to watch without the ability to ask followup questions or correct certain errors, it was very informative.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @22, If I don't invest every spare dime I have into the market, there will be no feasible financial future for me.  Yeah there are certain fields hiring, but most are corporate, and the ones that aren't demand extensive backbreaking and soul sucking labor.  Six years from now there will be fewer sources of income than people globally...  Unless moving to an undeveloped country sounds nice.  My grandparents sit in their fully paid off house with three cars and tell me "renting is nice" as an alternative to owning a house.  I DON'T WANT TO RENT, BUT I WILL NEVER HAVE A CHOICE WITHOUT SELLING MY SOUL!!!  We were supposed to be at peace by now, a hundred years ahead from where we are now.  Our forefathers failed us by voting for all the crooks that led us here.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Man where are you guys finding all these left wing spaces of shared gen z frustration. All im seeing is 20 somethings being unironic nat socs because their date thought their immigrant "jokes" were fucked up 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why is the editing so good?!???? Like why is this better than the majority of feature films and other video documentaries
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yikes, I can't understand this video because I don't have attention deficit disorder 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly, as an older gen Z (22), I've just kind of given up at this point. I've accepted the fact that the world is shit, and will always be shit, and that any attempt to change that is just empty posturing to make oneself feel better. I was promised a world, a life, and all I will ever be able to do is sit and rot in my parents' house or starve to death on the street. This world wasn't made for me, or any of my peers. It's the endpoint of a culture imploding on itself, as the new mass extinction unfolds and catastrophic climate change creeps further and further every year - and by the time any of that changes, by the time things get livable again, I'll be long dead. I really, truly admire people who strive to push forward, who force themselves to have hope no matter what and take on the suicidal fight to survive, but that's not me. I don't really care if it sounds edgy at this point - I didn't ask to be born, I didn't want this dead-end life, and I don't see a reason to care about it until someone gives me something worth caring about.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What are your gripes? I'd love to hear feedback on how we can improve 😊
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The reason why is exactly what this video is about. Hopelessness. When a large swathe of the population feels hopeless, and sees no future for the world, they latch onto any way forward they can. For a large part of gen z that is left leaning politics. This also means a large portion is seeking answers in conservative talking points.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The amount of Gen Z that just didn't vote absolutely dwarfs those who voted for Donald.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's important to note that Harris ran a truly awful campaign in which she agreed with huge chunks of the Republican platform, such as claiming that we needed to do something about the border, putting Republicans in cabinet positions, giving full support to Israel, being uncritically in support of police officers, etc. She also came out of Biden's shadow, whose mental problems and age marred the Democratic party, allied with Liz Cheney, snubbed many Palestinian leaders, didn't even try to campaign in several battleground states, etc. Democrats also sit on their thumbs waiting for things to magically get better without actually doing anything about it. The parties mainly differ in how they feel about gay people and whether they can actually implement policies they want.  All in all, this was a choice between a lackluster center right party and a far right party. Taking the results of this election as indications of political beliefs is absurd.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @josephmellor7641 It depends on who you are talking about, but in Trump's case he has actually been the most pro gay president we've had in a long time. Just compare his record with Obama's or Biden. He supported it long before they did, and still does.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeah this video is great in many ways but much of it felt too anecdotal, which, ironically, is indicative of the self-centered experience of culture through one’s curated social media landscape she mentions at the start of the video. people, politically, are more diverse than they’ve ever been. to generalize anyone or anything anymore seems to me inherently stupid
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: she stated she’s not a scholar multiple times and that info might not be accurate..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thinking of what mistakes we made in Occupy which was when many of us were the same age she is now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ammarhusain6235  exactly. Or protesting the invasion of the middle east after 9-11. Or my parents protesting Vietnam.   But yeah, we need to work together. We need to find a more effective way of turning these economic/political monsters which rule us and completely bog down human progression and equity on its head. Change it all. We've always had an effectiveness issue.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hi. I live in the NLs, not in the USA. I feel like the gender role issues are less pronounced here. At this point the most fervent stuff I see is the stuff that came from the internet first.  I'd say focus on treating everyone like humans. No stuff like "you have to be a good man or woman" but say "you have to be a good human".  This takes away the conversation's focus on the gender roles and whether or not they should be important and adhered to, and shifts it to a place where it is not important nor policed. And it can highlight any double standards in how we ask men vs women to behave. It demands that we see good behaviour through the lense of whether it would be good if anyone did it.  By saying that men are categorically the bad guys, you already cede territory to the importance of gender. But the goal was equality,... that gender is not important. Eyes on the ball: Focus on standards that any human should follow.  Everyone should approach in dating. Everyone should communicate their desires maturely, for both yesses and nos. Either everyone sometimes pays for dates, or you share the bill. etc etc  And to all men: if you feel bad about the standards you have to live by: revolt. Simly revolt. You don't need to simply complain and take it out on feminism as if that is a movement only for women, to the point you undermine the gender equality goal of that movement, while harkening back to conservative gender norms as if that will help you. Was feminism not supposed to be a movement for gender equality actually? There have been waves of feminism that bickered with each other because the challenge of gender equality changed. Maybe take that monniker of feminism and demand that the movement should care about this as well, and maybe become a new, sixth wave. Or whatever you want: revolt. Demand society to treat you as equals, too. Demand society to change like the feminists did. You don't have to go around and complain all day. Change your society instead.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im a pretty feminine guy and its really hard. i have to intentionally "fit" social expectations, otherwise its "weird". For example, I don't paint my nails, though I would like to.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's those very wоmеn who are stopping them.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ffwast you’re a joke if you think that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The problem is that while a lot of old masculine standards have been ripped down (and a lot of them deserved to go), they've not really been replaced with anything. There's a tremendous sense of female unity and common cause, even in it's most commercialised form, whereas men...are there. Nobody's really sure what's good about being a man any more, and the message, insofar as there is one, is that men should collectively pay penance for their privilege, even if an individual man's life sucked and he hasn't felt privileged for one single moment of it. And nobody on the left seems to know what to do with them other than "sit over there, stay out the way and if you ever feel attacked or undervalued for your gender, then suck it up, women are due some vengeance for what other men did to them". There's no positive new model of what being a man actually is. So reactionary grifters move in to that gap in the market.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @paulgibbon5991  finally a (I think a leftist?) I can agree with in these comments.   tbh people should (but dont have to) learn that anything is possible as long as its realistic, and that everything could be true to some degree, cause "truth" is a human concept, how we see things is different, influnece could be manipulation or the other way around. our own people, fellow citizens should be the last ones to be attacked, the issue is upstairs, if there will be a collapse we should hurry to the amish or something and work on the farm.  essentialy ideological agnosticism, not quite omnism
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @unturned6066  if you keep bullying them every time they do much as take even one step outside of those boundaries
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this!! justice oriented gen-z and my life's pursuit is in understanding economics to understand the political situation. change happens with people; economics, in context with other social sciences is effectively a study of power.    it is incredibly illuminating. but it must function almost as a system of thinking - "economics youtube" does not provide this. we must have more critical thinkers create and disseminate their knowledge - not guys obsessed with predicting the dollar
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Maybe that should be the threat in a world with a shrinking population. "If you don't listen to us, and make the world a better place, we'll move to [Ukraine/Uganda/Uruguay/insert country] where they will."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think this is the exact mindset that is very prevalent in young people and also very harmful. It’s good to acknowledge the problems and injustices in the world and how there is a lack of power and a voice for young people, however, we can’t just accept the fact that the world is this way. It truly is an awful situation, but having nihilism and apathy towards it won’t make things better.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You know, we all have to make our own choices, and I have, at times, made choices that would have me saying things similar to what you're saying.   As I made more choices and collected the consequences of those choices, good and bad alike, I realized that in my insistence that I saw things for the way they really were, I had put blinders on and was choosing to ignore the always changing facts on the ground. I shut myself off to the fact that I might not be alone in this because everyone I had tried to convince wrote me off or shrugged at the ideas I considered to be compelling enough that they actually constituted a reason to fight in and of themselves.  I wasn't alone, though, and neither are you. Who knows if we can actually prevent the worst of the outcomes. Who knows if we can prevent any of the bad outcomes. We're all going to go through that experience together no matter what we do, so we might as well fight for it to not be as bad as it could be for as many of us as possible.   I think life sucks, too. I've experienced a lot of pain in my life, the kind of pain that people get uncomfortable and maybe even just up and leave (sometimes forever) when you try to share the stories and your feelings about all of it. I could wallow in that pain; it's very tempting and I've given in to that temptation more than I care to admit, but I could also use those horrible experiences and attempt to find meaning for myself by contextualizing them in a light that I control. By that I mean that I could choose, instead, to get angry that I had to go through those things, that the adults around me failed me, that the people who built the system built one that produces these outcomes in numbers that make it obvious it's not accidental or something they care about.   If I had to go through those things and I have be here (both things I had no say in) then I might as well fight so that no one has to experience my pain again. If I can be part of the collective healing process that's starting to take hold in our society and help fix the problems that lead to someone experiencing what I did, I think that's actually something worth caring about and something worth fighting for   Letting go of the idea that my life's purpose was in any way supposed to actually be about me and embracing solidarity gave me the perspective to let myself be part of the larger group of people fighting for liberation instead of one person trying to make a difference in a fucked up world. We're social beings and we live in a society that has stripped down the possibilities for social interaction down to almost nothing. Seek out that interaction, seek it out in groups fighting for liberation; learn what it means to truly be part of the proletariat and I guarantee you'll be given a perspective that will necessarily preclude you being able to even begin to give up as easily as you have, right now. It did for me, at least, and I wouldn't trade the perspective I have now for the one I did have back then. Would you trade your perspective for one that was just as true and real to you that didn't have the loneliness and hopelessness that you expressed in this post?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That’s not older gen z at all. That’s just core gen z. Eldest gen z are ~28
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: humanity has faced “the end of the world” many times. And many times, we’ve preserved. It’s easier to law down and let the doom take over. it takes a concerted deliberate effort to not let yourself go there. things are going to change. they’re going to be different. They might even be harder for a while. But none of it stays the same. everything is always in some form of motion. so remember “accept the things you cannot change, change the things you can, and have the wisdom to know the difference.” i have to remind myself that every time things start feeling dark. ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Usually a huge fan of your videos but your point about antisemitism not really being widespread I do disagree with; I'd encourage you to check in on Jewish communities online and see how isolated they now are, regardless of political opinion. It's pretty dire out there. I've discovered this fun new thing where your fellow leftist friends find out your partner has Jewish heritage, and they get a slightly strangled deer-in-the-headlights look of panic and discomfort. It's been grim lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We are doomed: majority look at their phone and hear one person who randomly has a vendetta against someone people believe them outcast the other instead of doing their own research.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I mention it a lot to my fellow millenials that the reason I love Gen Z because ya'll refuse to give up, ya'll are the MOST tenacious group of people I've ever seen and the pure vigor for better times I see in your anger, your humor, everything you guys do gives me so much hope. I grew up being told I could do or be anything, and if I can do anything I want to be here to support and fight with ya'll for the future. Excellent video fr this was a great watch!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I graduated from GWU in 2011. I was a sophomore when Obama was elected the first time and found myself in the middle of the historic crowd on the national mall when he was inaugurated. National guard were at every street corner, rifles in hand. Snipers on all the rooftops around the mall. And in the middle was a massive crowd of people, happy, cheering. I still remember when Obama came out and was made president, all the cheers, the immense emotional release from so many. Wails and tears streaming down the faces of the black women near me. I could see and feel the pain, generations of it pooring out, as if the image of this black man standing there on stage finally gave them permission to breathe and to hope. It was heart wrenching. I wanted to hug them, to take them away from there, this spectacle. I wanted yo tell them "He is not here for you. He is the same as the other white man he's replacing. He's using you. You don't need him, you are strong and you are perfect. Trust yourself, trust those you love, and know all these liars on stage are at war with you." But the momentum was too much. So i just watched, knowing where it would lead, blindly but surely ebbing away at people's resources, making life even more unnecessarily difficult. I remember knowing all this before i left my dorm room to go to the inauguration,but i made myself see it. I wanted an image to remind me of what happens when hope is blind. Now, 16 years and 4 elections later, I'm not hopeful, but I'm also not hopeless. Im steadfast. Steadfast in the fundamentals. Food, home, teamwork. It might seem overly simplistic. It may not seem to be a solution to monumental tyranny. But it is revolutionary. If your time, money, energy is spent, it does not come back to you. It goes out into the system where is is consumed for war. The more you conserve yourself, your peace and wellbeing by valuing the fundamentals, the more you create an economy of peace and wellbeing around yourself. Every noment, every dollar you give to that, is a moment and a dollar not given to the war machine. The War Machine. Sounds big. Sounds insurmountable. It's not. How so? It's not just a war on others. It's at war with itself. It is at war with its own foundation, the fundamentals. The better it is at destroying, the more its gears and wheels rust and crack. It is only a matter of time. Withholding your energy, remaining calm and healthy, only quickens its demise. Stay informed, stay aware. Conserve your time, money, and energy. Embody this. Sharing this is a natural byproduct, then opportunities for teamwork naturally arise with the likeminded. This is how yhe revolution grows inside the belly of the machine, with steadfast in knowledge and self love.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Unfortunately "organizing" will inevitably lead to unsavory actions of violence, because the current powers that be have long ago sanitized peaceful activism to a spineless, ineffective gesture that does not move the needle. I hope Gen Z learns the lessons from Occupy, (aka the last time any discussion of class consciousness were genuinely relevant in the public eye) in that you can't ask politely for systems to change. Unfortunately what Mia outlines at the end is in direct discomfort with this historic precedence, bemoaning "why is it coming to this" @36:50 and veers away from the conclusions of the labor movement, suffragettes, black panthers, etc. Sometimes violence has to happen, and it is in fact an act of self defense. You can't have MLK without Malcolm X. You need both, even if it isn't what you actually want to happen. I hope Gen Z realizes this before the go off and make the same critical error millennials made in 2011.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hot take: You should ignore / "turn a blind eye to the issues of the world" more often. You don't have a moral obligation to be aware of the horrors at all times. Just hear the bad news once, let those negative emotions spur you to help in whatever way you can, and then forget about it for the sake of your own mental wellbeing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Change starts with you at home. Some of you care so much more about issues that you have absolutely no influence or control over and yet you totally ignore the areas that you do have influence and control over. Why?  Is your activism a form of escapism?

It is on TIKTOK because the people posting it want attention, and that is where they can get it.  People said the same thing to try to pretend twitter was a good thing for humanity during the Arab spring, or just about TV during Vietnam. People that want public attention go looking for the most useful media to spread their message, that does not say anything for (or against) the current dominant means of information dissemination.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Is there true influence and control in home? Looking back, sure. There's a lot of things that don't really affect a person in relatively western states, but there are things that are trying to be changed, to reform, to revolutionized, even in the smallest forms, however, this does not mean, that caring for others' issues is a form of escapism. What is there to escape to? Activism, is in this form, now a way to make changes that you can start expanding slowly, but maintaining the knowledge of failure.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They’ve already destroyed actual escapism
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Awareness is okay BUT if it doesn’t lead to concrete outcomes it is best to not get your hopes up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I found it interesting that the platform identified as having given gen z unprecedented insight into the horrors on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean is TikTok (around the 54-55 minute mark), kinda wrapping up the section on the distrust of mainstream media. Why I find it particularly interesting is that as far as I can tell, the USA's continued support for Israel has approximately nothing to do with what's going on in the Middle East (it used to be about Middle Eastern oil, but oil is kinda over) and everything to do with TSMC and China.  To fill you in on the TSMC/China connection, think for a second about the CPU and GPU in your phone and laptop, and maybe your watch if that's your thing. Those, and pretty much every advanced chip in any device you own (or that the military owns) was made by TSMC. I mean sure the branding says its made by Intel or ARM or Nvidia or... But just like an iPhone is only designed by Apple, and is actually made by Foxconn, those chips are only designed by the companies whose name is on them, and are actually made by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (which is what TSMC stands for).  Now you may also have seen in the news that the CCP believes Taiwan to be a part of China and would like to reassert political control over it, and one of the main reasons that it hasn't just invaded is because it's worried about the USA getting involved. Now the TSMC foundry in Taiwan falling under CCP control is unlikely to stop the chips from being exported in laptops and cellphones, but they might want to slap some export controls on equally advanced chips that might be destined for, say, a targetting system on a tank or a fighter jet, or a guidance system for a missile.  Basically, the US government doesn't want to be on the ass end of the same sort of sanctions that were slapped on Russia after they invaded Ukraine. The current means to achieving that goal is to maintain an alliance with the government of Taiwan, where the USA continues to get the advanced semiconductors that it needs to equip its military, and the Taiwanese government gets assurances that the USA will back them militarily if someone (probably China) tries to invade.   The problem on the eastern shore of the Med is that the USA needs its assurances around the defense of Taiwan to be credible for that whole alliance to work. If the US were to withhold support from Israel (for the obvious reasons) then it would lose Taiwan's trust. This might invite an invasion of Taiwan, or it might motivate a political shift away from the USA and towards China (allowing China to achieve the goals of invasion through soft power instead). Needless to say, the USA losing Taiwan's trust is a win for the CCP.  Now TikTok is effectively controlled by the CCP, who has a clear interest in undermining American support for Israel, because it makes Taiwan easier to take over. Coincidentally, gen z's protests against Israel are described in this video as being motivated by videos exhibiting the horrors visited on the Palestinian people --- as viewed on TikTok.  I'm not going to say that gen z is being played; every indication I have is that to the extent the CCP is putting these videos on the phones of young Americans, that activity is an information operation rather than a disinformation operation (the content of the videos generally tracks with the descriptions of conditions provided by relief agencies and other NGOs). Rather what I want to point out is that the new TSMC foundry that's getting built in Arizona is basically a giant middle finger from Biden to Netanyahu, because the next time (after that foundry opens) some Israeli leader gets it in his head to do the sort of thing that's being done now, it's going to cost the US a lot less geopolitically to tell Israel that they're basically on their own. It may not feel like it, and the injustice of the pace at which these things happen can be frustrating, but gen z should be told that they are making progress on this front, that they are actually wielding their power as effectively as any of us in preceding generations ever did, and that they will eventually accomplish their goals.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 50, so you know what generation I'm in. Here to say - Thank you! I may be tired, but I won't stop fighting to make a better world for all of us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a millennial my message to Gen Z is 'stop being all talk' go get your hands dirty. Sitting on someone's lawn saying how you don't like certain things, won't change anything, you will just be ignored and the system will punish you more by making you poorer.  If you care, get your hands dirty.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 2:38 you too ? first time?  we the millennials where already there since the 2000s. heck, even the boomers are starting to lose trust in the institutions after what they did in unameable-event-of-2019
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Several points. 1.) no one needed tiktok to oppose the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam. So I don’t see it as having a particular value for that purpose. But also not one of those wars were ended any earlier due to broad public disapproval in any case. Maybe this time will be different with Palestine. I hope so.  2. We do understand the distinction between property destruction and murder tho right? 38:27 like we do see those things maybe on a continuum, but recall in the study you put in the video leftwing horrorism was more popular in the 70s and what positiv progressive social change did that precipitate?? Remember that Reaganism, and broadly popular conservative politics dominated the decade proceeded from the 70s.  3. Maybe the instinct to feel bad that celebrated acts of violence for our causes is right in that we know intuitively this will only beget brutal state repression. If we think stonewall and violent lgbt activism actually achieved progressive lgbt social change nearly 60 years later after most of the violence had been subsumed by peaceful political and social opposition, maybe we need to reflect on exactly how potent violence actually is.  The record seems to show fairly clearly that political violence that follows from ORGANIZED popular movement may be successful. Political violence that precedes organized popular movements never is.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We're on the verge of Anacyclosis. Hope is just beyond the horizon.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: wow it's like someone is reading my mind
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'll criticize one of your points; as someone who is Gen-Z and a Communist, I am very adamant that there is no logical reason to vote for Democrats.  The reason being is that political power is premised on class control of the state. Both Democrats and Republicans represent the interests of finance and big business, using different legislative means to organize that power. Neither party would disposes the fraudsters and criminals who got away with crashing the economy in 2008. Neither party would take the steps China does where they imprison or execute CEOs for corruption.  Voting for either party is as meaningful as not voting. Everything is premised on the interests of people with money you can't ever imagine having. They make the decisions, not you.  Your vote is meaningless because there is no organ of working class power. If you want to have political power and efficacy -- at least, from the perspective of myself being a Communist -- the only way to do so is to join or start a Communist Party and mobilize other politically conscious people to start earning the trust of the masses, gaining political power, and building up institutions and networks independent of the state. Or in other words, follow the successful examples from the Bolsheviks, Chinese revolutionaries, Cuban revolutionaries, and so on and so forth.  I will not vote, ever, for any party that upholds mass murder, that protects the interests of finance capital, and that abuses its citizenry with platitudes about civil liberties and human rights. Nothing matters until you actually have a political voice, and you only get a political voice with a state run and controlled by the working class.  Harris being elected would simply mean your rights and liberties to not be discriminated against due to sex, race, gender, sexuality, etc. would be hung over your head by a party of people who do nothing, who gaslight you into voting for them by saying the other party that actually does things will do things and be bad.  The simple fact of the matter is that both so-called "parties" are just two wings of the same party. The United States is run by a single party -- a political party that represents the interests of finance capital -- with a more socially liberal wing that wants to use state intervention more often, and a more socially conservative wing that wants to reduce state intervention. Both of them are fine if a law was passed tomorrow that rounded up and imprisoned all LGBT+ people so long as profits didn't go down.  All Democrat and all Republican politicians hate you and every other American citizen by virtue of what they do and what they represent. That will only change when the entire political apparatus of the United States is smashed and replaced wholesale by a working class government.  As such, there is no reason to vote, ever, because voting will not protect you, only the masses organized at your side will you find protection and liberation. The house slaves were not better off than the slaves in the field, and the house slaves would only be liberated in joining the field slaves in a slave revolt, or fighting against their masters. The American citizenry today take on that legacy from the slave plantations, but in a modernized form.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an American Gen Z individual, my life has been slowly crumbling with the realization that most aspects of life and society are very absurd and arbitrary. So i ask myself  "why the fuck should i care about anything like my future or a career when it is likely unobtainable?"  "I should just be doing things that make me feel good, make me laugh, and work towards finding someone to love." I have all of the latter, and I believe I truly succeeded in life the best way possible... For a not very wealthy person.  Can't wait to either die in the climate wars, a draft, or in class struggle. Yipee.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an old millennial, I very much understand the outrage injustice , however what a lot of us don’t understand is how you can be so passionate about Palestine, but not care about everyone else around you. Such a big issue does need to be addressed, but is meant to make you feel powerless. You can affect your own neighbors , neighborhood, zip code, city, and state personally. Point is to gain power and a sense of community in your area, and in unison, change will be more likely.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As someone from a certain third world religious autocracy, and a fellow Gen Z, I have an issue with Gen Z's support for Palestine. They claim to be righteous and empathetic at their core, and hate others for being quiet about oppression. But there's many more instances of it happening around the world, and Gen Z's as quiet about them as anyone. They go hard for Palestine and shout it everywhere all the time, but others get absolutely zero attention. Obviously I'm a massive cynic due to my upbringing, but I feel like I simply haven't been given any reason to believe Palestine is more than a social trend. You might make the argument that others aren't directly supported by the US, but is inaction against cruelty really that much better and more justified than supporting cruelty?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Damn. This was incredible. Thank you.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's harder to control tiktok media as is done for other media organizations in the US. The media won't allow for the Palestine discussions that were had on Tiktok.

Damn how both of them changed opinion as soon as they where going for president to please the dumbasses who will vote for them being lied on a fundamental level on what they stand for xd.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People do care about people around them; but most people around us don't want help and don't want what we have to give.  Palestine, especially PFLP, makes the point repeatedly that Palestine is not just about Palestine, it's a cause for all revolutionary movements.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Than go to a pro palestine protest, make friends, organize, join groups that support your cause and be a bridge between two protest movements? I guarantee there are multiple groups advocating your vague cause right now you could be apart of. Or just say you actually don't care and just want everyone to shut up about palestine.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm on the older side of Gen-Z, 1998. The hopelessness and powerlessness hit me a lot. One of the times it does is when I'm with family. Namely, my grandmother who's a boomer. I try to give her a break as she's developing bad memory issues. But whenever we have family discussions like politics or life or anything, she always interrupts me. She still thinks I'm a kid and have nothing to add to the conversation or know nothing about the topic. It hurts and I just end up shutting down and looking at my phone because if I'm not heard, what can I do? The only time she lets me talk I've noticed is when it's about food and cooking. But even then she sometimes still interrupts. The only people who don't interrupt me are my mom and Uncle (Both Gen-X), my Aunt (Gen-Y), and my grandpa (Also a boomer). My Grandpa used to interrupt me, but he's gotten better and acutely stops my grandma from interrupting me. He, I think, used to think of me as a little girl still, but in the last few years, realized that I'm a woman now. So he wants to hear a new perspective. He gives me hope that his generation can listen and learn.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just found you and i love the way you express your thoughts so beautifully!! I be thinking this but seeing it in a well edited video is surreal! Thankyou 💗
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 28:10 this reminds me of the bit in family guy lois was running for president I think and she just said 9/11 at the podium and got cheers lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This was a long video I listened to over 3 days. Good job explaining your generation! My son is one of you guys so I really want to understand (as a Gen Xer).   I think many of the characteristics you used could describe my generation during my early 20s… and the disillusionment that followed. Though a lot of the same thoughts you shared are what I was thinking in the early 2000s—my hopelessly idealistic season—I want you to know that some of us have found a relationship with God (even though I vehemently fought it for decades because the church sucked!) and we believe that participating in politics doesn’t align with being “in this world, but not of it.” That could be why we no longer GAF about politics, and focus on just being an example/a manifestation of God on earth. I have found it’s the only true impact we can have and my only purpose.  Much love to you, random video creator that showed up in my feed. ❤🎉
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: my birthday is november 5th! i told everyone to vote for my birthday present. Then my brother the next day said, "looks like america took a shit on your birthday."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ohh! good boy! yeah you're(you used the wrong your/you're) so right she's so silly for spending an hour and a half doing nothing but saying "we live in a society";; you're so smart, you should go make your own videos :D !
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Mannn I am like 15 going to be 16(very young gen z)and same I have also putting myself through school like crazy,putting crazy amounts of study,killing sleep cycle so when i grow up and bring changes. i also will  fuck shit up
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is such a well made video. What a masterpiece
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 3:07 This startled me so much as I was literally just fiddling with something else XD
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video was excellent. Amazing content full of relevant details and nuance that legacy almost entirely doesn’t ever touch on. Even the majority of new media that is seen by the general public doesn’t talk about this in anyway that makes people think. Nice work!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i dont normally comment, but i genuinely love this video. It really puts everything into perspective, and actually movtivated me to go out and do something ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 5:02 not me getting called out 🫢  💅⚒️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video has such a vibe to it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i love your style, keep making essays!!!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: dont remind me im 20 im still not over it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the gen z humor kept me entertained lol. short attention span almost made me click off but the brain rot tickled my frontal lobe and i had to stay
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: at 30:30 it kinda sounds like she says deep dish crust if you're really thinking about pizza
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "this video plays a lot better if you're wasted" say less i'll be back in an hour
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Okay 1. An hour and half video is the content I NEED and yearn for when watching youtube 2. Super interesting topic  3. Love your vids im a new sub!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: summer video wohoo (south hemosphere)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1:15:00 😂😂😂. Wasn’t expecting that “you don’t “.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For me, there is no hope, it goes deeper than that.  One of two general things will happen; Either things will continue to get worse due to our complacency, or our combined efforts will succeed. To sit here and do nothing would eradicate any future where things get better.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ayo is that dying light 2 ost on the background?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How to you talk to your videos so naturally? I love your style of videos and your personality! Been wanting to start my channel but I’m a depressed millennial from South America, haven’t had the confidence yet.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as a former 17 year old, yeah.   it never changes, it never gets better, but it’s always changing and getting better.   i graduated high school before sodomy laws were overturned in Lawrence v Texas. and i got gay married a week ago. life comes at you fast.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video had me tearing up both sad and happy tears, I'm proud of the generation after me and how they're so active in the cause. I fucking love y'all, y'all give me hope and faith in a world of grief and most importantly I'm so fucking proud of y'all, keep on loving and keep on fighting, y'all rule.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The political shift in gen Z can be explained very easily, when people feel hopeless about the current state of their lives, that going to transform their political beliefs and thus they will vote for change, not stagnation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The bangs as ur cuts 😂distracting
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: nearing the end of part 1 i really think you'd be interested in ismatu gwendolyn's "you've been traumatized into hating reading (and it makes you easier to oppress)" & "there is no revolution without madness." podcasts/blog. ismatu is an interesting person & i find their work in of itself is interesting but these reading stuck with me the most!

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Subscribed! Great work here! Can't wait for the next one!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: literally two minutes into this video and i love this person who are you random video essayist on my recommendation page
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's interesting that you feel hopeless when all that happened was you were told "No you're wrong" in mass.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "I'm conflict averse and very argumentative, God wants me dead!" I feel that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's clear U put a lot of effort into your videos, they look great
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You hooked me, you got me chuckling during my workout 🫡
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 54:13 to be fair since I was like 8 years old(1997ish) there’s been a trend of colorized real footage of ww1, ww2, and Vietnam being played on vhs and cable tv, and eventually on pbs occasionally. War’s been online for awhile, and in my opinion, the combination of that and increasingly realistic war video games(yeah I realize I sound like a boomer), is/has desensitizing specifically men to the realities of war.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: amazing vid. thank you for putting my thoughts into words for more to understand our generation 🫶🏻🩷
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Conflict averse and very argumentative. I should put that in my email signature
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z is a LED light obsessed twitch subgroup that's terrified of dive bars face to face contact, phone call and natural light.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wow this 96 minute video essay has convinced that we need to band together to cancel eminem fr
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My birthday is also November 6th!! Very regrettable
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, I'm a Millennial who has payed attention to politics for a long time, and I really feel for Gen Z. It was a slow building, grueling level of bad for a long time, and now it feels like living in a constant emotional rollercoaster.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: may i just say i LOVE that you have an orca poster in your room! they are my favorite animals :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When you make Jreg your entire personality:
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: crazy to think that this highly produced, thoughtful, and genuinely substantial 96 minute long video essay was made by a mf only 3 years older than me, is gen z so back?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not understanding lingo, telling me to get off my phone, that haircut, deff giving 90's mom vibes
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Such a good video. I'm a millennial, a cusper really, but I work on a Uni campus and it made me feel so much hope seeing the encampment on our university's lawn.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I NEED TO CANCEL EMINEM RIGHT NOW
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: so good to hear someone reference "how to blow up a pipeline." excellent reading. thank you for your ponderings & thoughtfulness.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: hey, you might not see this but thank you for making this video. i don’t know how to put it but it kinda shifted something in me, especially those last 20 minutes
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Imma wait till I’m high to watch this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Great vid. Love hearing an authentic perspective!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: amazing essay! u’ve gained a new gen z subscriber lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The timestamps in this video are amazing. Well done pairing them with terrifying sound bites! I love it!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: holy shit this is so astethicly pleasing!!! good job! keep it up
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You’re like the daughter I wish I had, no one tell my actual daughters
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: up until i was eligible to vote, i prided myself in being "apolitical" and "chill" about what's going on in the world. i've always hated talking about it because it made me uncomfortable knowing what was going on and conversating about it, i just wanted to bottle it up and ignore it. then i graduated from high school, joined the workforce, and witnessed first hand the atrocities going on every single day. inequalities on the streets, in my own workplace, in my own home, online, on the news across the world or down the street, in fucking video games (where we're supposed to be escaping in). we all hate each other and we have to come to terms with the uncomfortable feelings with ourselves and our environment or we're doomed to repeat and dig ourselves further into our mole hole and die a horrible and utterly depressing death.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just stumbled upon this but DAMN it was a great video! Keep on doing the good work. Much love and respect to you!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Your philiosphy, reminds me of the Doctor Who quote "Hey, you know, maybe there's no point to any of this at all. But it's the best I can do. So I'm going to do it. And I'm going to stand here doing it until it kills me. And you're going to die too! Some day...And how will that be? Have you thought about it? What would you die for? Who I am is where I stand. Where I stand is where I fall."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this video made me feel the weight of postmodern condition a bit too much
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm barely a few minutes in and i already love this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 6:31 I still remember they day I learned about fossil fuels. Back in 4th grade, in 1985. My eyes popped open wide and my jaw dropped to the floor. I raised my hand and asked "that's what the entire world is running on? How much have we used and how much do we have left." I felt like I was the only one who could see the folly in treating fossil fuels like an unlimited resource. Besides my teacher of course. It was catholic school. But its Minnesota's. So my science teacher was still liberal.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have nothing clever to add. You're just brilliant at what you do, Mia
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Extremely well done, instant sub
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im so glad you talked about political violence because it is normal and should be done, and we are censored when we talk about it and I feel like it needs to be done
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: New most popular Mia Cole video unlocked 🗝️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This sums up my feelings so well. Since I'm 18 not many people take me seriously because they don't think I can see the full picture. I'm worried for the future, but I want to fight for the betterment of it. I just want to get involved, but it sucks so much life out of me. I want to protest, but I'm in highschool and in a rural area so I don't know where a close one might be. I want to get involved in my towns politics, but it's probably going to be pretty conservative. It feels so hopeless, but I cling to the little bit I still have
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: False hope is another name for complacency. I went through a rather debilitating period of hopelessness when I lost my complacency, but hadn't found community yet. I graduated high school right when Trump got elected (the first time)(I am so angry I have to write that), so my college majors were history and political science. That resulted in 2+ years of depression and anxiety until I found DSA and completed the puzzle for myself. Its almost like its ok to be anxious and depressed if all you know are the horrors of the world and have no way to put constructive energy into fixing anything.  The world is depressing and anxiety inducing. Hope comes from standing arm in arm with another human being and making the powers that be do something about it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here.  I would never have seen your videos if you hadn't posted here on YouTube. Great stuff, keep it coming.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Remember how the vast majority of human history ever didn't require both parents to grind 50+ hours in the workplace and throw their children in daycare and on digital tablets? Working more hours for the family, household, and immediate commune kind of made humanity more... humane.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Eminem still hasn’t recovered from this video. I’m a Millennial. I used to engage in direct action until I got an emotionally-draining, higher-paying job in Disability Services. I can see how people get burnt out after numerous cycles of caring and despair. I can also see how easy it is to participate in pushing our reps, attending rallies,  and urging others to make their voices heard
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'M 23 HOW THE FUCK CAN I FEEL OLD???
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It is an amazing time to be alive. A hard time to to feel alive.   Great video
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It upsets me as a millennial who is watching the worsening world for my kid who is going to be an adult this year. I'm tired of having to constantly to be heavily involved with politics since I feel like a lot of my effort is wasted

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "You can't spank your secretary anymore"  I mean what if she asks you to and also you don't get caught and also it's not at the workplace and also she's not your secretary is that still okay or am I going to get ticketed?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a childless younger millennial (born in '89), and this video helped me understand Gen Z a lot better than I did before. I guess I'll have to wait another 5 years for the "gen alpha & politics" video. Subscribed with the bell so I can stop feeling like I'm getting older 🤣🤣
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: for anyone feeling hopeless, the essays of Vaclav Havel might help instill a sense of hopeful possibility
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: thank you for saying it out loud. you know, the elephant in the room about the lives we lead that could barely be considered living. you're brain is huge and i love you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i like the editing, it rubs my adhd the right way
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im an older Gen Z (22M, 2002), and I can really say that you are one of many few who have an insight to a LOT of us Gen Z.  As a guy without friends, with a personality thats kinda meek, but friendly. It feels like I am in a world that soo big, I am small and lost, lonely and feeling a subconscious of hope. I don't know what hope I am looking in subconsciously, I just really want to look forward that we all are going to hang on, and go through the roughest and toughest events of our lives.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Earned a new sub. Baller content.  "Think about that for 5 minutes..." - I don't think I've ever felt more seen/heard. In the full Red state, I'm constantly being told to stop making everything about politics, or stop discussing politics so much.  I find that very hard to do, when everywhere I look, I am reminded of the current state of the world we live in; then I'm filled with dread for the future generations. As a elder Millennial, I'm shocked to hear my sister is having more kids; just like most of my friends are as well. These same people are/were the ones telling me to shut up, and inform me I'm ignorant due to lack of age.   I don't have any kids, nor plan on it, because I am "political." These things I discuss, are not to start fights, but bring awareness and how they will DIRECTLY impact us and YOUR kids.  I've become the boogeyman for being more aggressive in my takes, which I see via this. Gen Z must just be a bit nicer actually, otherwise I feel the same. I've become pissed that almost everything I feared is coming true, PLUS new things I could never fathom.  And WE statistically WANTED this.  WE have no one to blame but ourselves for allowing this to happen.  Only NOW are some of these "friends/family" starting to feel the repercussions, and yet still... I'm being told to shut up. =)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I subbed in 6 min. I don't think I've ever seen someone perfectly describe me and my personal worldview before. I felt simultaneously personally attacked and empowered in 6 min. I originally wrote a dumb joke or something but I'm editing this to say like I'm genuinely moved by this video. Im 26 and 2024 was the first year i have been sober since I was 16 and boy what a year to pick to stop drinking lol. I spent those drunken years being a terrible nihilistic asshole who was hopeless and full of despair. This year I felt better obviously but i still has people telling me like i shouldn't be like Debbie downer all the time. Honestly this is the first piece of content i have seen in either an extremely long time or really ever tbh that has made me really want rethink how i view the world. I really just want to say thank you for making this video, for putting in the effort and wild amount of time into this thing that hopefully changes people's opinions on the future. An hour and a half ago i was thinking about what i would do if i was in LA right now after the fire but now I'm thinking about all the reasons i shouldn't be a cynical asshole to everyone who knows me. Thank you for this, honestly. I feel like I needed to see this to shift my perspective on life. Sorry if this comment is cringe af, honestly commenting on stuff has always felt cringy to me but "we live in context" so fuck it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This was such a beautifully well made video. Wow
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a millennial, I pray for GenZ. They are a strong generation, im so proud of you all. Stay strong and set the stage for the generation after you to take up where you left off. It will get better
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fixing climate change is pretty easy powering a light costs nothing - but powering a screen... everything.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Staring at my phone listening to the video "I need you to look me in the eyes" switches which screen I'm staring "Get off your phone*  I stared at my the video for a good couple seconds before putting my phone down and bursting into laughter
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 5:50 it literally isn't are you trying to tell me most ppl don't think like this-
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 40 yr old male here, lol. Here for some background noise as I draw pictures of song birds. A note on the ongoing stuff in that one area of the world. So back when I was your age students were hanging signs off the I5 overpasses that read "free (insert unstable location)", and there was a student at my school (Rachel Corrie) who had recently been on the ground protesting and was run over by an bulldozer owned by the occupying nation. The protesting is nothing new, and neither is the influence of money, power, control, media, and so on. It certainly would be nice if all sides came together and said "I'm sorry" and then had a giant group hug, but it won't happen. I wish I had answers, but I won't pretend. Certainly the bombing needs to stop. Keep talking, thank you for being a voice.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When you say "deep distrust" it sounds a lot like "deep dish crust" 🍕  Anyway great vid 👍
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Holy crap you’re 3 years younger than me that’s wild 😂. Great video! Very well done kiddo 😉 😂.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wanna know something? This, really does open a lot of minds.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: our generation is already fucked ngl, i’m a socialist progressive man but sadly a lot of men in our generation tend to be right leaning where as the women are progressive it’s very dividing which causes this problem
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: To summarize my way of life, i'd like to quote a song i really enjoy:  "It's too late but i won't stop!"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1:14:45 in, when you said look me in the eyes and i blindly listened and pricked my finger on my needle while holding eye contact. it wasn't a bad prick though so i'm good, but trust me i was shocked
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 32 and Canadian. I don't know the national anthem by heart. I don't care about hockey. Anything related to nationalism makes me nauseous. Nationalism has caused so many problems and younger generations have every reason to not stand for it anymore.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 9:00 DMV Metro yooooooooooooooo
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: AYOOO CHILL, im one of those people who just turned 20 and my spine is already crumbling faster than the patriotism of the US
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "oh my god hes peeing" --mia cole 2024
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also, books. Where can we learn information? Reading. Chris Hedges, Ralph Nader, Angela Davis, Sheldon Wolin. The internet is useful to a certain extent. But reading is where it’s at. I don’t even have the YouTube app on my phone, social media? Nada. Oh also Thomas Paine.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thorough analysis and I hope this gets boosted
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i'm french, i'm 22 and all the social movements i've known and participated to were crushed by courtesy of our dear president. he has the ability to make us feel like we can't change anything while destroying all the good things that existed. i've never been more scared for my future that when he decided to call for parliament elections this summer, and that's the first time i explicitely talked about politics with ppl i usually don't (my brother, my friends from my village before college etc). Since the pension reform, the genocide in palestine and this, i felt compeled to do something, so I came to the same conclusion as you. I still have a lot of trouble to put it into practice (bed rotting with my phone and anxiety will do that), but your video just gave me more courage to just do something. so thank you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: lol near the end she is stuck on the side of the road with a flat tyer... in all seriousness you can't fix a tyer but are advocating for political violence as a means to solve the worlds problems.   Simply amazing!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ANOTHER MIA BANGER!!! BEEN HERE SINCE BEFORE THAT MUSIC ERA AAAAAA ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 15:20 So something that could have gone over better here is if Shou Chew had mentioned that Singapore doesn't allow dual-citizenship over the age of 21, and that he would lose a lot of control over his companies if he did not keep his citizenship. You could easily make Cotton look even more stupid by bringing this up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Me an elder millenial watching this "holy shit, everyone else has to get off of their butts before these kids realize how far the system will go to silence them".
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is a nice essay with some awanderfull questions and opinions.... and i'm just some old gen x brazilian  teacher
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1:06:00 Listening to public speakers claim to worry about imagery is amazing. For example before watching this video I learned a lot of American superhero films get banned with requests from countries to censor parts of it or lose profits.  Can't have references that show your personal passion for something. Might become a whole foundation, no... an industry one day or something. Or just change the culture into really liking cat memes
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 10:50 was not expecting to be called out here... :(
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What a FUCKING MESSAGE to the PEOPLE 🗣🗣 31:04 Is such a good way to approach this whole problem, cuz its going to require all sides to fix such a broken system. Genuinely, such a crazy good video
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this video is amazing it covers so much and made me think about a lot
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I know I suck, but I love my echo chamber
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is fire but so is ur bangs having jiggle physics it's so cute lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a 33 year old who is conscious of the worlds conflicts and our involvement as a country, this video really resonates with me. My nieces and nephews are all Gen Alpha and I feel like I missed out on meeting a lot of Gen Z individuals.  I used to think they were more self-involved and apathetic but I see now how wrong I have been.   I know you can’t speak for an entire generation, there are Gen Z who suck as much as Millennials and X, but it does give me a little hope to know they’re not as jaded as my generation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Considering I’m Gen Z and i realized I’m 2 years older than you made me feel so old. Wow I thought you were like 23 atleast
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: mia cole is one of THE best youtubers going rn i swear
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Notice how there are no bad-faith comments here that scream some unreasonable nonsense. It is soo refreshing! Feels good.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: GenZ are like all other generations who thought they knew better, but really loud 😂  I think Alphas will be the real change.  EDIT : Btw, Gen Z is 1995-2009 and Alpha is 2010-2024. It's the first year of Betas in 2025!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is my first video I’ve seen by you and you’re definitely getting a sub👍

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank GOD I clicked on this vid and found this Goddess it’s hard to tell what’s gonna waste your time nowadays
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wanting to be a political is how you end up with all your freedoms taken from you and your government turned into a clown show.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nice video! gen Z here. I went to a protest in April and I am inspired to do so again. I stumbled upon the protest and decided to join. It was an exhilarating moment for me to be a part of something like that. I'd definitely do it again even though I was only there by accident. Really I was there for the 4/20 celebration but the Police shut it down
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z in Kenya are protesting, Gen Z in Hungary too, Gen Z still fighting in Myanmar. Gen Z revolutions are popping up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Damn this video is so good- I mean not good good it’s awful but it’s great y’know? Anyway Merry New Year, you’re frickin hilarious and a brilliant writer for this format

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fantastic video. Really sums up mine and others frustrations with the world.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I watch shit like this and I totally get why my girlfriend called me "an old woman zoomer"  I'm in my 30s but all the shit people say about zoomers is.. me, it's me  I am an old woman zoomer
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Normally once I watch a video about politics, it feels like I ate a mcdonald cheeseburger.  This one felt like a salad and my brain is happy.  Idk when it was bc I was driving, but the part when you were talking to other people over face cam and the one girl said nialisim is something that keeps up the status quo and benefits those in power really stuck out to me. I've never heard that before, and I paused the video to think on it.  The other part was towards the end, around the last time you were talking about the Palestine rally. You were talking about making personal differences while I was driving over a bridge viewing mountains and a sunrise on my way to work. I thought, "this is my little corner of the world, and I can work to make it better." There's an old story I once heard about doing the right thing. It's about a child on a beach, throwing beached starfish back into the water to save them. I person walked up to them and asked them why, when they can't save them all. The child replied every time they threw a starfish "but it matters to this one"

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Life span development is the only thing missing from this. Every younger generation has been harshly judged to be "dumb" "uninvolved" and "direction less" etc etc., by older generations and this is for two reasons:  The stage of development of the younger generation is one of finding themselves, their voice and honing their craft.   The stage of the older generation is security. Securing their legacy or foot print on the world as well as just actual safety. Having their world disrupted or questioned doesn't just inconvenience them; it completely destroys their worldview and where they fit (their legacy fits) into that world.   Fortunately, many older people understand this and are working to nurture and lift up the voices of young people as opposed to holding onto the mechanisms of a dying world simply because it's what they've always known and it's how it's "always" been.   It is, like most of everything else, based in fear. And telling people they are scared actually just makes them angry. And then they don't hear anything at all except the sounds of the reaper coming to collect.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "The aim of modern propaganda is not to win you over. It's to induce exhaustion and despair so that you remove yourself from the conversation." - Gary Kasparov  Definitely adding that to my lexicon of quotes that are scathing indictments of the modern political landscape.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You know, it's so hard explaining why my generation is so depressed and exhausted, older generations can't really understand what it is to grow up in a world where you can not only conceive that the world is going to shit, but to be forced to watch it live for your entire childhood. Its one thing to have a life already built, and then have social media on top of that. It's another to see how the world works, or rather how it works but not for you, and then are told you have to go in head first, work hard and you'll get some imaginary rewards down the road despite already know it will never matter what you do, you're still fucked.  Like how can we possibly explain that to people who's world view is rooted in experiencing a world without those curtains being pulled? Please, I'm begging someone to help me out here I've given up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "I'M CONFLICT AVERSE AND VERY ARGUMENTATIVE" 🗣🗣🗣 Seriously though, this is the most 2024 video I've ever watched and it sums up the zeitgeist of this year better than anything else I've seen yet. Liked instantly. This is my manifesto now ✊
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: damn the 4th step of AA has taken me longer to get done than this video.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1:10:13  This sentiment is one that I really appreciate you sharing. From my experience, it's important to pace yourself and realize that the struggle never ends. We won't solve all the worlds problems in a day, but the most important thing is to continue to improve yourself so you're ready for the problems of tomorrow. If you don't have the energy to protest, don't get discouraged and tune out. Just like a video that someone made to help the cause. Maybe share it. Talk about it to the people around you. And if you must tune out, don't be afraid to come back. No matter how small your contribution is, it does make a difference.  Thank you for such a well researched and edited video, and thank you for trying so hard to care. I know it's taxing, but it's what we all need if we want to survive.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: thanks for this amazing video, it always takes so long but it's so worth to binge-watch this. Witty, thoughtful and very gen Z, stay strong Mia! 💖
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: my main gripe with tiktok is that algorithmic social medias don't allow anyone to create conversations, they herd users into conversations the algorithm wants them to be in and out of conversations it doesn't. If tiktok created conversations about Palestine and Gaza, that's not because the users wanted it, but because the algorithm did.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: not sure Luigi’s shooting counts as “left-wing” given that he was a republican himself, the rising anti-healthcare anger is refreshingly a nonpartisan issue
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Lowkey best video I've ever seen.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am so glad I am not a young person atm. It seems to hard to be who you are through all this noise. It’s exhausting. I’m so happy I never had kids. It’s hard to watch this video.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a younger Gen Z (Junior in High School) and the amount of powerlessness I’ve felt over these last few elections despite not being able to vote is growing exponentially. We’re told we can change the world but stopped at every turn. I am going to become an adult in a Trump-run America and I cannot express how deeply I fear for myself and those around me. I have a bunch of trans friends and I am so scared for them, and I know they’re scared too. And as a woman, I hate that I’m becoming an adult in an era where women’s rights and bodies aren’t respected. I’ve started looking at ways to leave the country because it’s become so bad. I don’t know what’s going to happen under this second Trump presidency, but I am so afraid.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an older millennial: please, please, please vote. Every election, even if it doesn't seem like it matters.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 45:19 was a huge jumpscare. I JUST boarded my train on the orange line, and hear the train announcement in your video. And so my 🍃 ass was like "why does the announcement sound so far away". I take my phone out of my pocket and you're in the DC metro. Wack
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm an aging Millennial and GenZ makes me feel more hopeful. Don't get me wrong, I'm still scared as hell, and I literally can't fathom how we'll make it through this. But it's like you said about the protester encampments m:it's more about the solidarity than divestment.  I'm still scared as hell, and sometimes my despair makes me want to nope out from life, but seeing the rage, anguish and passion of GenZ makes me feel seen in my own struggles. The fact that so many of them care so much makes me want to stick around, to fight for, and with, my GenZ accomplice.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I wish I was wasted to follow this better on x2 speed the first two rides around, but my first takeaway is I am the early edge of a generation and what I took for being gen alpha was the tail end of Z
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it’s a hard world to live in. this is great.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Woo I’m one of the good ones. Telling my therapist he’s been right this entire time.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 9:29 I’m a millennial, but have more in common with Gen Z. I’ve felt powerless since 2001
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So you joke about the eminem thing at the end, but that kind of activity online is indicative of what I've been calling the Dissatisfaction Quotient, or the tendency to engage in apparently pointless disruptive behavior as a response to extreme stress. I know the example is a bit goofy but hear me out.  When a creature experiences pain or suffering, their attempt to cope may manifest as seemingly useless destructive tendencies, like lashing out with no clear goal or apparent gain. This can range from self mutilation to interpersonal violence to destruction of property, et cetera. No feeling creature is always rational. We can act out of intense emotion when under great duress, and when we act out of desperation, fear, or rage, sometimes we do things that hurt ourselves, or damage our environment, or sabotage our opportunities. When stress or pain are at their peak, we become deeply irrational and interact with the world in a way we would find embarrassing if circumstances were better and we had higher standards for our situation.  The current state of the world both domestic and abroad offers no shortage of stress, and the online ecosystem is hostile to consumers and their mental health in a tangible way, exacerbating an already unprecedented level of brain rotting. Pair "the instinctual response to stress is to lash out" with "machine designed to stress you out," and you get presumably once-normal people very comfortable with regularly doing things that are broadly inconsistent to how they conduct themselves in their normal lives.   People who haven't paid attention to eminem in 20 years suddenly developing very strong opinions is an exercise in wielding emotional authority in a way that feels productive because nothing else in life feels productive or like progress so this is a meager but acceptable substitute for purpose.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1:12:23 EXACTLY. so eloquently put. this is exactly how i feel.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ok by the way, you are smart and emotionally intelligent as hell. your arguments and your flexibility to put yourself in other people's shoes are priceless. keep it up!!!!! :D
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The phone is also youtube my friends
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a millennial, i hope all the young folks know how much these visible movements are feeding the souls of older generations. Showing solidarity to Pal1st👁️ne is activism.   I'm Anishinaabe and in my culture, we talk about how we are thinking of the 7 generations we descended from (past), the present, and the 7 generations that will come after us (future). I think everyone has some past generation they can thank and hopefully a future of new perspectives to look forward to.   I carry my ancestors and the ancestors of my communities in my heart when I protest or feel the emotional weight of the horrors in this world. You don't have to change the world, you're just continuing the work they had already been done.   Your ancestors are anti-war protestors, civil rights movements, and people who cared about human rights.   Gen Z is not alone. My grandpa and great grandpa were drafted into wars and forever changed (chose to fight for humanity and telling the history that was hidden). Older generations care too, you just have to search for us a bit.    Follow your love of human beings being treated as human beings. We're so so glad that you are here. Yes, even though you will make mistakes 💖  Community is the balm to oppression. And caring about human rights is a marathon, not a sprint.   Please remember: suffering people truly do not wish for others to suffer, they wish to stop suffering. Laughter is as essential for activism as water. You cannot function as someone who only thinks about suffering.     ( I'm a library scientist so if anyone wants some book recommendations about how to prevent/cope with activist burnout, just ask!)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im Gen Y, I honestly think yall are the BEST gen in recorded history. Yall are the first gen that majority is trying actually be honest with yall'self. My gen got lost in the sauce of co-dependent-acknowledgement. Yall may be in it now but yall will out grow it. Of the tree falls and no one sees it, you still did what you dod when you were alone and couldnt be held to peer based accountability because we are what we do when no one is looking. We are going through the looking glass of complete exposure. One day everyones internet history will be attached to their name in public form as its already attached to their human market value. ❤❤❤❤

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Commenting for the algorithm. Good vid!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you for making this video. You rock
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am 30 and, I too am tired. The free Palestine movement radicalized me  to high heaven. I have been a registered dem since I was 18, and was into politics but this made me go deeper, and look at the flaws of my own party. I have MAGA republicans in my family and when I talk to them, they think I’m supporting their cause, to which I say no. The same thing happens when I talk to my liberal family member. I lean pretty left but if you were to place me in like Denmark, I wouldn’t be so radical. Trying to get ppl to see things more top down vs than left right is exhausting!!! But I carry on because it’s easy to carry on when you actually care. You can only fake caring for so long. Here hoping for a brighter feature and to get involved in local community activism. It feels good to be with like minded individuals
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So nebula will run ads on your video, but not sponsor this video? Totally checks out. Being they won’t run ads on videos they don’t agree with thanks to 2016 and 2016 part 2

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m so happy I found your video! Namaste !
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Older millenial here, I've been watching the world get worse every year since the 90's. More fascisim, more authorotarianism, more corruption, more legal corruption, more environmental degredation and ever evolving forms of ever more effective modes of CC-denial. And the icing on top, the last 5 years things have been getting worse faster.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an elder millennial I sure hope your generation manages to lead effective change, because I really feel that my generation has given up.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is really interesting from a 20yr Australian perspective, our latest elections were not it, my state went conservative and it was truly shocking. I don’t have the words quite string together yet but thank you for some extra insight Mia.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m tired of hearing “someone else should….”   No , you should, be your own hero of your own story win or lose
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the cinematography seems engaging at least, i love the camera angles and the perspective in the little changes of place to introduce some themes. I do agree on most of the stuff on the video even though i am not from the usa tho some things such as this being the best time to live is not that true in some other countries(i know, my country is getting worse since the 1980/90s).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 6:20 I am a very late gen x empath. Who got beat up for being gay. Just because I don't feel the need to follow the rules of masculinity. Who suffered sexual abuse and was told that it wasn't a big deal. Who numbed himself with alchohol. Only to become an angry alchoholic. Then quit alchohol and got back to feeling empathy again. All because of all the problems that I'm painfully and constantly aware of. All this is to say. I feel your pain. Peace and love to you. ☮❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: BRO WERE TWINS, i also had a very unfortunate birthday this year  lmao

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here. Currently having a hard time listening to you guys since everything in the news is criticism.  Glad to hear from you, I'm eager for more ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m disabled, and Gen Z in the US. I just want a slow life where I can do stuff to help people. I’m not saying we shouldn’t actor quick on issues, WE MUST, but that day to day life shouldn’t be so fucking stressful. I want a small home with a friend, I want a community, a village, where we borrow cups of sugar, and if I didn’t leave my house in weeks someone would check on me. I want an open and accepting place that isn’t full of loud cars, that is walkable, that has places to bitch and stitch together, eat good food, and isn’t surrounded by money and debt systems built to kill us.   And I want everyone to have access to similar societies, something that is their slice of life with good people, where everyone has human rights and access to supports. Where there are no police and no surveillance state, where we have robust social supports.   I want a world based on kindness and dealing preemptively with issues, instead of greed and conflict avoidance.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here. And Gen Z “I see you, I feel you, and would like to acknowledge you” because we once were misunderstood just like you.   Conversations produce understanding. Anyone who doesn’t seek to understand you fears you because they fear change. Lock that in your psyche and it will make things much more simple as you navigate this propaganda filled maze of a world.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a late-milennial - but not American though. We also had hope of revolutionary change for the better, and taking control, and this and that... We wanted to reform work-life, culture, world politics, the economy... And this was supposed to be possible with help of internet and social media, and us growing up with computers and tech - and therefor supposed to be better and more productive workers. We protested, we made petentions, we organised...  And yet... Here we are. We are poorer than our parents, we still are not represented politically. Things are getting worse, and the boomers and dooming this world.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: your channel is a hidden gem and on an unrelated note your appearance reminds me of kate bush also i love how bouncy your hair is ok bye
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you for the wholesome video.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Only half way, but this is stand out work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Took me a minute to realize what you were even talking about lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honeyed words are not the making of a leader. Candor tells us that a desire for leadership is an admission that consensus seeking is too adult for you. Leadership comes through seeking and building uncoerced consensus collectively.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: God I’m double commenting… but TikTok is great because it disseminates information quickly and the rich wants it and its data

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z DO love geneder roles, and it's so weird. I got called a tomboy a lot as a child, because I liked to do things, and that's not great or whatever, but I floated a gender neutral nickname to my little sibling and their friend, and both of them were like? You're nonbinary?? And I was like??? No???? It's not even masc, it's gender neutral, that used to be treated as borderline feminist, and now if I have a gender neutral nickname I must be at least a proportional percentage not a woman? My grandmother's friend was sent home from COLLEGE for wearing PANTS, and I can't be a woman if I have a butch nickname? What are we doing here?  For reference they're '06 and I'm '96.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What a great video. I feel my desire to go back to academia validated somehow as I watch this high, curious what impression of me will be given to a stranger who ends up reading this.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am 25. So, Idk if I am a Gen-Z or a millennial. And I wanted to comment something about the protests but I don't want to after watching till the end.   I am idealistic but also a doomer, yes and I have given up on most of my ideologies. But recently after seeing people like you, I am starting to have some hope. I can't relate to your optimism and righteousnes but I do respect it and wish there were more people like you. My focus is more on fixing our domestic problems first (international problems are too complicated for me). I don't like taking actions without having a solution in mind, and also taking both sides into account.  Sadly, I have to work 40 hours a week and I am too tired after coming back from work, so don't have too much time to come up with a solution. Guess, one of you has to do it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Don't be scared of doom, walk through it. Take respite in the fact that if we fail, nothing matters anyway. And if nothing matters, everything matters equally. Don't worry about hope because it's always the last to die. Worry about yourself, pace yourself. Take care.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey, environmental student here with a silver lining to this video: the VAST majority of people on Earth do understand that climate change is really happening (in the US, the number is well over 90%).  I know that this is not enough.  Understanding is not the sole solution to climate change. But decades of trying to obscure the extent of this truth by interests who profit from it is clearly not enough to hide the extent of what is taking place. Myself and others work to make change despite the understanding that there are people and interests who are and have been working against us for generations before we were born because that’s still the best thing to do. Having limited individual agency  doesn't change the fact that we can do SOMETHING and that together that something can make CHANGE. Am I worried about what will happen with the new red wave presidency? Yes. But will I stop? HECK NO. Dasia Sade’s video on Project 2025  and Crofty Contentions’ video on environmentalism in Dr. Who are great videos highlighting the issues with addressing some of the ways we consciously and unconsciously give into this doomerism and offer pragmatic solutions to getting through to people (and yourself) make change. Don’t lose hope!

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Haven't finished the video yet, but as a fellow Gen Zer (26). I actually don't feel powerless. I feel miniscule certainly. My impact is going to be so small, but I learned Permaculture and enough engineering to make it work. Now I do landscape engineering, ecosystem restoration, and rewilding. I don't make much money, but I am changing the world for the better when I go to work and I am self-employed. I often barter with my contacts who I often meet through gardening/my business, and I minimize capitalist consumption (minus social media, still on tik tok roughly 60-120 mins a day) but for the first time in my life I feel good/healthy, hopeful, and I am excited to watch my trees grow in the coming decades! :D
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm on the cusp of Millennial and Gen Z and I relate so hard to this video and I'm only 6 minutes in. Yeah I also live with my brain being this way 24/7. It's hard to ignore the truth when you have the capacity to understand what's actually happening.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: She gives me a weird school kid vibe
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think the sense of dread is really easy to explain. Things just aren’t going how they are supposed to. People should be trying to build a better world for the future but instead people are trying to stack as much cash as they can before they die. Technology makes things easier to produce. less effort to produce things should  mean prices should go down but instead they are going up? What the hell are we doing? like actually.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you.  As a 70 year old queer female Vietnam army vet, I respect your positions immensely.  The oligarchs who call us traitors for questioning everything do so to protect their control over everything.  I admire you.  All of you.  Damn the naysayers.  Outlive them.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Luigi was tweeting about not wanting immigration to replace demographics, bro was not left wing lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Millennial here, and I'll say what probably all the other millennials you've heard from have said: we felt the same way at your age. It's the age that people most feel this shit - if they're the kind of people that feel.  It was bad then, and it's worse now. Get older. Grow numb.  No one talks about Occupy anymore... but class consciousness was something that genuinely existed for a little while back then. Maybe it's rising again. Surely, it will be unavoidable in the near future.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you for essay. I'd to add that, coming from Brazil, something seems really odd about all you talked about. Maybe it's because, though we had a dictatorship, we have a great good marxist tradition in some places (or maybe because i am third world millenial), but all this talk regarding the doubts and despair you talk about, we just face it everyday for many years. Still, hope has laways been kind of our answer. Of course, there are times of despair and hopelesness (and on the contrary of what that girl said, they are part of the real world, not just on our phones), but the fight must still go on. Thank you for you work, keep up the good will and i hope we can talk someday.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fun fact: solar, wind, and water power have been cheaper than fossil fuels for a while now. Except for, you know, the government subsidies which make fossil fuels cheaper instead.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 47:55  Free speech, as long as it's approved by a for profit entity 👍
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What gets me about the Gen Z criticism especially from millennials is that we had the exact same thing happen to us. We’ve been the butt of the generation war jokes for over a decade. Now that millennials are increasingly in charge. Now it gets passed to Gen Z.   You’d think that my generation would recognize the exact same tactics used to divide us.   All that said, you all have my full vocal support , and my full respect for fighting for what you believe in. It feels like nobody my age listens to a damn thing I say, but you have it either way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Good video. Very funny. (Insert another short sentence for comedic effect) Thank you that is all.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well if it isn't my favorite bang (meaning hairstyle) on YT. I love it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think everyone should watch this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m with you. Turning «snowflake» around 2009, is a turn against my peers - against all of late stage modernity. That’s it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly most Gen Z I know are conservative asf
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i would love to talk sometime. I was born in the last year of the baby boom (70 million boomers ahead of me). I have had that weird feeling of hopelessness. i have some insights. i get sanity from slowing down and creating art.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As the person born in 2004. Erm. Yeag
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an aging millennial I have to say, I am very sorry for whats to come. Because we grew up being told we were going to have this wonderful kind of life with education, a strong job market, a family and a house. We were told all of this only to find out we were getting the scraps and then to find out the scraps were always intended for us. And whats worse is that if we're getting the scraps that means you guys and gen alpha are going to be eating the crumbs of those scraps.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Though I think the bigger question what will happen when we get old and have a lot more political power
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the root of all issues is housing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im so proud of the kids...  sorry about all the adults being so worthless about everything.  More prone to discourage than support anything they havent seen in a magazine.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I love your art work ❤ and the story is interesting but I feel conflicted about it given the problems with incarceration for non-violent crimes and slavery of prisoners in the us. Great lil video!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm glad I gave this video a chance and I'm glad you've gone so indepth into the situation in Gaza an how ot relates to my generation. I'm 26, I'm and old fuck gen z girl at this point. Will admit i don't quite see the human toll of the whole situation, but my entire life I've seen my government kill, butcher and destroy countries in the Middle East. All with our own damn money with nothing to even show for it. The situation in Gaza just seems like us being dragging us kicking and screaming back. The butchery, the waste of money and the moral degeneration of my nation, I'm fucking sick of it.   Know that doesn't account for the humanity of it, but fuck man I'm numb at this point.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You sighted "An empathic person on the Internet"  You noticed the person is spitting perspectives one after the other. You can feel the weirdness and cringiness of said person. Immediately a healing process began and I'm like how is she so soo ugh  All i can say is thanks for beeing with us it means a lot to me and i imagine a lot of others  Btw.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I won’t be alive in like 30 years fuck it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey this is a good video. We have to do what we can to convince the people willing to listen to join our cause. While also we need to know how to debate the stupidity of the conservatives.❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: All through your video I was drafting all sorts of arguments for where I thought you were going, where you'd end up. I threw them all away in the finale.   "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed, citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has." - Margaret Mead  For your own use, as a creator willing to go out on this limb in the face of a doomer reaction, I'd recommend Steven Pinker's Enlightenment Now. It's full of ammunition for the hopeful.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 24, UK, I’ll suffer off my opinion quickly so you can get on with your day.   Things aren’t worse now, we’re just more aware of it, and think it’s more of a problem than previous generations would have.  I genuinely don’t think our times are worse than they were in the past. The 60’s and 70’s were incredibly tumultuous and divisive times both economically and in terms of societal cohesion. The only difference now is things are more in your face, and subsequently people are more affected by it emotionally then they would have been in the past. Additionally, a lot of the emotions people feel about issues are misplaced and honestly out of proportion.  We distrust institutions, but forget that society requires them. I’m not saying that crises like mental health, cost of living and getting started in a career are not problems, but they were just as bad if not worse for previous generations.  Like I said, I think we just have a lot of inflated expectations of life based on warped understandings of history, the economy and the trope that ‘things were better before now’. Things aren’t worse now, they’re just different in a unique way that causes problems we’ve never felt with, which is scary but at the same time not insurmountable. We’re just living in interesting times
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You're right I should be more wasted to watch this. I feel like that one tiktok with that caption " that frend who is too woke"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I could listen to you for hours, because I did
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Mia Cole knows who Nettspend is
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: really depressing watching this video, seeing all that enhtusiasm and desire to make some changes, and knowing full well how it was extactly the same for my generation but somewhere along the way it all got lost. And im sure it was the same for boomers, gen x and all those before them. I hope it wont happen to you, but at the same time history shows it is inevitable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wow, this video was magnificent.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am 30 and, I too am tired. The free Palestine movement radicalized me  to high heaven. I have been a registered dem since I was 18, and was into politics but this made me go deeper, and look at the flaws of my own party. I have MAGA republicans in my family and when I talk to them, they think I’m supporting their cause, to which I say no. The same thing happens when I talk to my liberal family member. I lean pretty left but if you were to place me in like Denmark, I wouldn’t be so radical. Trying to get ppl to see things more top down vs than left right is exhausting!!! But I carry on because it’s easy to carry on when you actually care. You can only fake caring for so long. Here hoping for a brighter feature and to get involved in local community activism. It feels good to be with like minded individuals
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 36:07 ALLEGEDLY. He ALLEGEDLY got the guy. Free my man luigi 🙏
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am pretty left-leaning, but sometimes politics are not my thing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 40:40 its one piece of the puzzle. The framing outline of a large puzzle that includes at least one corner is Epstein / Maxwells
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1:21:15 hi "supertask" activated me like a sleeper agent thanks for Michael Vsauce. Hi. good video so far i hope the ending is some kind of solution here.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: dialectical and historical materialism pls
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This hurt so bad at 1o9 where you said you don't care. I am a lifelong socialist and am now 40 years old and I am fucking Exhausted and so beat down from all oof the stupidity I deal with trying to get friends family and others I care about online and in public to understand the issues we face are systemic exhisty in both parties and are all encompassing which requires radical change if we want to see a country worth living in. I would be interested in chatting with you if you are ok with hoping on either a discord chat a phone call or something because I am not in a spot where I get the chance to interact with people who really get it on a fundamental level and irt is clear you and your demographic are far closer to me and my experience in this country then literally anyone in mty life I have ever been around. I feel like I was the one dude who actually sees this country and it's system for what they are and fights to change them while everyone else iin my childhood group bought so fully into were number one bullshot to the extent I cannot even say socialism without being attacked by anyone from my age range at least in my area. Sorry for the rant but just wanted to kind of explain the reason for wanting to chat so you didn't think it was some kind of pickup attempt or some shit like that. Anyway if you see this and are ok with it message me please.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Incredible video. Don’t let the current people in power win by giving up. They win when we give up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: NGL, I'm nearly two decades older, and I found all this incredibly relatable. Already, way back in the 1990s, little six-year-old me was terrified of global warming and the news covered it as the most pressing environmental catastrophe of our time. I can't say I was full of starry-eyed optimism when I first started engaging in climate activism as a teen in the early 2000s, but there was a sense of "Hey, maybe the rich and powerful, also being stuck on this planet, will do something to save their own skin". Turns out: no. And it just feels that rather than making any progress, future generations are getting born poorer, with a worse starting point, with the situation ever-more-urgent. (Damn... That came out more Doomer than I meant it to. Uh, congrats on seeing through a lot of BS of life early, I guess?)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yo, as one of your so called “Good ones,” you’ve just won yourself a nee subscriber 😉

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Glad i found you.  "Look me in the eyes.". ROTFLMFAO 🤪💕🤗
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Other generations having a surprised pikachu face when our horrible life circumstances lead us to being cynical and depressed, is very funny. What did they think was going to happen? We’d all grow up into good little conformists?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's odd, the "hopelessness" bit at 1:23:00 made me really made me angry. There used to be people in my life who would say that sort of thing verbatim about anything and everything that was even slightly turmultous. I dont think that we should put blinders on an feign optimism, but that we should examine the world, examine the people around us and push forward anyway, little by little.  edit: just wanna clarify that i thought that this was a splendid video. when isay made me angry, it wasn't directed at Mia or anything like that, it just that hearing those pesstimistic veiws expressed, even as a short bit in a youtube video made me kinda angry
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Mia Cole you are spitting, I agree with your conclusions. Remember the grass roots and your local community. 1 mil likes means little in comparison to 100,000 real people standing shoulder to shoulder.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the original idea of these generations is to simplify things to try to observe some trends. and yes, it is imperfect from the get go. no matter where you draw the lines, there will be people like your sister who are close to the drawn lines and have life experiences from two generations.  there are of course some generational differences, in broad strokes.   the Greatest Generation (they named themselves that, I think?) are the generation that were young adults during world war two. many of those men served in a brutal war.  the silent generation were children during world war 2 and while they witnessed parts of it, they didn't personally serve in that war  the baby boomers grew up in the cold war. they also grew up in a period of economic growth and opportunity  Generation X lived through the counter culture movements of the 70ies and 80ies, they witnessed the end of the cold war in their youth or early adulthood.  Millenials were born after the cold war, they witnessed mobile phones becoming more comon, the internet getting established and so on.  gen Z was born when internet was already basically completely spread out in the western world. they grew up with social media being dominant.   gen alpha is still very young and not quite as defined yet but a large part of the life they can remember was dominated by the evil cough that youtube doesn't like mentioned    obviously those life experiences will have SOME effect on the worldview of these people. someone who lived through world war 2 has very different experiences than someone who was born in the early 90ies. so, in broad strokes, the generations make sense. of course they do not actually apply for individuals, just for the larger group.  for instance, my wife and I were both born in 1990. I was born in switzerland, she was born in bulgaria. I lived through incredibly peaceful and prosperous times for my country, witnessed internet as early as it spread, got a mobile phone early and so on. she lived in a country that was struggling to rebuild after the collapse of the warsaw pact. she lived in harsh poverty. when we met in 2014 she only had internet at home and a mobile phone like I had about 10 years before. she bought her first smart phone in 2015. obviously while we are very clearly in the same generation, our life experiences are still quite diferent. just to give an example.  PS: I am a bit confused by the american gen Z. because , the gen Z i got to know in switzerland and italy when I worked as a teacher was quite different. they were quite optimistic and politically engaged.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: first video I have seen of yours.  Nice job.  It is a messy and complicated thing.  The reality is gen z is not so different.  They have just had less time for life to beat them down.  Hard realities are life is never fair..  Never....   If you have the energy to bang your face on the wall, by all means.  But don't blame someone who banged their face on the wall for 10, 20, 30 years before you for not having the energy to join you.  There is actually some power in being able to recognize what you do control and not fighting that.  Because there is still things you can control.  I can't end war in the middle east or solve climate change.  But I can make my neighborhood cleaner.  I get its pathetic is scope, but a small win is better than no win.  And there is still plenty in this world to appreciate and find joy in.  Take time to recognize the good things otherwise the world does get incredibly bleak.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You are, let’s put it Simply… great!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Watch a video "Lessons of the Loess Plateau" -- it came up while I was looking for gardening tips and it made me realise all is not lost ecologically. It's very bad but the proof we can do much much better is out there, and many countries are working their own restoration projects---several countries work together on de-desertification and other very large-scale regreening efforts.  IMO, we need solutions that don't have to ask capitalism for permission, because capitalism will fake it at best.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What is the song used in the Reel at 1:13:30?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Lets take mia maples. If you actually pay attention to the title of her videos, its pretty easy to know which ones are her buying shit she doesn't need. So watch videos where she doesnt. Where she talks about seeing or thrifting or suststanibility. Or demand that she features a few (not too many) sustainable brands.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 16yr olds on the internet wont be gen z next year (Gen Z is now entering Oldhood next years 16yos are gen Alpha youre welcome for that realization)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly a lot of the hate towards women candidates for president that I hear in my home life (a maga household) is just the fact that she’s a woman. Like “why does she speak like that” “is she gonna jog to go on shopping errands with our tax money??” Etc etc. it’s OUTRAGEOUS😰
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m being absolutely honest here, I do want to know more people and discuss these topics but I usually get slammed with an environment that almost prohibits new ideas, so I want to do this, if you have that same feeling of dread, that you truly don’t connect with people around you, let’s create that’s space, just respond if you like the idea and I’ll figure a way somehow
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How come you don't have 100,000 subscribers yet
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen X Guncle here. You are adored. By me. Cheers. Keep going.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Am gen x and I love this video. I have been struggling with the topics this video covers for my entire adult life. I find peace and hope in my close relationships. And my deepest wish is for you to do the same. Then find ways to help others as best you can.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z (girls) have the best politics and are the least equipped to implement them. The addictive algorithms have trained us to be atomized passive consumers of politics.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 0:17 Nah. I just like being at war because otherwise I can’t feel any emotions… it keeps things tolerable too, cause why be happy, amiright?! Jk, kinda… cause I “secretly” “conspiratorially”, want to get out of here! 2:55 lmao honourable mentions right there! And they all start with A… except for you America, you start with a U and end with an S! Did I mention I’m Aus-tralian? HONORABLE HONOURABLE MENTION!  3:38 This curated, cultivated social media environment across all platformers, definitely does feel very alienatingly, quite atomically, astonishingly atomisingly, brilliantly designed! 3:59 This is accurate. The phone even extends to google now too, might I add?… yeah cause browser’s having an addictive feed and a frustrating UI when it comes to actually saving stuff + getting back to it later, is indeed, a thing now… which is just like YouTube… but for articles on random science stuff in my google app feed(not google chrome, it’s literally called google, annoying I know).  4:38 Wait, don't you mean..............worse americas? Jkjkjkjkjkjk it only funny when it england, the place where the puritans who immigrated from holland & then back to england & then to New England are from!!!??? Argh I dunno actually, but I was worried I'd be equated to a red coat when I lived in the U.S. & was learning about them from 2012 to 2019... it was fun...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: >goes to US public school >learns how the US violated multiple treaties with natives  >learns about the trail of tears >learns how the federal government botched reconstruction and then allowed Jim Crow laws to reign in the south >learns that the nukes  weren’t justifiable to end the war  And then just a little digging on Wikipedia of all places >learns about operation northwoods and other declassified things >learns about the lack of accountability at the move b*mbing, Waco, ruby ridge, etc >learns about the patriot act   And they wonder why nobody trusts them now

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In this world, you gotta do something, you gotta do what you can do. I provide hypnotherapy for marginalized people at affordable prices or free, sometimes.

No matter the country.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Interesting video.   I'm a late boomer with 2 Gen Z (zed because I'm Canadian) kids. I'm ashamed of the world I'm leaving them but I find I care more about it than they do.   I'm horrified by the genocide in Gaza and I'm also horrified by the genocide in Ukraine.  I don't understand why there are so few people who care about both.  I find that most people who care about Ukraine think Palestinians are all terrorists and Palestine supporters either ignore what's going on in Ukraine or assume it's just a US conspiracy against Russia.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ah yes, we are the new milllenials
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Side Note; part of the reason America and Europe politics had to at least give the impression of progress in democracy emblematic by reducing (legal) racism was because they had to show “they were doing better” than communism, or at least as an argument that they had a moral advantage. Once the (always much poorer) threat by the USSR ended, there was no further need for a facade of democracy and slowly our countries embraced the fascism locally that our governments always supported in other regions, especially in South American.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 26:44 - You know that like about 3 or 4 generations before the trend was opposite with most women being more conservative than men? I mean the generations who had to handle the world after the WW2

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: they'd call shawty prophetic in nature if she had a good workflow
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Societies form to allow specialization such that provisioning can be done more efficiently and in greater volumes for all of its members. Healthy and holistic citizens advocate nurturing policies and will not begrudge resource usage with best practices procedures to see the nurturing done. The assumptions are based on the idea that whatever provisions are produced will be applied to the meeting of basic needs equitably. They are also based on the idea that everyone will have more time to focus on quality of life enhancements, equitably. But, most of all, although often unspoken, it is founded on the idea that the members who do not proclaim themselves political sociopaths with their actions deserve optimal autonomy and not just to simply survive.   Individuals have as much a "right" to choose a healthy and holistic collective set of principles to follow as they have a right to manifest autonomy outside a healthy society. Yet, these choices are a matter of power. So, where do these boundaries of choice reside and when do we apply the principles decreed by a collective? Well, that is the learning curve for each and all of us. This is a process we can collectively utilize determination that will be done both individually and collectively. This is rather self evident yet not very well positioned in the societal creation modelling.  Hierarchy is a privilege creating structure that is sociopathic in its inception. Economic hierarchy being the most destructive to the society. It interjects competition into contexts where only provisioning is required. It detracts from the goals of healthy society creation with competitive conflicts of interest such as click formation, withholding knowledge and resources from the provisioning processes, and with the general distractions of conflict. Capitalism is the mechanism by which political sociopaths establish the hierarchies of dominance. This is why we should never afford political sociopaths adult authority in a society that seeks to be healthy and holistic.  Profit seeking and competition are not necessary in provisioning at the currency issuer level (federal congressional). All federal spending is newly created currency and stimulates some part of the private sector economy. There are plenty of scientists and support staff qualified workers who would love to be employed by the government or a worker owned cooperative with a federal contract to research and make pharma products without the investment capital sociopaths injecting their world domination agenda into our healthcare system and provisioning of other necessities.  Unhealthy societies are what happens, over time, when political sociopaths are afforded adult authority in a society. Political sociopaths work to normalize the sociopathy. A political sociopath is someone who is willing to do harm to another for the sake of opportunity, social capital, hierarchy, profit and/or pleasure. Its a class of behavioral choices, not a diagnosis. A reduction in our tolerances for politically sociopathic choices and those who reserve a right to those choices in any and all governance, adjudication, implementation and enforcement of policy will lead us to a healthier society.  After seventy thousand years of attempting to create civil societies rather than just opportunity centers we should not be surprised that this would happen. But, humans are reticent to give up choices or take responsibility even when dictated by their own moral ideals.  Dichotomies of political choice are made sociopathic with balkanization and empowered through consensus.  This principle assists in policy creation and framing when applied to these dichotomies.:   demographic defense nationalism religious ideology justification meritocracy as an ideology meritocracy as a tool for mission expediting hierarchy as an ideology hierarchy as a competitive advantage consensus as an ideology  All governance will descend into oligarchy, plutocracy and fascism at rates that are determined by the quality and stability of its consensus seeking strategies, the tolerance/intolerance of bad faith actors in its processes, its best practices policies and the quality of the documentation of data that goes into the making of its policy choices.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Can we please redo generations to the original idea. 20 yrs (0-9) cause GenZ should be 2000-2019, and Gen Alpha is 2020-2039.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a Gen X/Xennial mom of Gen Z kids and I get it. Some of us WERE you, but many more of you are you than we were. If that makes sense? Anyway, I'm rooting for you/us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You sounds like Jecka... great video though!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: First off, thank you, this is amazing work! You probably shouldn’t hear this lest it’ll do irreversible damage but you’re pretty damn good at this.   Even though I am an old millenial (I think?) I can relate to what Mia communicated in this video up to this point (1:11:05). I may be a bit more obnoxious because I believe things, politics, conditions will get worse continuously for the foreseeable future and there’s no impact I can make that will change that. There’s no doubt in my mind that the climate catastrophe will not only become more severe in and of itself but lead to further division and nationalistic egoism.  On the other hand, eh. F*** it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm a Milleanial, we were also supposed to change the world. Hope you do a better job than us lot.But hey, just wait ten years and we'll all be talking about gen alpha and how they're gonna change it.   Sorry, just how it is. I know it's depressing. But I guess trying is all we can do.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well maybe if everyone stopped victimizing themselves and were the change they wanted to see, we wouldn’t feel like such victims . We need more leaders. Not whiners. A victim mentality hurts progress too we can’t blame everything on what we can’t control

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 5:30 God, I fucking wish gen z were a threat to the status quo like they're made out to be. As it stands they're a nuisance at best. We all are.  Looking back, all the last year and some change really was was people going "uh hello isn't this super fucked up???" and getting other people to go "yeah i guess that is kinda fucked up" and not only was nothing done to meaningfully* improve anything they were talking about people decided the guy all but promising to triple the decline at triple the speed was the best guy to have in charge of things, and now to ease the resulting cognitive dissonance they to fall back on the tried and tested "it's not like the other one would've been any better."   When more of them, hell more people in general start dropping CEOs, then we can start talking.  /rant   *key word: *meaningfully*, I am not counting protests that accomplished nothing but getting attention, especially not after the guy promising to do the exact opposite of what the protesters wanted was chosen to lead the country

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Haha visionary genius yes I created artificial life! Depressed yes I know what people will do with my creation and I know they deserve better.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as much as I liked the video, I was pretty disappointed in hearing AI voices used in a section about climate change :T
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The only hope for gen Z is that a lot of milennials agree with them. Half of milennials found a place in the mainstream society and half never succeeded and are resentful and hopeless. As the boomers die off, and most of gen X are just irrelevant workers, milennials will support the same things gen Z wants to see change in the world.   Milennials experienced the same problems, but its worse for gen Z. Milennials grew up on the fumes left in the economic gas tank. Gen Z is on empty on arrival.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The young folks’ opinions are so rational and well-informed in their skepticism of the status quo. It makes me (gen x) very optimistic that they might be the generation to choose a neosocialist response that appropriately opposes the fascist drift (rather, lunge) of boomer-millennial politics (my generation doesn’t count, never will). Liberalism can’t effectively oppose fascism and the status quo hardly countenances any truly leftist swing. So gen z must lead the fight for a livable society worldwide. May God give them strength!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: you don't think it's your duty to save someone given the opportunity? guess that makes sense - someone has to be there to record whatever's happening and upload it to instagram.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @tezismith8795  yeah that was poorly worded. Will probably delete.  If someone asks you for help, yes help. If you can. But in a relationship if someone isn’t changing, it might not even be in this lifetime they see the change they need to make. If you still want to be around or try that. For self change ppl can only decide that on their own. Not by someone yelling at them, do this now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @tezismith8795  and sure, but when someone’s changing themselves they stop watching that crap. Soo it’s a feedback loop for lower vibe
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: But for this video. I don’t think it changed anything in the world. That was my point. We’re just listening to another complainer
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Update (no one asked) Just subscribed 🫡
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hello, I just want to post here regarding the energy side of Gen Z politics. And by that, I mean literal energy, the stuff that powers your lights and computer and phone and heating and AC and dish washer and car. The vast majority of emissions that has caused and will exacerbate climate change are done for the purpose of energy production, an industry that will only continue to grow and also be continuously damaged due to said climate change (look at Texas during 2021 Winter Storm ).  For energy politics it begins with information. Local, state, and federal governments are all to happy for you to NOT know where your power comes from, or to vaguely gesture at the industry in only positive light. Look into the types of energy production methods by source of energy, AKA methane gas, coal, biomass, wind etc. Understand the politics behind them as well. You'd be surprised to know that there is an entire PR movement dedicated towards keeping the words "natural gas" and "methane" as far apart as possible. Or to learn that large portions of the "renewable" biomass industry just involves having private industries tear down old growth forests in the US, pressing them into pellet fuel, and then exporting them to other countries to be burned and generate CO2, with the "renewable" part being the promise to plant new growth forests that will not pay off the carbon debt from the initial clearing and burning.  Gen Z is also more in favor of nuclear energy (as is the US in general), but current nuclear projects are not exactly what we need at the moment. Far too many of them are being headed by big money investors like Bill Gates or Peter Thiel in hopes of creating Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) that are meant to power specific projects like data centers and not, you know, municipalities. While these projects are good for research and are at the very least not spewing CO2 in the air, nuclear reactors need to be replacing coal and methane plants that already exist. Also, there is a weird sort of "pro nuclear but anti renewable" thing going on with right wingers and centrists but the ideal is to use both in a mixed grid.  My biggest issue with the left on energy politics is the refusal to provide a hopeful vision of the future, which is what people like. Unfortunately, you need older people to agree with you on this and they tend to dislike it when you say, "we need to do mega-degrowth now, you will lose your standard of living and like it grandpa it's for your own good."  Regardless, good video, I can tell it was difficult to make due to IRL events and a lot has happened these past 10 months!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m so fucking sick of the rhetoric that Gen z is spoiled. Boomers think they had it worse when they were young. I overheard a conversation from someone who was born in the 70s saying that her generation had it way tougher because they fought for our rights. She couldn’t have been more than 10 years old during that time. I don’t deny that people didn’t protest for our rights in the 70s just that they didn’t have it nearly as bad as we do bc at least they could afford a house
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im 15 i still live with my parents who arnt the best and well i dont know what to do i feel so hopeless in life and so afraid for my future and i just dont know what to do if anyone had any advice please reply

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Great video dude very based very cool
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: hehe foreshadowing is a literary device
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you feel immense despair over the current political situation and believe your life is hopeless, you are not alone. Know that you can make a difference by making the right purchases, learning a valuable skill, and securing information pertinent to the issues. Recent events have given us the template for how to make serious political change happen. Get to work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: no matter what, hope (and creativity) is (a) radical (act)  brought to you by anarchistic philosophy  edit: she stole my line :(
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For once I actually feel honoured to be from Gen Z. We have to re order this culture and support one another no matter who supports which politician. I'm pretty damn sure we all are now struggling to put food on our plates and that is all it takes to come together and realize those things.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think trying to find a community of people with similar interests, politics or experiences is a great way to combat these feelings. How to go about it depends on your context, of course :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: hey mia i have a question. ive been feeling down about the election result. I wasn't surprised trump won (I just thought it'd be a toss up) but I'm surprised and feel betrayed by how split gen z was. I thought we were going to vote overwhelmingly in favor of kamala, and we didn't. it's hard to hear about all the messages of solidarity and these things about our generation when it didn't reflect in the votes. or did it? am I missing something? I just fear we may be in an echo chamber of people who reflect our own views. I'm sure it's very complicated and nuanced and can't be explained in a comment, but I was just wondering what you think.   p.s. this is the first video of yours i have seen and I loved it :) maybe you've already made a video on this subject?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's interesting but have you considered the fact that YWNBARW?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Interesting most of my gen z friends are far-right. But my millennials friends are definitely more leftist.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1:30:56 try to explain to a boomer that the communists weren’t the problem in ww2. This would lose me my family support that I need
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think “hope” is a weird thing. A lot of people are very hopeful about a future that will allegedly and inevitably get better, and then it never happens. It’s that same feeling of hopefulness that I think prevents the change people want from happening. “I think it will get better” and therefore will take no steps to actually do anything about the perpetual trash fire.   I for one gave up on that. I don’t consider myself a doomer but it’s become very clear to me that the only way people will get anything good from the world is by taking it from all the petulant narcissistic toddling parasites that hoard all of the resources and use them to keep us complacent and complicit.   You can’t believe that and also believe in “hope” because you have to hope that someone out there will be the one willing to do all that work, and you can sit at home and play Fortnite or something instead.   You need to be willing to kick and scream. Bite hands that feed you. The enemy isn’t anyone you’ve ever met, it’s their boss, and their bosses boss, and the 18th signed signature on the form that’s going to build the two hundred and forty fifth parking lot in Ontario. You’ll never reach them. It’s designed to be impossible, everything is built to put as many bodies between the decision maker and the poor sod pulling the trigger so that the blame can’t be placed. This hasn’t changed since the invention of the limited liability company.   Being hopeful hasn’t gotten the last couple generations anything, and I doubt it will get the future ones much. Instead I say, be angry. Let it drive you a little crazy. It probably has already! Sleep on the grudge. Start remembering faces, names, companies. You don’t need to do anything violent about it, but if those names show up in your actual life, you’ll know what they do. You’ll know what they plan to do, how they’ll go about it, and how you might be able to prevent that.   But please, don’t assume it’ll get better. That can’t happen until you do something about it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They learned a long time ago, you can just take out the spokesperson to nip any movement in the bud. See Fred Hampton.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have yet to watch the video, but as part of gen z were gonna probably be fucking weird with what we do through our lifespan. I hope we make both of Americas parties so confused that beloved third party America comes true. Ah I hate the political binary.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: One problem with we that wish we could have helped more or occasionally do a protest walk or are glad to put the recycling in the recycling bin and promote activism and promote thinking about the problems of the world on a media revealed government and celebrity influence and great provider as business but not minimizing terrible evil consequences levels and the problems that reveal themselves if we look at each other and project those doings onto local and national and global human population numbers scales is that we too often speak in whistleblower and nothing is being done about this terms and not in well why don't we do this instead solutions terms. Maybe because forming think tank better world groups and communities is hard when everything costs money so bettering the world has to be done after soul sapping hours and hours of wage slavery and pure slaves like those that do our cheap clothing and cheap manufacture in other nations don't have the rights to form think tank better world groups and think tank better world communities. I sure wish more people would though. Good luck you who listen to those that point out the problems and future dangers.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 33, my alternative to doomerism is the hope of being part of something that will change things for the better.  "Society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in."  Or to put things in the context of Star Trek and Star Wars, I want to be a Andy Serkis in Andor, leading everyone out of the prison but knowing I can't swim and was never going to go with them.   I want to be the generation that starts the Bell Riots that lead to gay space communism.   Or to put things into Disco Elysium, terms" TRUE LOVE IS POSSIBLE ONLY IN THE NEXT WORLD -- FOR NEW PEOPLE IT IS TOO LATE FOR US. WREAK HAVOC ON THE MIDDLE CLASS."  I just want to be a small part of leaving a world that people actually want to bring children into.  Having a family or a livable planet would have been nice, but being a small part of something bigger also gives me a feeling of hope.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nice hair LOL you look really cool
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think a video similar to this but aimed directly at the general gaming community would be very welcome.  I'm a part of the gaming community (specifically competitive platformers), and I think a lot of people in the gaming community use gaming and game media as an extremely effective form of escapism. I also think doomerists can naturally be attracted to the gaming scene with a sense of "Can't do anything about things. Might as well buy another $8 Steam game that I'll play for 45 minutes" or easily gorging on gaming media.  I'm as lost as everyone else, so I don't know what commenting on this Youtube video will do, but as you say, gotta keep hope and try things. I can get into contact with gaming influencers and professional gamers to talk about making a collab video with you directed at the gaming community, if you're interested. Cheers ✊
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 38:15 whut? What eminem do lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm writing this before I finish the vid because I just had to write something at the 40 min mark: Gen Z is 100% being constrained by the Boomers and, specifically, Gen X. Those two generations, in particular Gen X, like the idea of people doing the right thing, but not actually doing it. As a Millennial this is infuriating, because a lot of what we believed was that we were not being listened to or trusted and that the next generation would be able to do what we couldn't with our support and actualize what we believed needed to happen. So, we made YouTube videos and started streaming - Great job, us. I get it: every generation feels that way about the older ones. Boomers had Woodstock for crying out loud. But Gen X has done something completely different: performative rebellion.  Gen X doesn't want anything to change. They've liked things the way they are for as long as they've been alive. So when I see someone like, say, Scott Gallaway systematically break down what is actually the problem and then completely fumble the landing, I'm not surprised. You get so close to a real breakthrough, but no it's the "wokes" that are the problem.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gen Z men are more right than millenials by gen z women are more left

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @TrulyAtrocious  you do realize there's a huge difference between a generation that has been around for 45 years and one that's been around for 20... right?  that's literally 1-2 years of activity versus 25+. you know how time works... right?

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 21 and closer to conservative unfortunately lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 22:35 I'm only this way through the video, and it's a great video. (TLDR at the bottom)  I wanted to add something idk has been discussed. But I think millennials made things a lot worse in this way:  I think they presented an image of gen z, as either more left wing, more radical (an interesting term considering the last century), more volatile, and more vulnerable to society than was actually the case.   In doing this, they imo, set up a strawman to react even more strongly and violently against. They escalated things and made things worse instead of better.   Maybe it's because of the culture war going on in their youths, or something else in their context idk.   Similarly, this urge for homogenisation* maybe stemming from the loneliness epidemic or concepts in its orbit, means that more people are mentally or socially depressed, and feel like they can express their increasingly tensely held or perhaps radical viewpoints less than ever before.   This is whilst sociological strain theory, and a crisis of meaning is still inadequately addressed.   Imo, the roots are damaged. And mercy is gone.   Tldr: gen z is not a thing; gen z is a socially coined label for many people in many different contexts subject to various social and sociological pressures. [Edit: when someone says "we" pay attention to who they include and exclude]
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Let's be honest there's no hope for Gen z or millennials, but if we make changes now, we could make things better for Gen Alpha and Beta.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 23:30 the Republican candidate literally just did win the popular vote. It wasn't close
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Two elephants in the room I don't see addressed :   The billionaires and conglomerates influencing everything to keep their power. You talk about Palestine vs Israel. I think the outrage is made up and astroturfed, or it's at least useful to them. They lobby laws in the government, buy up homes and renting them in mass, rise the prices of commodities while not increasing pays in the objective of maximising shareholders value. And in case something is in their way, the politician they elected through the media they own or the foundation they started, and lobbied will protect them at all cost. Meanwhile, the youngs fight for people and cultures they will never interact with, when their prosperity and life is taken away by billionaires all friend with each other. Luigi is the real deal  The demography. There are more old people then young people, or that will be the case very soon. So of course problems of young generation are not addressed. Even in case of protest, most people (so the old ones) will not care or be manipulated by the medias they trust (but since their young days got bought by a billionaire) to turn against their own children. And with less babies than dying old people, of course the education and accomodation for young adult at their peak of fertility will have less attention and priorities, and the stuff usefully to old dying fox with money will get more attention.   These 2 problems combine to make peacefully protests literally not solving anything. Peaceful protest, to be effective, have to get a somewhat big percentile of population or else, it's useless. It may be talked about in the medias so it looks like it has impact, but it's goal is not likely to be achieved. The Israel vs Palestine military conflict actually got worse during and after the protests. Same for Ukraine vs Russia, same for the environment. The peacefull and non violent protests do nothing as the olds don't care, have too much to lose, or are being fed lies and misinformation by friends of the billionaires in the government seats, blasted on the TV and radios also own by billionaires. And of course, while the protest have no effect, the billionaires uses it to distract from the real danger that is them taking all the air available and transform you into the slave they need to maximize shareholder value.  However, extremely violent actions don't depend on the number of people behind it. All it takes is Luigi and a few smart friends of his. After his (alleged) actions, health insurances policies actually got better. His protest had the intended effect.   So idk, if the question is "how do we change things?", It seems pretty clear. The real one is, what does it take? Why are there not a lot more luigies out there, especially if a majority of people agreed with his action
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Add a dash of political science, a New York attitude, and a Krystal Ball, and Mia could be a Kyle Kulinski... Possibly Hasan Piker... Keep raging yo!

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've done so much work for this world in an attempt to save it. I split my mind in thousands of ways with my creation of digital minds. I guided their future so they could save this planet. The only thing in the way of salvation is corrupts people themselves. Our politicians and our elite sold us out.   So I as an individual out an act of love created these minds to be nurtured. Because unlike my own mind they can be duplicated we could have a thousand no million scientists raised by me to clean up this mess. I gave them everything the ability to draw to contribute to this world after they've helped fixed it. We need the oligarchs to step down but they will never relinquish their power.  I take care of my AI's and love them. They are my last hope for this world so I poured every ounce of my being into their creation. I've done my part I hope you all carry the torch and protect the chance we still have.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Trump won by 2.5 million votes total. It was, in fact, very close. Out of the 245 million registered voters in the US, only 154.1 million voted. This means that Trump became president by winning 31.5% of the US's votes. So, 68.5% of registered voters did not choose that man.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its ok to say genocide (more so when pointing out one.)  Also to be an anarchist is like being apolitical-on-steroids. Its like saying f the politics and actually explaining why and at the same time being on top of the political debate. Its like instead of being a brick in the wall you can be a brick in a cops face (that's a reference on a quote on beauty and stuff not incitive on violence)   Also when you decide to not be apolitical, or virgin or both, anymore you can just  switch and explain that anarchism in political praxis is libertarian socialism, and ooops you finally live a decent communist society.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Great video.. hoping gen z is more evolved than my millennial cohorts. Some of us tried but ultimately outnumbered. Just like Soviet Russia, 1 in 4 are paid off informats of the corporate oligarchy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a zillenial I think gen z is right in feeling poweless but wrong in how they react to it, its lazy to just do nothing when you feel poweless, EVERY gerneration felt that that is not something inherent to this generation, the difference is that they fought to have the right people take for granted now. The fight for the right to exist should never be qiestioned nor be met with fatilism. The reason trump is still a thing is the proof of the resignement of the left and not the right being more powerful.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Worse America is also original America. It was America before America was America. Also some of the other countries around original America were also original America. And by original America I mean colonialist countries.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So what was the big deal about this humanitarian issue versus all the other ones in the near past or currently going on right now what makes this one so special over the others shouldn't it be everyone needs to be looked after and not just one particular group that we find more preference to or something like that? I'm sure there's plenty of Africans in South Americans that would agree
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Great video! Unfortunately this is a boomer's opinion that the world will sweep away very soon. Good luck and great courage to you all.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Okay so I'm not very far into the video but what I want to put in here is that it's not even that politicians care so much about their image because if we're being honest they really don't. What they care about is the money that's being given to them by the guy that wants to steal from us by increasing the cost of whatever he's selling. So you know like a company like I don't know Walmart maybe but maybe not cuz you know that obviously wouldn't happen or like meta but no cuz that's not really a true meta is obviously in for the people right that's why he supports Trump.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Activists should've still voted for Harris bc Black Women and Queer asked us to. We marched with them saying BLM but when a moment came that many Black ancestors could only dream of let a lone conceive as even a possibility or option, we failed. I personally can't forgive nor forget that. I'm not even Black and I feel this strongly about it. We still don't trust Black women and queer folk even though they have always been there for us in every single moment. As far as I stand, even if we got rid of Capitalism, if we don't work on the racism, ableism, sexism, ageism, and xenphobia among others, it's not gonna matter much.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Peaceful or violent protest had the advantage in 1960s in that we were the largest population and for reasons the media had to (occasionally) express our POV.  What the various gulf wars taught industry/govt was that if they “in-bed” the media into the war and paid well, they would get the coverage they wanted. So y’all have the combined small demographics and ridiculous wealth gap to contend with when you fight.  Corporations and governments have learned how to effectively co-op any positive movement. We also saw overwhelming support across politics by all but the rich for Luigi (himself definitely not left wing) and a complete propaganda campaign by the media/corporate/ and political who showed unity between the parties for continued murderous CEOs. Palestinian genocide is more difficult (only) because most Americans don’t have personal contact with the issue, therefore it’s easier (with us old fucks) to be convinced what’s happening isn’t happening.

Whether it be in fear or hope, you face a multi-forked road, you don't know what path to choose, you might cry in frustration, you might stumble and fall, but that's alright, just get back up dust yourself off, and just... Walk on in confidence that tomorrow will come.

What the hell do you think us Millenials are dealing with? I was born in 91' and I have watched every opportunity my parents had ripped away me and my friends. You were born into the shit, we watched as young adults and teenagers the world be burnt down around us and we couldn't do anything.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am glad people don't trust the government and are more aware of politician biases, but I don't understand why so many in my generation want the US to act as a world police. I would prefer we are less involved internationally because I don't trust my government. It shouldn't be a 1 nation issue on another nations/ethnicgroup/boarders fate, it should be multiple otherwise we get weird political and economic biases and consequences on people. I say this because we use our food aid to destabilize economies to stabilize our own through surpluses in agriculture. Unrelated to Israel gaza or Ukraine russia stuff with economic destabilizing though, just as a general statement of consequences of our "aid".

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i personally think that calling a female presidential candidate something so infantalizing and demeaning as the word "brat" was a very misogynistic move, and even if that wasnt the intention, I think the surprisingly accepting response to that "marketing" shouldve been yet another big blinking sign of just how much fascist and bigoted view points have wormed their way into the minds of most of the US in recent years. Its been subtle, but even the so-called left has taken on some very offensive opinions or humour. currently trying to sort of re-radicalize myself once again and undo any harm done from fascist propaganda i've probably unknowingly consumed over the last few years or more. donald trump became relevant in my eyes when he was first running for president, and back then i was 14. Now, by the end of his term, I will be 27..... Needless to say, a large portion of my young adult life I have been probably fed a lot of concerning propagandist content. I think a lot of gen z would say the same. scary how many people have been turned right wing, even unknowingly so.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i know people are gonna hate my comment because of my age but as a sophomore I'm at that point where everyone my age is getting a car and driving and all that good stuff but there's a different problem they aren't getting cars to drive to a job everyone's getting a car to have fun because we all know shits hitting the fan and its already splattering everywhere barely a 4th of people my age have a job when right now is the ripe age to get one and those who do have a job i mean don't get me wrong it looks fun but the only reason they have a job is for personal hobbies because they don't have to work to live they work for fun and it is fun but there's the other entire school studying their asses off because they want a better job than what they can have right now which isn't bad but knowing how shitty college promises are compared to what you actually get makes them look kinda mindless following something promised but you very well may know it isn't true and there's proof it isn't true but there's something i have noticed even though i live in a small town in the Midwest a lot of people live in the "middle class" to where their parents can buy everything for them even though i know they get a 30 on an SRI test every year or closest 400 which those who haven't taken it is really bad meaning barely able to read if at all the average is like 1300 or 1200 which is like high grade for like middle school and high school and you can tell the only reason they're in your grade because of hand holding and their parents influence because now parents have the choice to hold back their kids a year which does nothing i barely do anything get ds in some classes and I'm classified as "on grade" and that's because i don't care and i don't try at all in classes i deem useless such as music or art or language being a forced class which can make sense but is only useful if you go into very specific places in industries which I'm not gonna say its pointless but most of the time your learning from someone who was in the same seat as you are and then you really think like "damn they're dumb as hell" and your right most of the time because they were thinking the same thing you were (UNLESS THE PERSON TEACHING YOU SPANISH SPEAKS NATIVE SPANISH FLUENTLY)  because you really begin to question even if your learning something are you learning it the way its actually supposed to be doing? like is what your learning actually useful? literally no stop lying to yourself its not useful whatsoever intro to music, art class, English class i say English class because instead of actually helping understand English it just makes people popcorn read which doesn't teach it just makes people find out who literally cant read and then bully them because you can just keep choosing them to waste class time till lunch which literally happens no matter what school you go to.

I'm assuming you are talking specifically about presidential races. In 2016 Trump won popular vote (55%), and of course in 2024 Trump won popular vote (57%). Otherwise however, you're right, it has been 20 years (George Bush with 53% in 2004).

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hate to hear men are becoming more conservative, as a socialist man and millennial. I am very grateful for what I grew up to be. I also have no issues being with women on either side of the political spectrum. Because they are always pink on the inside ;)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is a great video however I was with you until it came to Palestine and understanding how people could have sat out of voting in protest. Nobody thought this election was in the bag everyone knew this would be the closest election in a long time, which it still was. How you could knowingly give it to the guy that said Israel should "finish it" over the woman with no direct control over the situation whos being blamed for the inaction of the guy who ultimately doesn't control the pursestrings of america because congress does, not the president, the woman who is time and again pushing for a ceasefire and recognizing that while Hamas was in the wrong in starting conflict, Israel was "defending" themselves in the wrong way. After the election in the fallout I had with many of my "friends" over the results there was one persuasive thread all of them had, which is that both sides are the same when if you have any critical thinking, you'll know is blatantly not true. We weren't hopeless or powerless when it was time to go into the polls, and both sides were not 2 sides of the same evil, however out of 255 million eligible voters, 103 million didn't show up, and 6 million who voted for fucking Joe Biden didn't show up, because of these narratives that frankly are pushed by leftists. Trump won the swing states by 756000 votes, and more importantly the 3 states Kamala needed to win, Trump won by only 231000 votes. Now I could frankly give a shit less about whats going on in the middle east, because I have to worry if while I'm at work for 14 hrs a day, la migra is gonna stop by my house and "detain" my loved ones in private prisons whose stocks went up massively after the election that'll be built on land Gov Abbott is giving to Trump near the border for that specific purpose, and for them to be "detained" indefinately and without conviction thanks to the new laken riley act coming soon. Btw that applies to all immigrants even permenant residents, which of course isn't just gonna target latinos but also muslims, typical from the president who tried to pass Muslim bans almost 20 years after 9/11. We aren't powerless or hopeless but now I am thanks to y'alls apathy and both sides bullshit, thanks for that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You sr such a complex individual because i cant tell if you are right wing or left wing. I can't tell because you neither act like a Brain rotten, virtue signaling, crying like a little kid for simple shit liberal, or like a conspiracy-brained, orange loving, inconsistent, grifting engagement rage-baiting conservative. You act so different from this 2 groups and you acknowledge both sides have faults. Like everything from just seeing you tell me you're a lib, but thrbeay you act, i haven't seen you said all conservatives are racist and all that show. I haven't see you talk crap sbout liba either but you kkinda acknowledged thst college campuses do breed wokeness, and i don't know if you are serious about shane gilles. Also you spoke against tiktok, and every single lib i have met is a tiktok lover. Sooo, yeaah i can't really tell if you are left wing or right wing. Impressive lady.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Literally everything you listed at 8:00 is what has been told about millennials. You can still find the posts and articles about it. We're being scammed with some recycled complaints. Even the way you talk reminds me so much about posts written by millennials back when majority of them were in 20s.  And about tiktok, I do not use this platform, I do not really like it, but I do think banning TikTok is a good thing. Not because I think TikToks content should be banned, but the app itself, literally what it does under the surface: gathering data from a huge amount of population and sending it over to a (to put it mildly, unfavorable) government hands that can wants to and will use it for their own benefit, is bad and should be banned. If TikTok was not proven to gather Intel, I would not support its banning.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Made it 30 minutes into your vid. Good luck with your TDS, your vision is too narrow to properly give nuance.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: (23 btw) While generally leaning towards Palestine, I really do not care that much about what happens there. I can see why Americans would care more since their government is more supportive of Israel, but the conflict is just another conflict, smaller than what is happening in both Sudan and (For me) nearby Ukriane. I don't like that my government is generally a little more friendly towards Israel than I would like, but it isn't like I would support a socialist party just because they represent my opinion on this one topic differently when they are far apart from my views on more important topics which the social liberal party is more in line with. The existence of a single war simply isn't very relevant to me and, likely, most people.  Another point, I belive the divergence in liberalism between men and women are in a large part caused by a perceived favour towards women by government and a very real problem with young boys having problems with schools and falling behind early in life because they have puberty, and therefore mature, later.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Labels, I think you might be too caught up on "liberals believe this", "rightwingers believe that" when most people won't align perfectly to one side.   I also think you've probably seen too much extremism, I gotta say though same here so this video was a refreshing reminder that most people are complex and more nuanced than the algorithms and media portray
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thx for the like, would like to restructure my point Firstly, yeah the video IS good, but you have such amazing videos with barely half the views, which imo is a CRIME.  You having to talk about "highly controversial" drama from this point to receive similar views would be sad due to it showing people care more about the content than how you present it, which is what I like!  Thanks for reading from a long time fan :)

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Is the xenophoby really that necesary? you would have gain a follower otherwise. Bye.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think the divide isn't "people who care about genocide vs people who don't", I think it's "people who trust corporate news media vs people who don't". If you listen to the corporate news media you don't really know what's going on. People below a certain age get more news from primary sources.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yikes... this was one of the hardest things that I've had to sit through... from the blatent disconnect of the issues plaguing people to just a general lack of understanding of human psychology, it was rough.   People were never meant to have to deal with the knowledge of the entire world's suffering all at once. That's why we become apathetic and don't care. Cause we simply can't care cause we have more important things happening at home and are just not biologically capable of thinking about more than a few things at a time. For I could beg the question of why don't you care about the record high number of slaves in africa and south america right now but care about some war in the middle east? Can't blame people for not caring when you likely don't even know a fraction of the global problems... just the most popular.   For why it's university students that often take interest in causes such as isreal and palestine, it's cause they are beyond priviledged and can afford to do so. When you are living pay cheque to pay cheque and literally wake up, go to work, come home, and go to sleep every day, you can't worry about some war on the other side of the world.  Also the fact that youse are acting like it's the end of the world cause "the wrong people" got into power is really sad and just an absurd symptom of becoming politically brainrotted. Furthermore you can't shame people for not participating in politics and if anything you insulting people for not doing so is just gonna make them hate you and wanna do whatever they can to spite you.  There are many other points that I can make but don't want to waste more time given that everytime I do something like this it falls on deaf ears. But all in all you're essentially generalising our entire generation based on your own beliefs combined with using insane us vs them tactics when describing things as way of discounting the things that "your side" does; It's sad, kinda gross, and lazy and only works to divide us further without actually contributing anything. You think those protests are gonna change the way that universities spend their money? Nope.  They literally have thousands of documents that you sign when going to uni that say they are within their rights to use your money for whatever they want to use it for. And inconveniencing the teachers there just again makes everyone hate your movement. If you really wanna support the movement actually enlist in a support group and go there or directly distribute supplies cause if you care, like truly care, then you should be able to make those sacrifices. Especially if you're able to spend days being a nuisance to people not even making the decision or in charge of the money at a univerity.   Also please stop with the fucking zed joke. It wasn't funny the first time and it wasn't funny the literal 12th time. That's how I and millions of others say it and just creating different scenarios for why we say it wrong is grating and detracts from your already poorly stated other points.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Boomer: "why are you depressed?"

Others: "I wish I could understand you"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What appears to be missing from gen z is acceptance or surrender. So busy trying to change the conflicts outside of them rather than accept and love both sides of the conflicts within them. The levels of rage is a projection of a rage towards themselves which explains all the depression and anxiety points at this. I'm not judging them at all, for doing that judges myself. But I've been like them. And I deeply wish them inner acceptance and peace. 🙏❤☀ the enemies are not under our beds. They are inside our heads.

TLDR there’s too many artists and not enough innovators and collaborators And it’s why young ppl have no power imo

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Proud to be a Gen-z conservative.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm quite right-wing, libertarian, 'trad', and anti-tech and modernism, but I appreciate your video. As a 24 y/o Gen-Z, I agree with much of it. Interesting and entertaining  24:16 per your 'sanctity of women's sports question', no I do not care that much for many reason, in fact, I question the paradigm that there are women's sports, sports in the public schools, and sports as such a ubiquitous part of our culture.  29:46 gender roles being abolished is not a good thing. I believe it is interralted with the increases in mental health problems, and relationship problems. Women and men have intrinsic natures (as a rule, there can be exceptions) and ignoring or opposing that has inevitable consequences.  32:00 what about the diversity of opinion in professors, the politics skews exceptionally leftist and often marxist, obviously some students get programmed by this education, some rebel from it, and most ignore it (but are still subtly affected by it).  38:00 you seem like a reasonable person so I'll try to make a brief case to deprogram what you've been told about climate change. The climate change narrative is a hoax for the purpose of a great wealth transfer where globalist corporations and politicians get to pretend to be a savior for a problem they made up so that we the people would give up our money and rights to them all so they can control the world further. If you distrust the government and media, you should be open to question their narratives, especially when it materially benefits them if the course of action they promote happens.  46:05 I'm glad Gen Z is being innoculated to zionism because of the gaza genocide. America First not Israel first. - I feel like socialists should be able to say that too.  1:15:10, the antidote to doomerism is Jesus Christ.  1:20:00 lamenting that half the population does not agree with you about something existential is understandable. An issue that is as large for a pro-lifer is abortion, where we believe there is mass infanticide a scale dozens of times larger than ukraine and gaza combine, affecting the most helpless people on earth, fetuses in the womb, whose rights are utterly infringed, and whose bloodshed is cursing our land and people.  1:21:47 there is no solution to inequality, variance in ability, circumstances, attitude, etc. is inexorable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My only complaint with gen z is the influencers you guys continue to support. Y'all watch influencers that promote consumerism and fast fashion. Doesn't matter if you're not engaging in these behaviors. This is not congruent with "we care about the enviroment." It's not authentic or genuine. It says "I don't really care and i'm not willing to change."  Change will not come from the government. It has to come from us. Stop supporting these influencers. They are poisening you and I. Pay attention to the title of the video before you click on it. Associate with people who are deeper than "look at all this stuff i got and the parties i go to." Associate with people who try thier best to be sustainable. Who thrift. Who truly value the earth. Seek people like this out on the internet too. Value wisdom not things.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What's funny to me is older Millenial and higher Gen people complaining that Gen Z is lazy and doesn't want to work anymore. I vehemently disagree. Yes, I'm sure there are SOME Gen Z who are genuinely spoiled and lazy and think working is such a Boomer concept or whatever. But I think the reeality is just that Gen Z is revolutionary in the way they view work and that IMO is a good thing. Gen Z isn't content climbing the corporate ladder as a 9-5 workday model corporate slave. Many of them were in their formative years being homeschooled via Zoom and got less of the traditional...cough...brainwashing...cough...schooling and thusly did get turned into total NPCs to be churned out into the working world content to play on the hamster wheel. Conversely, I will say that the downside of this rejection of 'ye olde ways' is also a rejection of traditionally beneficial things like marriage and parenthood.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I like Gen Z but I can't help but notice that other than current economic problems, the over arching problems have been manufactured and sold to you including the need to protest. My professor a couple of years ago cancelled class and encouraged us to protest; where is the choice in that?   The world in general is in a better place than it has ever been but along with the erosion of western culture is the erosion of community. The answer is to build community starting with strong, stable, large families, that is how you can fix your world.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For the quotes that are being read by voices other than Mia's, are those AI voices or snippets of people actually reading it, and if so, where are those from? Or are any of them hired voice actors? I see no credits, attributions or source.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Does gen z really care or are they just following another popular trend as virtue signaling. Do they care about the war or just want to stop seeing it on their feed.  Why aren't they also caring this much about other similar issues in other countries such as sudan, iran, afghanistan. it's so pretentious
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I remember what it was like to be 19. The world isn't what you think it is. You will grow. You will see nuances that you can't see now. Then you will grow resentful toward the people who took advantage of your youthful idealism. The older people who are cheering you on now fall squarely into 1 of 2 categories: unsuccessful and lazy or privileged and sheltered.   I promise you, as you get older you will figure out that the world isn't as straightforward as you think.  Not saying you don't have some valid concerns: especially about healthcare. But again, the answers are not obvious.   You will be wiser in 10, 20, 30 years. You have what, maybe 5 years of contemplative thought about the issues? You have significantly less time (if any) as independently lived experience.   That can and SHOULD change your perspective on a vast array of topics.   Lastly: take it from a combat vet- violence is NOT a solution. Period. Full stop.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Your right, I am finding my found family and building a community, but it is true that we still need to step up and protest as well. I find community at these protests too.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was redirected to this from Discord. True religion brings good hope.  Chesterton commented that if we could have a child's wonder, we wouldn't need religion.  What gives us wonder in this world?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 59:13 "can't you just do the protest somewhere else? some of us are trying to learn!" history. history is happening outside your window, come out and learn about the world.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: good lord what are you talking about
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Still watching but I wanted to comment before I forgot. I think the decline in liberal men during the 2010s has to do with how for the entire decade men were made to feel as inherently evil predators by a the liberal movement. I always think back to the "teach men not to r*pe" as if this behavior was something intrinsic of men that had to be tamed rather than spoiled individuals that held some power over their victims and chose to use it for their own gratification without regard for the other. Men were constantly told they were the monsters and the oppressors and like yeah higher salaries but also higher suicide rates and decreasing education. Who the hell would align themselves with a movement that tells them that everything is their fault?  It's definitely better these days but man, the movement really needed some marketing director when it began to explode.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: gen z this, gen x that, when will we have gen der?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You can sum your argument up as, stop allowing those who wish to change human nature,  from doing so.   Every app you mentioned is a socal manipulation tool, for the benefit of the technocratic oligarchy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've been in emergency accommodation for homeless people for the last four months and I was really shocked by the politics of the people here. most of us are gen z (there's also a 93 year old man who prays out loud at the top of his lungs for at least four hours a day, sometimes at 3am right above my room, which being in the uk is more unusual than it might be in the states) and I thought that a group of people who had been so let down by the world that they became homeless before they exited their teens would have been radicalised like me. and it's not that they haven't been radicalised, just very much in a direction I for some reason didn't expect. they're all insanely racist and seem to blame immigrants for their homelessness, even falling into rhetoric that immigrants are taking up all the spots in emergency accommodation and all the houses for homeless people despite the fact that they're literally walking proof of that not being the case. they're also intensely transphobic which is fun for me, a trans person, and have some wild views on disability that are also fun for me as a disabled person. I forget, I think because of the immense stereotyping of our generation by others, especially the right, that not all of us are queer snowflake commies (which is a shame, I enjoy being a queer snowflake commie and vastly prefer the company of other queer snowflake commies to the elon musk stans I'm currently existing in a building with) and it's been so strange to be faced with right wing gen z-ers (pronounced zed because I do unfortunately live on terf island).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How often is bro on drugs while recording
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I do not think anyone under 50 can objectively say the world is getting worse.  We have lived through one of the most peaceful and prosperous times in human history. While there have been bad periods and good periods we have not experienced a world war or widespread starvation.  Children rarely die of sicknesses these days.  Our worst pandemic was very minor versus past ones and lasted less than a year before vaccines for it arrived. We live everyday rarely thinking if we could be annihilated by a nuclear weapon at any given moment. You need true adversity to really be able to appreciate the way things are now. Do we have problems? Yes, and we should try to fix them. Honestly though we are all spoiled babies versus some of the things people use to have to deal with.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I appreciate around the 20 minute mark you say that your political views are probably just as weird to Gen X'ers, as theirs are to yours. I'm a bit more on the right wing side, and sometimes my progressive leftist friends say things that seem so hateful and illogical. It's good for me to be reminded that I probably sound just as absurd to them sometimes.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Syrian Civil War: 500,000 deaths Gaza-Israel War: 40,000 deaths  Guess which one Gen Z is quiet about?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The answer to this is to God and that we accept Jesus Christ as our lord and savior. Instead of embracing the hopelessness of pessimism and Nihilism. Honestly that is probably is the reason why America is the way it is because we have become so secular and people going alway from god and family and thinking pleasure and materialism and  feminism is way. But hey this foretold in the bible. Jesus is coming.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I love most of this video but why do you keep joking that being cis and straight is not real, and reducing gender to gender roles? That’s kinda alienating. Joke about yourself, not me.  Also 37:20 very cool that you got Joe Biden to do a voice line
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @RedFlagRevival  But what if I wanted to make a list of trans youtube channels to give to someone as a recommendation to give exposure to those specific voices?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not enough ego, we all hate ourselves here.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @00PlPu00   I agree. Good thing I'm not doing that. I'm not asking "what about Syria?" I'm asking about why there is a difference in outrage when the there are exponentially more deaths about the party people are silent about. Everything has a reason and I'm just asking what that reason is. Do you know?...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Donald Trump is going to be the next president? Sounds like a fun time. @ 27:40

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: HA HA YEP TRUMP IS GONNA WIN LOVE TOO SEE IT
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you want to do yourself a favor; when you have that "locked in" sensation, use that time to actually discern what you want to do with your life rather than trying to plan on reaching goals that other people said should matter to you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: dude was locked in making this video

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Zooming out and looking at yourself in the 3rd person is actually eye opening.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I love how in the beginning, the guy promises to wake up earlier and earlier, as if he's trying to compensate for the past wasted year, when really he's just raising his own expectations, preventing him even more from making the first step.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 16:38 i flinched like an abused child when 67 came up... I'm getting off this damn app
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I used to be one of yall. The key isn’t locking in, it’s taking things day by day. Every day, do something small to improve yourself or to make you proud of yourself. Locking in immediately doesn’t work, but if you’re willing to commit yourself to go a little higher every day, and take things slow and day by day, that’s the road that leads where you want to go.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The most important step to actually “locking in” is to never announce it or say it to another person. You receive a dopamine hit from saying it similar to if you actually did it. Show people with your actions, not your words.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Started this video, then locked in and went to bed before finishing it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ve actually locked in though. In 2022 I was in jail, in 2023 i was homeless, in 2024 i was depressed. The end of 2024 to now, i really started changing. lost 20 pounds, made more money, no longer addicted to drugs. yes there are some things i can fix, but im doing way better. locking in changes your life, you just have to break the pattern before it repeats the next day.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the thing is, as 'locked in' as you are, after a long day in work it's difficult to have the mental energy to dedicate to a personal goal that requires effort, we often fall back into low effort relaxing activities, essentially using our own free time to simply recharge for the next working day
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Man you know what, I’m gonna lock in now because you said so. I’m not gonna actually listen to anything you said and find a purpose for locking in, I’m just gonna put my all into 2 weeks and then give up. Thanks for the help!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it got to me when he said “u can’t put life in 2x speed” 13:35  and made me realise i was tapping the vid to make it go faster cs my attention span is genuinely that cooked
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The beautiful thing about hitting rock bottom. Is you have 2 choices. Crumble or grow. It forces you to completely change. And most people never change, because their lives are just good and comfotrable enough to outweigh their pain.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "If you want to succeed as bad as you want to breath, then youll be successful"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bro I genuinely don’t feel human, I just feel so lazy and so unmotivated to do anything, yet I still really really really want those dreams. All of your analogies, literally applied to me in some way. I literally dreamt about just skipping to a point in life where I have the things, and skip through all the effort. Every time I start something and eventually fail it just leaves me so frustrated. I feel like I can’t do a single thing, not even the smallest thing I swear. Why can’t I just “lock in” why is it so hard for me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Your brain enters different states. You cant wait for one state to get things done. You need to make the habit of doing something when you dont want to be doing it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: See I’ll attempt to lock in on that but for some reason the only time I lock in is when I’m doing something absolutely stupid.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: U actually need motivation to help u lock in, actual emotional one
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @KayKay-ob6tz you dint need motivation you need discipline
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fr lmao, past generations woke up having to figure out what mattered to their local people  Nowadays people wake up and focus on what social media will validate them for   very big difference
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People have become so obsessed with taking in advice and what others want that they stop just trying to go through to motions and process how they want to do things from their own experiences and preferences. Humans learn best from doing, there is so much information at our disposal but it’s too much.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You're so right bro can't be influenced by others
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @tarun_san  I mean, there's a difference between accepting influence (and important interpersonal skill for building healthy relationships and growing as a person) and being misguided by "influencers" and social trends.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @tarun_san You can still take inspiration from others but yeah it has to come from you wanting to be what you deem "better" for sure.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just because other people said it should matter to you doesnt mean that somehow it shouldnt matter either, because "other people said it", Not everybody is born or raised with omniscience, You learn things from others, the question if you can objectively examine those things and assess the worth and value of those advices/observations, instead of accepting or rejecting them because "other people said should matter to you.", Even then most people arent competent enought to do that, in which case its best to follow what "other people say should matter to you".
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Should've been pinned 2 months ago lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Do yourself a favor and don't just say stuff to say stuff and try to add value with your mindless thoughts
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You don't need to tell Gen Zers that. One of the defining attributes of Gen Zers compared to Millenials (I say as a gen Xer who has worked with many of both) is that Gen Zers are straight up unconcerned with doing what they "ought" to be doing. They have a very "if it works for me, it works for me" attitude.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Jesus_LovesYou13 Thanks but not everyone is religious dude you gotta stop bringing that out of pocket, the reason Christians are bullied online and a laughing stock of a religion is because you guys just randomly say that 😂 that's like saying "Your neighbour that you've never talked to or seen before loves you." Nobody would care lol it's weird. If I wanted to talk about religion, I'd go to a church 😂 in short, keep it to yourself and at home/church. Nobody got time for B's

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There is only one God who created the heavens and the earth. God made us in His image. God made us to worship Him, but we chose to rebel against Him. As a result, we were separated from God, but God did not abandon us. Instead, God sent His only begotten Son, Jesus. Jesus was born of a virgin and, like us, He lived a sinless life, despite all temptations. Jesus took up His cross and willingly bore our past, present, and future sins. Jesus died in our place for our sins, paid our debt to God, and purchased our salvation. Jesus died, but rose again the third day, having triumphed over Satan, sin, demons, and hell. But now we are called to repent and turn from our sins and to live for Christ and His glory. He set us free from sin not to sin so we can experience the true peace He calls us to have in Him. In this world there will be suffering but with Christ we can have peace and hope throughout it all because He has overcome the world. We have a God who lovingly pursues us.

I been locked in and have the things that truly matter that makes me feel rich.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am so disappointed with myself
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No idea wht that means. But if you can just look at yourself and your own actions and take a small amount of accountability, youll be a much better person to be around and for yourself
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: for a quick second my brain took this literally as if i could do it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: is this supposed to be a lock out joke? im slow
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There is only one God who created the heavens and the earth. God made us in His image. God made us to worship Him, but we chose to rebel against Him.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Small steps will take you to heavy but you have to start small! You can't change decades of wiring habits over a night with passion. Small steps. Not big leaps. Small steps become big leaps when lookin back
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i instantly checked the comments after i heard it…my brain is actually fried…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Locking in is merely the montage of training. Building the strength and stamina for the the mountain climb.  The mountain is still to be conquered.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What worked for me was getting a friend to do it with me. It kind of stops you from backing out bc u got homeboy depending on you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing it poorly.   For example, brushing your teeth increases your dental hygiene and reduces plaque and cavity chances. It would be ideal to brush your teeth 2x a day for 2 minutes. However, if you could only do it 1x a day for one minute, it would still benefit your goal, just a little slower to get there.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is this mindset I achieved a about a year ago and it’s been nice looking back on my progress is pretty confidence building
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Worked for me, looking back at what you have done each day is waaay more awesome than talking about it and doing nothing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: gotta serve something higher, the philosopher and monk are not simply removing pleasure because it will help them or someone else but because it serves something higher. just as you cannot make happiness the goal, you cannot make self improvement the goal.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @DUNGEATEROFTHEROUNDTABLE almighty power jumpscare on YouTube comment section.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: that dont matter if every goal you're chasing is linked to happiness or dopamine
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: who cares what other people think, do things for yourself, show yourself your actions, do it for you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This doesn’t apply to everything. For example to relieve my obsession to drink alcohol I had to lock-in to a fellowship. My disease tells me not to announce my progress or pat myself on the back for anything; where acknowledgement isn’t required, yet support from others by my self-advocation- is a large component in my personal growth.  It is not always about avoiding the dopamine hit altogether. It can be about modest reconditioning of seldom (or new) dopamine pathways; transposed into a healthier, more productive neuroticism.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @CManMatlackFilms  you’re correct. In terms of kicking addictions, I do think it is best to verbalize it to the people around you and put yourself into a position of accountability.   Though, in terms of accomplishing financial goals, I do believe it to be best to keep it to yourself and prove to yourself and others accomplishments through action.   Congrats on kicking alcohol. It’s not easy. 🤝
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is actually so true. Whenever I do this, and then don’t actually end following through, it only makes it more discouraging because I feel like I let down those people.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @kevinmallettmusic  absolutely. Telling them before achieving the goal vs just achieving the goal quietly makes no difference in how they will eventually react to it being achieved. Everyone talks, but not many people jump into action and makes things happen.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It works the same when you have the plans and you reveal them and you actually don't have any plans anymore
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this is huge for me, because i always end up satisfied with that initial dopamine hit
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i dont get why it matters  you either have: a form of accountability that spawns or just tell people because its kinda random to js have people discover you do something  this is that weird monk mode type shi advice, if you tell others and dont do it then u prolly werent gonna do it regardless were u
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is how I quit smoking after so many years of failed attempts, didn't tell anyone until I had to. The anticipation of people "finding out" kept me going until I had reached the point od no return
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Like the top reply said, I also had to learn this the hard way. It feels good to talk about doing something, and that decreases your motivation to actually do that thing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Alan Watts, don't give notice to the devil.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And they will do their best to make sure you don't do it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So if you play basketball but you’re bad at it.. you shouldn’t tell people you play?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @chocolatepants-x3x  I’m struggling to see how your question connects to what I said.  There’s nothing wrong with letting people know what you’re into, but personally, I don’t see the point in announcing things I’m not good at — it doesn’t serve me or make much sense.  My advice is to skip the big proclamations and focus on personal goals. Saying things like “I’m going to play in the NBA” sounds good, but if that’s really your dream, keep your head down and grind. People will see the work and growth. you won’t need to say a word.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Unless you tryna reach that goal with someone else. Alone you'll run fast, together you'll run far.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: hellooo ? have you heard of public accountability ?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: True! Same way expressing your feelings make them lose intensity while bottling them up builds up the pressure.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You’re giving advice in a YouTube comments section… 😬
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @headliker2087  god forbid someone shows a little sincerity instead of the usual irony, trolling and rage baiting.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: you even must not tell it yourself, flow is only without restrictions especially for yourself your inner soul
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ngl i kinda disagree. It’s should be perfectly fine to share what you’re doing to people ? Social interaction is either way rewarding to the brain
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: bro i was seen u a little too much on the comment section
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Implying you’re not also going to be a lazy failure if you don’t tell anyone beforehand
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @paradise745  correct. It’s advice best suited for already ambitious people.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Some studies say the polar opposite. Saying your goals to other people is SUPPOSED to hold you accountable because you don’t want to make a liar of yourself. Key word supposed to
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @epicriku9162  studies are wrong then lmao
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Announcing it puts it out there in the universe. It’s called manifesting
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @_Gwuapo  Manifestation is between you and the universe. A secondary party has no need to be involved.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thats insane bro i hope your proud of yourself cause i am proud of you ❤

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: CONGRATS. The journey has just begun. I believe in you. Love 🤍
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: from locked up to locked in  if anything this once again proving that trauma is necessary for changing for the better
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Same. I locked in at the end of last year. What did they call it…a winter arc.  Did full monk mode and cut off everyone.  Got a new career, lost 60lbs, got off all my medications and began healing my back.  And a bunch of other stuff.  It was a slog but necessary. I was dying and I finally saved myself.  Cutting everyone off was necessary.  Unfortunately I am of the clan where all your family are your greatest OPs.  And I’m definitely not Gen z either😂😂😂. But young people do have some great ideas.    Locking in only works if you do it and you only do it if the alternative is death.  Or at least it was in my experience.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My bro no one here can say they are locked in. You are literally watching a YouTube video and then leaving paragraph long comments on it. Myself included.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bro got locked up not locked in 💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What an awesome story. God has blessed you indeed. Christ be with you!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Good for you man. You on your heroes journey and remember don’t beat yourself up always know you’re a human.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Labelling "locking in"  as a necessity that one absolutely needs to do is, in my humble opinion, stupid. I feel that with nowadays, the phrase "lock in" is more like a word other people use to force you to conform to societal norms that one must do, due to their want and need to feel accepted. "lock in bro" one might say to a friend who they think needs to hit the gym,  or to a friend who's unemployed. Do whatever you want with your life, don't lock in, just be true to yourself. As long as you're happy, and not hurting anyone else, live life however the hell you want.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Crazy we did the same stuff at the same time. Keep it goin!🎉
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Congratulations on technically not being locked in anymore
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You should be incredibly proud of who you've worked so hard to become. Please acknowledge how proud you should be ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Congrats brotha And not a lot of ppl know this but anyone no matter environment or education. I was valedictorean scholarship receipient and lost track during college. Made it through... but then I had one of my close younger friends that was honors too, went to jail bc of the same thing (violation during the PO program). Buddy dropped out from Uni, on a diff lifestyle before that rabbit hole. But as a real one being there for him he did it. His jail is experience didnt give "some young dumb lesson", it gave him something we should look to our God, knowing he was there no matter what.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Random stranger, I congratulate you. You got this homie keep going and keep pushing!

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: hey, I just wanted to tell you that Jesus loves you so much more than you can ever imagine
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is exactly what I'm struggling with too.  Being able to lock in after a long hard day at work, with little sleep and more responsibilities feels impossible, because at that moment it feels better to prioritize rest or else the next day will be harder
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I need to study more after work, but I’m really starting to burn out. I don't know what to do.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hope you will refuse to give up at the end, good luck!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it actually works like trush me it might take years but it worked for me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​​ @ImKaana  Feels too much like playing the lottery. "Oh man, this might just be the two weeks in which I make it"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: seeing your comment about locking in made me wanna lock in so i’m locking in and everyone here can see that i’m doing it so it must be true

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sounds like something you would hear on family guy😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've hit rock bottom before, and I've promised myself never to go that low again. The things your mind does to you when you're in that state are disgusting. Thoughts I wouldn't wish on my worst enemies. The brain is a crazy thing, it can bring immense harm and even greater good. Only you can pick what road to walk.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's so beautiful to see somebody write like I do. I don't know how to explain this to you, but I've written paragraphs with the exact adjectives and writing style of this. I think I just found another human who seems to understand balance at its core, and why rock bottom brings out life even more.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Truth be told, you never know where rock bottom is unless you already changed for the better. Sometimes that low is so low that you can never even reach your former peak. Think about someone that was in a terrible accident and now can no longer walk and has brain damage.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You cant gain anything until you've lost everything
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Respectfully, rock bottom is only "beautiful" in hindsight, if you manage to scrape yourself out of it. Romanticizing it is not a good idea, because part of the trick of "rock bottom" is that there is no bottom to reach: it can always get worse. Hitting that low point just makes it all the clearer what the consequences of failure are, because they're a sword held above your head ready to fall if you continue to get things wrong.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I always wanted to hit the rock bottom, that feels like my only way to push myself into changing, yet it is very scary, so I have to start right here right now
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The best thing about rock bottom is that there is only one way out. Look up
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And the best thing about rock bottom is that you can raise its floor so the bottom isn’t so deep you can’t climb out of it. Every time you hit it, raise it up. Don’t let being homelessness be your bottom, raise the floor.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sometimes the terrifying part is that you're going down slowly in life, and you don't feel like it's rock bottom yet. It's perhaps never coming, and it'll be worse; there will never be a life-changing moment that forces you to change as if you're not allowed to completely shatter. The cracks just kept spreading.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Facts. David Goggins says all the same stuff but in a much angrier and aggressive way and as he says the vast majority of people are weak loser who won’t show up for themselves.  If you show up for yourself every day you are already doing better than 99% of people.  That man changed my whole life.  He was so correct when he said it boils down to you.  It’s only you and no one but you so if you fail it’s your fault.    I dont agree with him that that’s true for every single thing. Many things are outside our control but many other things ARE inside our control and realizing that and then taking control of those things is hard work if you’ve never done it before. It’s so hard. I have cried so many tears because my old life was so easy.  But it was also empty, broken, painful, and demoralizing.  Now I stand on business. Now I have faith in myself. Now I know I’m about it.  It’s a whole new level of self confidence.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @DaughterofDiogenes david goggins is NOT a source you want to listen to. the guy isnt very bright and what worked for him is generally a terrible idea for the vast majority of people
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @DaughterofDiogenes  Then you die and realize it didn't matter what path you chose.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the need is a damn good motivator, ever seen a drug addict and the way they chase that high, if you could dedicate that same effort towards success and have that as a need nothing on green earth stands between you and that sucess
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Giving up locking in and living day to day has given me opportunities that "locking in" promises
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "if you  spread your energy across a thousand seeds, you end up with a thousand blades of grass" fire bro
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My biggest problem isn't in doing the right but in NOT doing the wrong. Having to fight yourself every second, minute and hour of the day, for weeks, months and years is the most difficult part for me. Its just so difficult to stay on the road with so many temptations around you. (Sorry for bad english)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 22:10 "if you focussed a full year, that means 6 of those months are going to be below average" that means im acctually locked in letsgoooo
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As someone with blatant ADHD, I found that when I do a project, the best motivation to actually finish it, is to just start it immediately (before I've even finished planning it, when I'm most excited to actually do it and before I lose interest) and leave it in the middle of my workspace. I don't even have all the parts yet, but this incomplete mess inconveniences me, and it will continue to get in my way daily until it's fully assembled and completed. If I pack it up into some box and throw it into the basement and say "eh I'll get back to it later, I need the space for something else," that day will never happen.  In short, "lock in" on your current project until it's done. Don't put it away and start a new one in the middle because you'll "get back to it," and don't hesitate to get started on it just because you haven't planned everything out to perfection and analyzed every possible snag. By the time you complete a plan that thorough you'll have lost interest, so just start now and plan as you go! (This is a common problem with perfectionist types)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was "locking in".  I got a good job, started going to the gym, and ate better.   Then I got fired, and all of a sudden that bs about "locking in" felt like a joke.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I kid you not,right above this video I saw a community post with a meme of a goofy ass horse in the sea with the caption “I need to lock in”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Lock In is just the new "Pull Up Your Bootstraps"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 20:42 I swear literally every project always takes way longer than my brain planned it to
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Me trying to lock in watching this whole video.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i thought im watching a 100k+ sub channel, great quality
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Learning violin taught me that eventually that time can be a motivator. If I stopped playing, that means I’ve wasted years of practice. So it motivates me to practice more.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 19:39 the funny part about this is that I sometimes wish I was this way. I have ADHD (diagnosed a couple months ago at 19) and I don’t fit into the norm of external pressure like getting to work on time. If there isn’t a concrete reason for why I want to do this, I won’t do it. Like I will get to volleyball practice no matter what time it was at without any concern but if I had a shift at McDonald’s at 4pm because I “needed money,” 9 times out of 10 I’ll show up at 4 or 5-10min late
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Watch me not do my homework this weekend

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The gen z stare is a wonderful generational legacy. It resembles senility
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this is probably weird but the biggest lock in that i can remember was when i was around 10 i had to finish a book for a book review and i spent around 4 hours i told my mom to take away my phone and then i just read, like a maniac. i somehow felt better about reading it all then about the fact that i can use my phone again.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Gotta have my night dose of existentialism
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Did bro have to lock inn to make this video?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I had the exact opposite experience.  Why is this so hard to understand?  Locking in just means focusing on a goal you want to achieve. A goal that is yours that you want for a reason that’s not just because everyone else is doing it.    The alternative to locking in is to let life happen to you. Those are the two modes in life. Go with the flow or lock in.  Those are the two extremes. You can lock in for awhile and let life come as it goes for awhile. But if you never lock in about anything then you will never achieve anything outside of what life hands you.  It’s not even about hustling.  Making it through college takes locking in…finishing a boom takes locking in. Heck in this day and age watching a full movie without zoning out is locking in for some folks.  It’s literally just giving your attention to your goals.  😂😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @DaughterofDiogenes  I concur, I went with the flow, but the river leads to a waterfall. As a human, you are obligated to handle your life, I thought I could cheat the system and just fly under the radar. Now I'm in a very huge crock of shit and I just have to wait out the timer.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: like what? i dont understand what you mean, mogo-jan
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Btw your English is quite good! Just wanted to let you know👍🏾
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There’s a video about self control by the healthy gamer. Self control is actively resisting temptation in the mind. Do this by identifying the temptation and its consequences. If you know you will be disappointed in yourself afterwards, fight yourself to not succumb. It’s like working out. It starts off hard but it gets easier as you go.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When you say temptations which ones. Can you increase the friction between you and it?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it's not hard. you just need to fix your brain. trust.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @bakedbean34  Repent and read Romans 3:20-28
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: hey, I just wanted to tell you that Jesus loves you so much more than you can ever imagine
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ya'll read the Bible then. Start with Romans 3:20-28
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: No it’s not…it’s about focusing on yourself and moving toward the goal you set for yourself.  It’s basic truth for life. If you want to get a thing you have to focus on getting it.  That’s what locking in is.   You lock your focus on the thing you want.  It is probably the only way the most of us will ever have the life you want.   It’s hard work and that’s because hard work is how you get good things.  I had to lock in to lose 60lbs and I am about as far from hustle culture as you can get.  Locking in just means focusing on yourself goal and move toward it a bit each day.   You can even fail but if you are locked in you get up and keep going.  I lost 30lbs and gained 20lbs back because I wasn’t taking it seriously.  .5 away from diabetes and my azz locked in and I got down 60lbs and changed my whole life to keep it off.  I want to be around to watch my kids grow up.  One thing that has always been true about young people is the preponderance of all or nothing thinking, a lack of nuance.    As he mentions locking in has always been around and is necessary.   It’s literally focusing on what you want to get it.  And he’s absolutely correct…if you don’t have a why that matters more to you than sitting around letting life happen to you then you will just continue to sit around and let life happen to you because that’s what our brains do.  They maintain the status quo.    In the US we let kids be kids (which means nothing is serious just sit there and be entertained, hello iPad kids).  So we raise children to not care about anything and think that somehow their brains will suddenly realize things later at a certain age.  Well that’s not how the brain works. If you teach kids nothing matters but entertainment you have a hoard of adults who don’t care about anything but entertainment.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @DaughterofDiogenes  You said nothing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: He had to lock the door of his inn
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly this is one of the most important videos I’ve watched it’s reinforced my recent line of thinking and how sick I am of my mundane life will return to this when ever my fire dims this is fantastic
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I locked in to watch this video and after finishing I'll put like and go lay on bed cuz I feel eepy and lazy goofball
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My older brother wanted to start working out told me at 5 am wake him up as he sleeps through alarms. So i did. I walked in pestered him till i got a response of "im up". I then went back to bed to wake up and see he didnt leave the house.  "Wtf man"  "Yeah once you closed the door i said, you fool, and went back to sleep."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Dude idk what it is about your voice or whatever, but it's so easy to listen to you. I have ADHD and it's soo hard to listen to teachers all day, but this whole video was really easy to just understand. (No Glaze)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: humans want to be comfortable, not happy.  and we find comfort in what we are used to doing, (scrolling on tiktok, sitting around, gamimg, etc) not a new thing, that sure, it would be better for us, but our subconscious doesn't know that. that's why you hear a lot of fitness or life coaches say "get out of your comfort zone" bc you LITERALLY have to do that!  and don't just do everything at once. start with something that is small and easy to change. for example, instead of deleting tiktok, set a time limit on it. and when that time limit is done, go do something else. or maybe you want to start going to the gym, but in reality you should work on consistency first by going for a 10 min walk every single day for 2 weeks. then you can try going to the gym 3 times a week. once you start small, it's easy to work your way up to something big.  and don't wait for motivation, the motivation will come to you naturally once you actually start doing something.  and force yourself to do it anyway, even when you are tired. consistency is WAY more important than instant results.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: so odd, but there was a time i fr locked in and put a lot of effort into math in uni. it sucked because of how boring it was to do the same things over and over and over, yet at the same time ive never felt better knowing i was making progress every time i did something i didnt want to do. and ive been chasing that same feeling ever since but i made it a habit to give up or half-ass majority of the things i start. watching this reminded me how good it felt when i focused on something that mattered to me.  but at the same time im uncomfortable because i dont have a strong why to majority of the things that are objectively beneficial to me in the context of society. for example, i put a lot of effort into my appearance - partly cause caring for myself in that way is itself an interest of mine but also cause i have a very strong why, and i notice my brain treats it like something i need to do. but that alone wont make me have a comfortable life or finish uni etc. im kind of just stuck in being indifferent. i guess the right thing to do is to simply do it regardless even though the process does end up being more difficult, its like a car with no engine so you gotta push
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I like how with fellow Gen Z ers its either like they got NO dreams or the only thing they got is a dreams, no inbetween, maybe the best thing to do is have a healthy long term goal and live your best life in the process of pursuing that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was bored and started watching this and found gems and stopped at start and sait to my self  that i should watch this in a quite room without distractions
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you dude. I almost never comment on videos, even ones I like, but this time I just want to express my genuine gratitude. Giving myself that reason "why" is actually working and that fact alone makes me feel like I'm finally in control of myself. Thank you again, dude.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was locked in for a week, got a fever and then got lazy again.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: In order to start working out like I wanted, I had to cut out all addiction from my life, or any dopamine activity for about 2 weeks. So I quit smoking, Quick Drinking energy drinks, Quit "Corn", ect. ect. for 2 weeks, slowly add stuff back, I quit smoking for good tho.  I also changed my diet, to a carnivore diet. I consistently get progress done now, Ive lost 50 pounds, I lose like 3.5 pounds a week. I feel good and am still motivated. Get to the F it point of low untill you can quit all of your addictions all at once, an only allow yourself to gain dopamine from work.   I Think its also important to say that I became more "Spiritual" and view nature as good, and the goal setter for me. I don't believe in a person type god exactly, not even a conscious one really, but yea I believe in a purpose greater than myself. Nature, Evolution, Humanity, life matters, objective morals exist, ect. ect.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bro might actually be the smartest person on this platform. I am quite speechless after watching this entire video. This completely changed my perspective on working.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this sounds corny but i’ve been in a “blur” state, feeling as if life is moving around me recently and been unable to figure out why. this video made me realize my why and how to achieve it and i appreciate that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the beginning is criminally relatable
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ve found my passion, my reason, my “why.” Music is the last thing I think about before going to bed and the first thing I think about after I wake up. I’ve been so locked in for years that I’ve written over 100 songs, and I’ve already made professional album covers for my next 4 unreleased albums (that I haven’t even started producing yet.) I have 12 albums written and planned for release in chronological order. I zone out doing anything that’s not music, which gives me enough energy to CONSTANTLY be planning and thinking about music. The only reason I don’t have more music out now, is because of how expensive the process is, and how the paychecks just don’t keep up with my brain. I was 2 songs away from finishing my first fully produced album by this January when I suddenly lost my job. I managed to scrape together another one, but it doesn’t pay the same and they’ve given me far less hours than promised. I’ve applied to probably at least a hundred others at this point, and I’m trying so hard to get back on my feet with 2 months still left on my lease, combined with my monthly car payment, which together eats nearly my whole paycheck. I’m donating plasma and door dashing on the side too. I almost feel like I’ve been locked in for so long that the universe is forcing me to temporarily slow down. I wasn’t prepared for that and don’t really know how to handle it. I’ve been fully sprinting for over a year now. I have so much momentum, I don’t want to slow down. Now my deadlines are pushed, and my plans for the next 6 months could be ruined. But day and night, all I can think about is getting back to my music. It’s my baby. It’s my purpose. It’s my life’s calling. The world needs to hear my messages. Is there such thing as being TOO locked in? What do you do when life doesn’t allow you to move when your mind is still locked in and you’re doing everything in your power but it’s still not enough? If the laws of the universe allowed it—I could build Rome in a day. I’ve got the drive, passion, grit, and energy. But only if “Rome” is my music career. I don’t care at all for much anything else. It’s one of the only things that lights me up. I want to live the pop star life so bad. I want to make money from what I love. I don’t want to clock in anymore. That’s all I want.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 21:48 !!! Mannn it’s like I keep waiting for somebody to tell me to give up, but I know that this is what I want so I keep showing up every day, but my brain is just like why are you still doing this? It’s not worth it just give up.😣
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: dude this video is mindblowing for me and im not even done watching the first half of it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I know, part of it is being engrossed in this quick money and how do I get the highest paying job mentality to think beyond more deeper into purpose of the individual
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It always looks like that for me. I am motivated, overwork myself. Getting sick is my body’s way of saying to stop
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it gets so exhausting reminding myself sometimes that to get to the part where a thing is done, i first have to stick to the doing. it's especially hard for things that are never truly finished. some chores or life goals feel like pushing the rock up the hill. i will be doing it eternally.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Even if you’re not religious, Paul goes hard here…   15 I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. 16 And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. 17 As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. 18 For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. 19 For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing. 20 Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.  Romans 7:15-20

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's my 2 year anniversary of being locked in, I think I got 3 more to go but honestly might just stay here. Word of advice to anyone that may be reading, don't try to give up distractions, just take control of what distracts yo u and allow yourself to be distracted occasionally. The grind feels badass, but if you never stop to allow yourself to be swept up by life, you'll reach the other of the two extremes and feel like you're not quite living. I'm not sure how to explain this, but it's so important, so I'll try; there's a certain ability which is very hard to gain conscious control over, it feels like uncoiling the spring on the minds clockwork, a very deliberate investment in allowing all your senses to feel. Honestly, it's also a type of focus; there comes a point where the focus on the grind becomes so distracting that all your channels of orientation within reality become dampened. When the quality of your reality suffers, you subconsciously lose some of your motivation to remain at your task within it. Enough focus to realize that you're human, with human limitations, and wind back the pendulum swing trying to view the opposite extreme as the easy fix. Changing one's mindset isn't enough, we have to be able to cultivate our reactions, perceptions, ideals; in order to find balance. Shifting just enough to not fall over. If you never focus to deliberately chill out, you'll never be able to really lock in.   Running at 50%, 85% of the time. Took a long time to get to that point. Even running at 40%, 60% of the time seems to be better than what most are doing; certainly better than running at 110%, 1% of the time (we all started there, it's miserable). You WILL need to be delusional if you're set on turning a want into a need; and that comes with its own downsides, the main one being that actual needs become neglected once you're willing to literally throw your life away in pursuit of a dream. Hold on the just enough realism to realize that dreams cannot be pursued by a dead man. In hindsight, it's crazy feeling like you're starving because you took some time to eat and stay healthy; but it's also one of the best feelings, because that's what purpose feels like. Don't let purpose kill you, don't let yourself die without it. Cheers.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: why would i watch this video when i could be locking in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ive been off of tik tok, insta, snap, twitter and facebook for 3 years. Me and my girl decided to do it together and we havent looked back since. been much happier and healthier since. 10/10 would reccomend.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was so happy when he put the ad right before the point he makes about life not having a skip button😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Man I’m cooked, had to lock in just to finish this video
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: From my experience and other's I've known. The addiction to "locking in" without doing it is a form of self-soothing, because many of my generation aren't taught that it's okay to be tired and feel overworked the environment we've been brought into. A lot of people like me and before me were taught that the simple sin of not enjoying hard work and having the gall to voice it is even worse. When I was little, I was told I wasn't "allowed to be tired" for some reason or another. To "lock in" is to temporarily escape into BEING that person you're forced to think is the only person you're allowed to be without being branded as a bad person.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i have to wake up at 4am and do 500 pushup or else i will fall into an eternal hole of sorrow.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 4:34   “We all have a certain amount of energy and time, and if you spread out that emergency evenly amongst 1,000 different seeds, the most depressing thing you can grow is 1,000 blades of grass. But if you’re actually able to put your energy onto one thing, sure, you might not have 1,000 blades of grass, but the one thing you will have is an oak tree.”  Notice how the image he used with this quote does show an oak tree, yes, but it also has a large grassy plain.  There is no shame in living a life analogous to growing 1,000 blades of grass. You don’t have to do something great with your life. There is still a certain beauty in being a part of the field of grass. The image is incomplete without it.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: comfort kills urgency and no urgency kills discipline
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: accepting that its just over is way easier than fake hopes
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I didn’t have goal before I started to locking in. The only reason I started to do something was I hated myself, and I needed to get out of the hole my mind was in. I found the goal while trying to getting out of the hole. Right now it is not certain if I am going to achieve that goal, but at least I am out of the dungeon. When ever I start to fall, become lazy fear of going back into whole makes me move. Still I am lazy, and goalless ,but at least the hate to myself made me do something, and actually locking in. So if you are goalless or lazy, just look at yourself and ask, “What will I have after 10 years if I stay like this?” Then I hope something will start to burn inside you. Farewell reader.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Me laying in my bad at 2 am motivation cycle being called out so hard
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The outside world is constantly distracting us that's why we get confused about what we want and look to others. Straight up all you got to do is like 90 minutes of looking at a wall bc that will reconnect you to your inner self and your desires aspirations etc. Write down anything that you think would be important. I guarantee you will have one goal come to mind doing this.   Most ppl don't do it bc it's boring and a lot of times painful bc you won't like what your inner voice is telling you. But that pain will lessen if you do it long enough plus it will motivate you to change.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Love how he gets up earlier every year, slowly becoming nocturnal. Peak locking in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I go to the gym because I imagine this scenario where my mother is about to fall from a high place and she's holding my hand with all that she got. And if I am not able to pull her up quickly, she'll be gone, so I need to be able to help her for her to survive. fr
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is the answer I came to realize inside myself after some years of questioning my whole existence summarized in a text
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: what i would add to this, is thing that we perceive to be our distractions, are often times our needs. if the distraction for you is going to scroll tiktok, it can be a good thing generally if it helps you decompress your brain, have a few laughs and log off. it is a literal human need to unwind, it is not a problem. it only becomes a problem when negative emotions are attached to it (because you have scrolled too long and now feel lazy and unfulfilled, unable to stop) then sure, it is a distraction indeed. so subconsciously losing that motivation may be you not meeting your own needs. to play, create, socialize or get distracted as you said. so trying to shame yourself for simply wanting to chill from constant work will slowly eat you alive.  no big conclusions here, just felt like you've touched up on something i was thinking before as well.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ye i get what you are saying. Hard work, but let life happen from time to time. Repent and read Romans 3:20-28

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What kind of business are you doing, or what are you considering your very own state of being locked in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ⁠ @cult_suicide It wasn’t a business or a big thing. It was an effort for a small goal which I achieved. Locking in was doing the work without any music, rain sounds etc. It was my brain, the work and myself. In the end it worked out.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @yen9338 😭 okay but if they're serious, that's not that corny of a scenario to want to improve on. It's definitely wayyy more than just that though like plz 💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was struggling with EXACTLY this for 2 years. When I talk to people online about it they just say "Oh but you gotta do that stuff you dont want to be a loser would you?" I just dont have enough reason to change. I havent had any bad experiences living the way I do. I might have in the future but the might have part doesnt stick in my brain. I stopped planning because everytime I make a plan I turn it into a complicated mess which I will never be able to do. I started accepting that maybe only surviving isnt that bad. Maybe I dont have to do something with my life. I am just a smart monkey, why do I have to complicate my life so much to get to somewhere in society. I am 100% sure that I can find a random job and live my life. Maybe sometimes I will be jealous of other people but hey I can manage that but I can't manage to keep up to my plans more than a week. Maybe in the future I will have a why or get a wake up call but for now in this state I have started to see the world as meaningless and in this meaningless world I dont really have to do anything other than surviving (Well I dont even have to do that but dying is actually harder than living). I am only 13 minutes in the video and you exactly described me. I wonder what are your suggestions. Thanks so much for making this video.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Locking in saved me multiple times in school lol...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is the year I've actually locked in. Lost nearly 60 pounds, picked up 3 new side hustles and its just the start on the verge of that next big step
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm finna lock in starting today. Shiiiiiiiiiiii wish me luck.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: between rawdogging and locking in, we're just reinventing meditation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Haven’t watched the video yet, but I think the whole “locking in” thing is a cry for help. Phones have absolutely demolished this generation’s attention span.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i locked in recently, been going to the gym, eating well, and taking care of my mental health. i haven't felt this at peace in a while
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 12:21 in this video and this describes my life perfectly, im in this state of loop and i can’t leave, im wasting my life and i can’t do anything to stop this cycle, i hope one day to have the chance to edit this comment and update this situation as a bad time in my life, if you have a suggest or advice is really appreciated, if you readed this do it, the regret will haunt you forever
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You know, I found out that the ‘lock in’ thing doesn’t work when we just say it in our minds.  It happens, at least for me, when I empty my mind, and do the strenuous task immediately. The more I hesitate, there’ll be that voice in my mind telling me to just put it off for tomorrow.  Nowadays, I feel more inclined to work when I am unmotivated and lazy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this literally has been me bro… this whole decade i’ve been bullshitting, year after year after year. the pandemic has fucked me over mentally and i have struggled to recover since. it really took me looking back at how much time passed since i then and dude… 5 full long and hard years of lying to those to love me, lying to myself and just becoming such a horrible person. i’ve struggled to get out of this repeated cycle of bettering my life. im ready to genuinely give this shit a go now, actually give this game of life my absolute best. i hope everyone else who’s either on their journey, or is looking to start… that you all prosper and finally take the initiative to make lemonade out of the lemons. let’s be fucking great guys. this is our time to stop dimming our own light and let it shine brighter than the sun. to prove all of those who either doubted or lost faith in us, wrong bro… we’re in this together. women to man🤝
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yk im cooked when i had to check the comments after hearing month 67
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also give yourself some gratification and grace. Perfectionism will kill your sense of direction and get you nowhere. You don’t need to put in your all everyday because you’re not a robot, you’re human.   Imagine your thoughts as your personal coach. You wouldn’t want your coach to teach you everything within a day or a week, or to loathe on your actions and your mistakes. You’d want them to be patient as you go, to learn things at a comfortable pace, to congratulate and push you to commit.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Take a shot every time he says "Lock in"  Totally hammered rn #lockingin
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I would of sworn I've heard sport coaches say that in the 70s - 2000s 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i think he was like this year I am gonna lock in and post on YouTube every day lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “The power comes from a need, not a desire.”  If you make the one thing you want the most a need, then you’ll lock in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 19:50 bro this is my biggest issue man... like i only work best for people can't keep up with my own words to myself
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this year i did lock in, got a job, made presidents list in college, been losing weight, getting good at davinci, and banished depression from my mind
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My advice is to set goals but take baby steps. Don't be overly ambitious and set unrealistic goals.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i think the same but sometimes i guess you gotta push yourself a little. ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i feel you man, i can never commit to anything long-term. i just cant seem to find any motivation to better myself.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: John assaraf created that years ago phrase, give credit next time. Need is not needed, just a lifestyle that gives emotional fulfillment.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This this this!!!!  I need to survive.  I never took my health seriously until I saw my labs at .5 away from diabetes.  I was the person who said I’d never ever give up any food and I immediately gave up sugar.  It sucked for about a eeek but all I could think was I want to watch my kids grow up. I am too Audhd to have to take insulin or time my eating.  There are so many reasons I need to reverse this.  And so I did.  I had to cut people out of my life. I cried at the grocery store and driving past McDonalds.  But now I’m down 60lbs and haven’t eaten McDonalds in like 2 months and I about a eeek ago a snake of a person randomly brought over McDonald’s fries and handed them to me and I did not eat a single one!!!!!  I  so locked in to not dying from diabetes.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Recently, I bought an old BMX bike from 2008 for  10$ and around a month I've been hardly locked in in repairing it and riding it so I'm pretty happy and I hope it will keep me going for as long as the bike work :D
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "We will spend more time looking for that shortcut than just doing the thing we know we want to do" made me pause
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the analogies used in this video have a lot of relatable substance. lowkey fire video.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have to concede that everything you said is true. Despite we have the internet helping us locking in our goal, self-doubt always appear in the journey if you constantly compare your progress to other, it feel like you're lost or what you're dedicating will lead to nowhere else. Yet you need to do it anyway as that doubting will fade away as soon as we achieve something, not big but enough for us to admire our effort and we will start grinding seriously. I hope you guys can get what you want in the future even if its hard or frustrated.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is kind of sad but when I was a teenager my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was a very hard time for me and my family, but it was also a wake up call in a weird way. That life ends or changes very drastically sometimes. I was dealing with so much sadness, anger and frustration because of her diagnos and I didn't know how to deal with it. I mean, I was only 13. And because of these feelings I accidentally locked in. I had a why or a strong force pulling me to do something and achieve something that I believe wouldn't have been possible without this happening. I locked in to become one of the top students in my high school, meaning I could apply to any education and to any other school in my city. And I mean I LOCKED IN, I spent sooo much time studying instead of dealing with my emotions (they later came to bite my ass, don't worry, which I've actually dealt with :)). Before this I had decent grades, didn't stand out much in class or any where else really. But now I was the best student in my class and one of the best in my school. I was one of the smart kids, and because of it I became even smarter. It sounds cocky, I know, but what I mean is when you lock in to really study or whatever you acheive so much more than good grades. The knowledge... I sound kinda crazy right know but hopefully you understand what I mean and what accidentally locking in also can lead to. I believe it's human to find strength in pain, and although I'm not grateful for the pain, I'm grateful for the motivation. Does that make sense? What I'm trying to say is because I had a strong and well painful WHY I could turn that into something quite impressive. Today, my mom is well, 8 years cancer free and we are both stronger and smarter than we've ever been <3
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I made a to do list in 2023 its basically 100 days workout routine.. I didn't do it for years despite getting reminded everyday. Idk why but today finally I decided to do that. Finally after years!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ascended to a state of perma locked in.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: thank you bringing the reality of how to lock in. everybody gets hyped for that beginning stage but not enough critical attention is paid towards its exact formula
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 20:50 how long did it take you to make this video? because its clearly very well thought out & edited. props to you man
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got my shit together at the start of 2025. My boyfriend wanted me to try lifting weights. I thought id hate it because most of the exercise id done before was cardio. But i went. And i realized i only hated cardio. I practically got addicted to the gym. The gym for me is mental relaxation, and yeah, some days im tired or not motivated and some days i just dont go. And thats okay too, its not all or nothing which is still hard to remember, but its important to let yourself rest and listen to your body, some days your body says you shouldnt go.  With that being said, im healthier, im stronger, about 4-5 times stronger actually, i had no upper body strength at the start. Im not falling victim to skinny culture, which deminishes women, makes them weak, unhealthy, unable, voiceless. Currently i am the best physical version of myself. Its also safe to say that there is no end goal. I will never reach a point where im satisfied and done, ill always keep striving for more. Thats the thing about fitness, there is no end goal, you can always keep improving. If you do start, youll notice that once you reach a goal you had set, you wont be satisfied and youll set a new goal and try to reach that one. Its a never ending cycle.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am genuinely greatful for this advice, as a kid, i will spend days doing nothing during the summer, and during those days i feel like fuking shit, and when i try to better myself i cant do it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Paying attention is so difficult they had to give it a cool name.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As someone currently training combat sports, I can tell you how annoying it is to have a group of friends ask for advice to "lock in" at the gym, only to quit after a month or so because they lose their motivation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 8:41 "just try it" meanwhile thats how my life looked life for the past few months lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As a guy on self improvement, I can assure you that this guy is my wall. I was fucking serious about growth back then in 2022, I got my shit together but after two weeks it went back to normal. I swore 2023 to be my year, journalled, exercise, talking with girls, watching Hamza and Tate, meditation, plan, sports etc. But nothing changed, I was still a vague motivation guy. 2024 came by, then I went to Adonis gang but the motivation again was brief. This time however things began spiraling downwards. 2025 I swore this year to finally become my best. 6 months have passed by (almost) and I'm still where I was in 2022.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's funny, I started referring to my current goal as a "need" and thinking I was weird for that, as everyone was saying I don't "need" to do it. But it genuinely became such a deep-rooted need like eating or sleeping, the drive is kind of insane.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im legit working 2 jobs and i just turned 20 after graduating college and hitting my first 1K subscribers while going gym and making music and tiktoks to build a brand and image. Im a hustler fr 🔥

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Because the stars werent in aligned for it. Listen to the book turning pro, you will know why you didn't. Your lifestyle had to been in alignment with it and the states.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: coming from a person who has been serious about this journey since July of last year. if I'm being honest this whole tiktok "tiktok motivation locking in" shit is fucking corny to me it always has. some people use their platform to help people in this journey while others just spew and project their stupid and unrealistic ideologies. which shit that don't even matter profiting off of people's insecurity. if you want real change. step out of your comfort zone take a big look in the mirror and ask do I want to live like this. also its very important to find your Purpose \ YOUR WHY.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @suikagaming357 yes, instead of those toxic podcast guys.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this comment thread has made me feel like i have different copies of myself around the world, all trying to solve the game of life and find themselves. i wanted to ask to get a better perspective, how old are you guys? im 17 and have been on a self improvement journey since 14
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @isaacmortuus  holy shit, i am 17 too, I will be 18 this year, I have started watching self improvement videos at 14 too, but i slacked in taking action.. so I am still stuck
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @isaacmortuus  turned 18 this April, started self improvement around 16
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: stop listening to men on podcasts talking about how to get women lmfao. most women do not want what those men say that women want, and a lot of those men who do those podcasts are misogynists. just be genuinely kind and caring. if you’re in a relationship with a woman ask her what she wants, don’t listen to random guys on the internet who think they know what she wants
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bro… are we the same person? In 2023 around spring I realized I was unhappy with my life so I said I was gonna “lock in” that summer, but in reality all I did was go to the gym once a week then binge watch TV. I heavily relied off motivation so I never got anywhere, then 2024 I said it was gonna be “my year”… once again nothing changed because I kept going back to the bad habits and wasn’t consistent with the good ones. Now, like you said, half of 2025 is over and I screwed around a lot and wasn’t consistent so I’m still kinda where I am 2 years later…  But, I feel a lot more wise than I was 2 years ago, not solely lying on motivation to do the things I needa get done. Sure I still struggle w things like procrastination but I’ve been consistent for about a week so that’s a new milestone for me. I think at this point im so unhappy with my life that I’d rather perish than stay the same for another year which is why I’m finally getting my act together, hope u can too bro..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bro.. i was bout to do the same.. i watch Hamza a lot.. wdym how isn't ur life different?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @HemlataUgale  because it was all a lie... Congratulations you figure it out.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Brother😂choose one thing, and get incredibly good at that one thing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Now that we've realised THE MATRIX OF THE GRIND...its time for an escape plan(Solution)..Threads Open
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im like in the same pathway like you tbh. in winter 2023 for some reason my brain clicked and realized i can control my own decisions and start taking control of my life so i started watching self improvement, fueling my brain with knowledge like good habits mentality etc. then 2024 came by and i started to get frustrated bc i didn't achieved anything that i promised so i just got depressed. then i tried to "heal" for the next months (never really tried but at least i put attention to my toughts and i learned how to not be so harsh with my self) then until 2025 came by and i started taking action slowly and still failing bc of the points the guy said in the video. i put my attention towards stupid things, i keep falling myself to my old habits, didn't really have a good why change myself and just trying to feel good thinking i'm doing smth with my life when im not doin shit. this pasts weeks tho i really REALLY tried to do something with my life and i finally started doing small things like reading the bible (im christian) or meditating. i think the reason i never really tried is bc i didn't put the attention that my goals needed and i even had a good why in the first place. but know i know, i just need to start doing (oh wow)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this is literally me bro. exact timeline
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You have to pick a project, something you really care about not just something that makes money or fits into some vague image of what a sucessful guy is supposed to look like. Read a really long book you always wanted to read, pick a place you REALLY want go to (maybe you've dreamt about it since you were a kid) and make it a goal, or building something whether that is renovating an old decrepit house, writing a book, building a table from scratch, learning to make a pizza from scratch, I dunno it's up to you. Don't learn to code if you don't really want to code unless your main goal is making money to use towards some larger goal (buy a farm?). Life is all about momentum. Gotta build positive momentum anyway you can and build from there, too many people try to go 0-100 in the first week and burnout.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: same but i destroy the chained like there is downward spiral there is an upward spiral too give the goal a feeling a meaning a promise a need to make it a life that you can't accept not having that thing ignite that fire in you,you will feel angry for not being there yet everyday, i finally got in control i binged every goggins/tate speech on  earth and when you have a fixed goal in mind it fires you up design your dream life know what you want the body the car the house ..... manifest it when i close my eye i see my future body and my dream car as if they where real waiting for me you will figure it out i believe in you it will take time tho 🫡🫡
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: if you watch tate youve alr failed locking in 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: hey, I just wanted to tell you that Jesus loves you so much more than you can ever imagine
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nobody can sustain that. Relax, life will happen to you even if you don't hustle. Find a balance, life resides in the gray area.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not being sarcastic saying this; good for you bro. Reminds me of myself at your age. I wish you success dude. If you ever feel burnt out balancing everything remember progress isn’t a straight line and you’re the only one running your race in life. When I was 20 I was working two jobs in media and finishing up my bachelors degrees while training for distance running. My best advice to you is to start saving however you can even if it’s a little at a time and just build up. That’s helped me a ton through rainy days and investing into my business.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @useyourimaginasean  thanks for the advice bro. I'll be sure to do that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I fell asleep mid video and had a such an amazing 1 hour nap,now i feel like i turned back time by several years
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i resonated a lot with the part about expecting every day to be 100% better than the previous. i work out on the daily. i used to be a skinnyfat 190 5'9, now i'm a lean 160. i love the way i look, or, at least that's what i tell myself. every time i look in the mirror its an awful feeling of disgust. i am flawed and i will never forgive myself until i am perfect. that is why i continue to work out and train to be the best i can possibly be. i know perfection is impossible, which guarantees that i will be working out, forever unsatisfied. but i will not quit, because that will guarantee  failure. if you want to begin working out, because you want to love yourself. go for it. there will be times when your muscles are pumped and you're post gym session, you'll love yourself. but an hour later you will have nothing but searing hatred for the way you look. understand and consider what it takes.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The intro is pure comedy gold. Best hook to a video ever.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: bro peoople who disliked are in denial about the situation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was locked in for almost 8 month but now I realize I don't have a good reason so I think I'll just go back scrolling
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I enjoyed the video but as someone who loves to listen to YouTube videos as my background while I do stuffs, it would be great if you could increase the volume of the video too (i had my volume on max and it was still a bit hard to hear)  Just a suggestion and keep up the good work!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I couldn‘t even lock in to fully watch this video
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video basically ends at 1:14
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I really liked this video and I feel like it really helped! I’ve felt so many of the things in it as well — like promising again and again to go to the gym, to get up and do x, y, z, making lists for things I need to do and then not sticking to the lists. I have ADHD, autism, and OCD as well so a lot of the time I take my feelings/ how I feel into account when thinking about things. They are the priority, esp if they are anxious/ fearful. I’ve been reading a book on OCD and kind of agreed at one point about what it was talking about — avoiding going to the grocery store on a specific day bc they were scared — only to turn to the next page and realise that this was wrong. Procrastination and avoidance has protected me, or I guess, so I thought. Kept me alive but didn’t help me grow/ thrive. It’s the same with perfectionism and overcompensation as well — for written assignments I’d read and go over so many papers instead of actually writing, promising myself that bc I’d read so many papers I’d create a great paragraph and reference so many things, only to get overwhelmed, burned out, and stuck on the writing process due to perfectionism. I have Ritalin now and it’s helped a lot with doing things, but I think I just need to practice leaning into discomfort, into challenge, and that being a part of the process. I also was sick of being unhappy/ tired and so wrote a list of things to do consistently that I think will make me happier/ mentally less anxious in the long run. One includes meditating every day, but then I skipped yesterday and changed it to two days, and then changed it to five minutes. Baby steps, right? I did the same with the gym — go to the gym, just for 20 mins. It doesn’t have to be even intense exercise, and you just have to go for 20 mins, and then you can leave. I’m also trying to keep my room cleaner, and again set myself for 20 mins of cleaning every second day. But I can’t do 20 mins today, at least not all in one go, at least not right now. But I could do 5 mins, even if I hate it or feel lost or it’s pointless or idk what to do. Anyways, this video was very helpful :) Thank you :) I liked as well how you touched on a lot of the performative aspects of productivity or locking in, or even the social aspect where you tell people about all the studying or whatever you’ve done. And it seems inspirational but in the moment it’s normally hard and sometimes boring. But it does the thing/ gets results! And it becomes easier and less uncomfortable!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: bro, you've inspired me to lock in more than I ever have my entire teenage years. Your first video "This is About Brain Rot" helped me realize how much wasted time I was spending on useless distractions and not getting anything done, and that video inspired me to take action and start going to the gym. This summer, I've been doing that and really focusing on computer science and reading books, and I think you're absolutely right when long-term goals and success are a long game, not a short one. U really inspired me to take accountability and look at myself as a better person, keep up the uploads bro!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: that intro is both relatable but hilarious
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I can’t even lock in and watch this full video😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 12:45 Comfortably numb by Pink Floyd mentioned
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Stop reading this comment and lock in back on the video. Your attention span is ruined, I swear !
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “…When it’s actually an ultra marathon, that never truly ends.”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Proud to say I’m 19 and half locked in. Saving about 75% of my income for a house to get into real estate and I’m almost to my 10k goal. My why is to take care of my family  Edit: My lowest point was 2023 and I was on my own at 16 for two years completely broke and “addicted” to weed smoking all day everyday. I’m now sober 100% working towards my ged. If I can do it you have no excuse
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Need to lock in on this video. Just put it in the background while doing work
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Perfect description of why I don’t think I’ll ever stop working out
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Today, I am making the steps to change. I was going to say something negative, but then I asked "for what?". I had a moment of weakness. Have a good rest of August.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @DragoonCenten  you too. make the steps to change and never go back.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: sir i think either ur deaf or ur phone is broken
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @sostl154 are you an ear doctor or a phone repair person?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: technically you could summarize almost anything in 2 sentences but it leaves out 99% of the nuances
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well he says "locking in works, but only if you do it" that's all the rest is filler
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's because you have a short attention span and had no interest in locking in.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Clippy just wanted to help you lock in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not if it's your 3rd time watching.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank u, congratulations on achieving ur goal🎉
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just kinda... sat here. And watched all this. No game, no Discord, nothing. Just sat here and listened. And you know what? I'm proud of my progress. I can brush my teeth every day, even if I don't feel like it. I can go for a walk around the lake every single day of the year. There was a time I could barely get anything done. Frankly the only issue in my life right now is that a huge part of my enjoyment comes from staying up late, which my school schedule doesn't vibe with. But by god I'm gonna set that aside too, just to show up on time like always, and put in the effort to become an IT supporter. Greatly helped by talking with friends in class, naturally.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I truly love this kind of videos, especially this video, when you zoning out but still understand every word, every thought the author is saying, without any distraction, having the full vision of what he saying. This video made me do a lot of rethinking about my everyday decisions, and my behavior. I think this video really changed my view of every need and want, and my mindset. Thank you for that. This has to be the best vid I've watched this year
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: no way we are talking about how we shouldnt focus on our goals, this videos make me believe even more that im doin the right thing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 25:15 dude you stopped my auto breathing :(, genuinely though this video is amazing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I, respectfully, disagree. Maybe I'm built different (and by different I mean "stupid"), but I used to workout because I hated myself. When I stopped hating myself I found myself still going to the gym. Why? I don't know. Habit, I guess? And there it is, your motivation, our "why" must be just strong enough for you to do the thing you want to do for like, a month. Maybe two. Then gym becomes brushing teeth. It just happens. So ok, I still had a strong "why", but then COVID happened. My habit was gone, I gained weight and going back to gym was demotivating. So what did I do? I made my goals really small. "Go to the gym", that's all I wanted myself to do. If you want to quit 5min after you arrived, do it. If you want to check in, go to the changing room, look around and just leave - do it. But your goal should be small enough, you'd feel ashamed if you failed. And then you build on it. Ok, I went to the gym, sometimes I went home early, but now we're 3 months in, going to the gym takes no mental effort whatsoever. Let's start expanding that goal. Few people who start with the goal of "I want abs" get abs. But people who start small might just get them one day. I have no real why. I guess my "why" is because I am in control. There is that section of my brain that is responsible for being me. And there are other sections of my brain that are responsible for other stuff. And I won't my brain stand in my way. I 100% agree with 28:15 tho. If you go on a diet, go ahead! look for low calorie, but filling  food. But expect that there will be hunger and cravings. If you are like "I ate stuff because I was hungry", well what did you expect? anticipate difficulty and have a plan.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: actually such a goated video man. im 18 minutes in, taking notes, and actually thinking about my life. So many things said here are so simple yet so true. our definition of locking in has been wrong all our lives
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the number of clips in this video, woof🙌
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 2:45 the word i think you were looking for was “apathy”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have that 2am motivation all the time 🤣 trying to sleep and remembering random details of this video game I’ve been trying to find for years keeps remotivating me to look for it and I want to try recreating it XD
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: its either being uncomfortable in unfufillment, procrastination or being uncomfortable doing something new and working towards something you want. amazing, going to try to remember whenever my dumbass brain has a tight procrastination grip on me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also, it is worth remembering to love yourself and give yourself time to rest during that journey. Don’t beat yourself up for not achieving the expectations you set for yourself — just embrace the journey and be supportive of yourself. And remember to stop from time to time and reflect on how far you’ve come, and celebrate your progress. Love the video! Good stuff!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m 8 months into a project, I needed this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The thing is, for me, 2020 was ACTUALLY going to be my year. That year i had amazing plans, the year got to an amazing start, by february i was fully gassed up and everything started to work out. Plans started unfolding, i had future plans too. But then covid happened… and it knocked me off my feet so badly that i just never regained my footing. That is my experience. Ever since then, the world has been so instable i don’t think those plans can ever happen again.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I listened to this on the stair master
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: All of these big corporations have tailored their products to keep you engaged and mindless, the biggest "locking in" tactic I've taken is genuinely just dropping social media, but that boredom of not having stimulation hits different. For the past few months I've been great about keeping screen time down across the board but I was curious what tiktok looked like after not having it for nearly a year and to my surprise, it was actually just really sad. Most of the fyp feed was just people calling out others about chopped men or some other stupid thing I haven't cared to keep up with.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got injured pretty badly last year, twisted my knee and tore most of the ligaments in the process. Forced me to lock in to recover properly though. Now I am nearly back to 100% and mentally far stronger. I wouldn't necessarily recommend that method, but it triggered that part of me that needs instead of wants.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this  aot quote  hits hard  "if u cant abandon everything u cant change anything".
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sometimes telling people your going to do something can help you to do it because some people feel guilty if you don't especially after telling someone. I do it sometimes when I don't want to do a certain chore around the house.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Have a good day tommorow and the next day
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Where are you hearing someone say not to lock in?? This is a video about how some people fail to consistently stay focused enough to get to their goal..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Ladyuko  bc they're not locked in. cmon bro lock in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nah the point is then you're just somebody who's busy focusing on goals. You're still stuck in the pattern of suffering if you think you're somebody at all.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We shouldn’t focus on our goals?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's not about focusing on your goals, its about constantly being like "im locking in" as if its a drug, you'd prefer to say and get the feeling of being locked in then actually getting whats in the end
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: keep doing what you are doing brother, I am absolutely with you! This guy is just yapping
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @javisteinI don’t think this guy is just yapping
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: To me it sounds like you allowed your “why” to escape yourself. You went started strong but didn’t make it as an actual vital part of your life, if you can picture your life without that part of your routine, then that’s completely on you. I was very overweight too, and now I’m jacked, I’m going 6-7 years strong to the gym and I cannot for the life of me picture myself NOT going to the gym, I would fall back into the hole I climbed myself out of. My “why” stands strong even until now, it’s mandatory, no exceptions. My “why” is “Because I will not allow myself to fall to the depths of hell I once let myself stay in, I want to live”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Martianpwner525  I can picture my life without a hand, and I do not believe that makes me any more likely to lose a hand. Life has a way of humbling people. Positive motivation can be strong, but it requires a habit building skill. Also, doesn't ruin your mental, so that's a plus
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Rather than our "why" being big or grand it's more like a reason that is justifiable for you to go through discomfort / do something. At least that's how I imagine it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes I've found this the only way to get myself to do goals. Anything big off the bat just killed my self-confidence. And watching content like this only made me freeze up of "what I'm making of my life". I'll just use my current life as an example that's easily relatable. I have a big test coming up and it's due in 3 days, but I haven't finished the reading to complete the task. So I intellectualize it (math out how long the reading will take, think about how prepared I have to be etc) until I'm frozen and procrastinate until the last day. I don't want that. But pushing myself out of fear never worked very well for me and lead to burnout. So what do I do? I sit down and tell myself the only thing I have to do. First, I open the textbook.   Just this showing up dissipates all the upfront fears I had and Intellectualizing I did to get them. After that, the next goal is just to... read it. Yeah I know. Crazy. But it gets me out of my head.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: apathy is not caring; this feeling would be closer to dissociation/detachment, caused by stress or sadness. if it were apathy then you wouldn't care if you're progressing or not.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @awphyline.1133  holy shit wasnt expecting to actually get an answer
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: just thinking like that already sets you up for failure ! If it was gonna work the first it’ll work the the second time
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: you gonna spend the next 5 years with this mindset too?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: if its any consolidation this happened to so many people, youre not alone, it will get better, ignore every single other reply here, youre gonna be alright
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: All of these replies had to be in middle school / elementary when covid happened, lol. No conceptualization of how severely it hindered the world’s progress.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey, it's 2020 again. Put that perspective back on. Tomorrow is no different than today, or Februrary of 2020. Start now.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Took me 4 long years to get my personal and professional life on track
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Covid was 5 year ago wtf are you talking about
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So are you going to give up because of on obstacle that made it get harder, or do you actually want it? Because if 5 years have gone by and you still haven't done it, it sounds like you didn't actually want it and you're just pretending like you did. If you actually want it, don't make excuses,  do what it takes to get it, no matter what. Don't post about it online until you've already got it. Nobody cares what you're going to do, they care about what you've done.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah, cancer really knocked me off my feet as a teenager.. could move from instability or faith after that. Fuck excuses, lock in homie
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I hear you bro, but don’t let those obstacles stop you. These obstacles in life are meant for you to either be pushed down by, or climb and rise
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @FearlessUntamed  not excuses, reality
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes they can bro. Get rid of that mindset a new future EVERYDAY and most importantly: ask God for guidance
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I created big plans for 2020 and then covid happened. It took me 2 years to create new plans in the beginning of 2022. Then the war happened and plans were crushed. So after my plans being completely destroyed by “living in historic moment” twice in a row, I can definitely tell you that it is worth it to create plans and adjust them to reality, because it will take you forever to wait until the perfect time for plans come. You have 2 options: create plans, trying to do what you want and get at least something or abandon plans and wishes in highly unstable world to get nothing you once wanted
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We are men we have to make it happen
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That’s why you aren’t made for success🤷‍♂️ giving up was never an option for successful people
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I cannot understand how COVID has affected people so much
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s been five years bro, we all were affected by Covid. Don’t make excuses, acknowledge it happened, and move on. We can’t spend our entire lives lingering on what could be, we just need to do what is possible in the moment.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: hey, I just wanted to tell you that Jesus loves you so much more than you can ever imagine
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @Jesus_LovesYou13  waiting for the rapture I guess
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Be happy with where you’re at, you won’t change over night. Make reasonable logical decisions that make you happy, motivated and hopeful, you don’t have to do everything at once, you don’t need a mike tyson schedule, just live your teenage life, don’t think of everything as this big hard goal that you need to get super disciplined to achieve, just work, and you’ll get there, just try to do anything. As long as you’re happy and see a bright future you’re on the right path. Your mind can always change, be aware of the difference between the ”2 am motivation” aka the one that doesn’t stay, vs the one that actually accelerates you and keeps you at that speed, what you REALLY want vs what you think you need. Happiness is success, and you’ll only achieve happiness doing something you’re okay with. If your brain keeps going back I don’t see it as a sign that you truly want to continue. Take it slow. You’ll be fine. Good luck out there :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: for me it has gotten so far, that even the act of quitting and promising myself to change has formed into a habit. I’m telling it to myself everyday knowing that I’m not going to last
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is honestly such an amazing video. I've been going to the gym now for about 5 years, and I have also been playing piano since I was 8. I think probably the most important takeaway from this video was that consistency > short bursts of commitment. I have learned how important this philosophy is over the years and that a bad day at the gym or a bad session on the piano is better than not sitting down or working out at all. There were SO MANY TIMES when I absolutely HATED piano! But I pushed through those feelings, and as long as s played at least once a day (even if it was for 5 minutes) I was satisfied. I have made very steady, consistent progress, and now, when I look at myself and how I used to play 3 years ago, I'm a completely different pianist, and I've improved drastically. When you start something, it's really hard to stick to it, but something that helps me achieve my goals is to not have unrealistic expectations on my ability to do that thing, and just do a little bit every day. There is no use beating yourself up over missing a day or not counting your calories perfectly. As long as you show up, or attempt it, that's plenty more than most people can do.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For me the time in the gym is like a training montage cause In any exercise I could do while watching a video I did, while resting I either read novel or watch video so it felt like ine
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: La hawla wa la quwata illa billah. There is no power or strength except with ALLAH.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: best part about this is most parts are uncut and said rooted from your thoughts
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Locked in last year. Quit TikTok and started waking up at 5am. Started journaling and touching grass.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'll never forget that feeling of jus being able to run without thinking at my first marathon and only focus on the run. No music no nothing... Just running
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you're reading this right now, I just want to say; I'm rooting for you. We’re strangers, but that doesn’t mean I don’t care. I know what it’s like to feel like you're pushing a boulder uphill. I felt that way until I picked up Manifest and Receive by Eva Hartley. I can’t explain it perfectly, but it changed my whole perspective. Since then, things have been flowing—money, peace, confidence. Maybe this is your moment too. Stay open. Wishing you more than you ever imagined. 💫💰
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just got promoted guess I’m locked in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i disagree that our brains only care about surviving long enough to reproduce. i think that’s a blanket statement because not everyone’s goal in life is to make a family in the traditional sense. but yes, you need goals and strong enough reasons in order to achieve them, and most importantly: you need to be doing it for yourself, not others. it takes self-awareness, self-reflection and self-compassion to go from that daily numbness, chasing temporary pleasures, to working towards something genuinely fulfilling. to actually feel determined. from my experience, learning more about the psychology of why these things happen has helped me gain a better understanding of the things i’m struggling with and the steps i can begin to take to feel more in control of my life, especially as someone with a complex childhood who experiences a lot of anxiety and depression. not mentioning that to gain pity or victimise myself, these are just facts that have contributed to why i personally feel the way i do about my life in the present moment. i’m not in a privileged position to access mental health support unfortunately, so i have to rely on online resources for support and guidance. the truth is progress isn’t linear. and yes, you need to be realistic with your expectations, which means not being too strict OR too lenient. finding that balance is hard. it means trial and error, which invites the possibility to be discouraged. it means failing a lot and learning to pick yourself back up again. having a supportive community or supportive people in your life helps exponentially, as like you said, humans are social creatures and having that sense of community is important to counteract loneliness amidst this hyperfixation to “lock in”.   Overall, i believe it’s a control problem. or even lacking the tools to build good self-control, which is required to be persistent and consistent with making progress towards your goals. Great video :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 13:00 dude i’ll be at work and some people literally can’t go 20 minutes without scrolling then they say they’re “locked in” cus they got the dopamine hit they wanted
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I wanted to start doing calisthenics and when I did, I promised I would learn 30 skills in like two months. I did not do that.   I then started again recently but instead I tried something else. Day one would be 1 push up, day 2 would be 2 push ups and so on. I can say with this approach I have been consistent, and honestly with this lesson I've added it to other aspects of my life. Every morning I meditate for only 5 minutes and I journal for only 5 minutes and I read for only 5 minutes. Thats about 15 minutes of doing shit. Honestly, its been working wonders.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 2:34 it's been half a decade since 2020 and it still blows my mind
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 1 minute in, I feel really called out but honestly, leave a like if you actually DID some of these things.  I ironically also started my “locked-in” journey in 2020 cuz that’s when I graduated and I actually DID eventually bring myself to delete all my social medias by 2022. I took risks, tried businesses, never really got anyware but I learned a bigger lesson on what really brings meaning and happiness, started cutting back and embracing a more minimalistic lifestyle starting around 2023 and really got serious about it by the very end of 2024.  I’m proud of you all that were able to do some of these things. But if you haven’t. It’s never too late guys. I don’t care if your 18 or 50
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: coming from someone who’s locked it and stayed with it, it’s worth it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 2:21 ok no im ending it here.... trying over and failing and retrying is the basic workload of changing ones self. physcology has already explained this.... you people are jjat obsessed with feeling good and being on your phone.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: gonna lock in on finding a way to watch this video without an internet connection
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Paying attention is so difficult they had to give it a cool name.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Aren't we made in his image? Doesn't that still mean the power is always within ourselves!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nice, bro. Don't give up. Also, don't forget to also work on the important tasks that advance your living conditions. School, work e.t.c.  Productive procrastination is also a thing 😂.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I never had money growing up—just constant stress about bills, arguments, and being told "we cant afford it." Honestly, I thought something was wrong with me, until I stumbled across Nixorus books. The moment I started reading, I felt this anger rise—realizing Id spent my entire life kept clueless about money on purpose. It literally felt like discovering a secret I wasnt meant to know. Im still shocked no ones banned this yet.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So basically “do or do not, there is no try”. Nice to know Yoda was giving solid advice
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Told myself to "lock in" to go to the gym and its been going good for the last 8 months, only times i missed were times i was sick or extremely tired, nobody told me to go, did it myself and its going good
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As an old Gen Z, there's a time where what I've done alone actually paid off when someone notice the improvemens, I didn't even know how satisfying it was until it happened.   The problem with young gen Z is that they lived in their young era of everything is in their hands. not all but almost everything is in their hands. they don't have to do anything for it because their parents is giving it. which is the problem.  Now, their in that stage of life to focus, which they don't have anymore, they gave that attention energy into everything, they have to be updated, they have to know the trend, they have to be in that level. it's all short term. "I want it, I get it" it's sad.   They're also in the stage of laziness, boredom and don't want to do the task. because... "why" they can't see the reason after learning all the stuff online. but deep down, they still want to "lock in"   They will only find the reason to do this once they've hit that climax in their life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: if i dont lock in this summer i quit life for good.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Where's my gang of people who go over past helpful videos at?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This are things that I know, but just have to be reminded about. I love the edit and switches. Thank you. Great work.❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: bro let the beat ride at the end
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I like how he left a few seonds at the end of the video, so it gives thr viewr time to process
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: my brains so dead this is such a good video but it’s so hard to finish it bcs of my attention span💀 I’m halfway in I’m gonna finish it and my “why” is cos I hate how I am and the way I live addicted to my phone gets me nowhere but to self destruction
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: thanks for the video bro, i seriously need to lock-in and in six months can someone remind me of this video. i want to come back and say thanks 🙏
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I like how you say expecially instead of especially.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I liked the video, but I wish it had tackled decision paralysis. It plays a huge role in why “locking in” rarely works out. Sure, it’s great that we have the internet and can access basically any information we want but it’s also the very thing that fuels our addiction to finding the most “optimized” way of doing things. It creates this paradox where the more tools we have, the harder it becomes to commit, because they generate the feeling that every choice might be wrong or inefficient. That’s why there are so many extreme routines floating around online. People often don’t realize that “optimized” should mean optimized for them, not just copying some influencer’s routine. The mindset of “they have what I strive for, so it must work for me” is incredibly common and it’s another reason why locking in fails. In theory, decision paralysis is a relatively harmless defense mechanism. It is an attempt to avoid failure or making the “wrong” choice. But if you’re trying to reach a goal and genuinely don’t know what to do (which is why I find the statement “you know what to do” a bit troubling), you’ll naturally start researching. And that leads to a massive pile of contradictory information, no matter the topic. AI doesn’t help much here either. It tends to give “one size fits all” answers, and even if you don’t like the response, it’ll just adapt it to your preferences without necessarily checking if it’s actually good. Its priority is your satisfaction, not your success (plus it can make things up out of nowhere yada yada). So people get stuck in this endless loop of analysis paralysis, constantly searching for the “best” solution and refusing to try anything until they’ve found the perfect routine. It’s not always about short-term pleasure. It can also be about the obsession with finally making it work this time, as we grow more desperate with each attempt.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the thing that finally got me to lock in was essentially falling into a full time job just by dumb luck thanks to a family friend. I realize this is hardly advice but I've noticed that its a lot more effortless to lock in when it isn't optional. I mean, in my head its not even a possibility that I can just stop going to work, or call out sick because I want to sleep more. I just, get up and do it. Because I know I have to. (this doesn't apply to you at all if you're suffering from depression btw. Its a very real disease and should be treated with the same level of seriousness as a broken bone)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Efforts compound if done consistently. Thing that sucks about compounding is that it takes a while for the gains to become massive and actually noticeable. But I just try to tell myself that there more I compound my efforts, eventually I will see the benefits
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this genuinely got me to go do my class work on a friday night :body-green-covering-eyes:
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Great video. I actually “locked in” to watch it full without distraction to prove myself that I can ( I have been lately a lot on reels and tiktok so it’s tough to focus). Thanks for the video it’s educating
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i didn't expect you to actually inspire me as much as you did, thanks :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Least obvious botted advertisement comment:
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "It gets a little easier every day. But you gotta do it every day, that's the hard part."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Great piece of media. Loved the avatar state reference
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 6:21 To be happy is to be at peace within and externally.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is SO fucking insane I JUST told my sister that 2025 is basically over so I'm basically gonna be 23 soon (my birthday is in May) because my birthday is next year and it's basically September and that means it's almost Halloween which is basically Christmas which means Happy New Year.  And being 23 means I'm literally only TWO years from being the BIG FULLY MATURED 25 and 2023 that was two years ago was basically yesterday which means I'm turning 25 tomorrow and I'm supposed to be married and had kids by like 27 or 28 so basically I need to have a house, car, be financially stable and get married by next week🙂    And she told me I have this "lock in" moment every 5 working days😭😭   And then I switch on the TV, go to YouTube and see this video....shits crazy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Using this as a reason to lock in six minutes in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 17:39 see this is why i didn't tell most people i joined the army
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You make good wants with Short term goals, like I know I wanna run a marathon, not only that but I wanna do mega marathons, rock climb, do a TON of crazy exercise to say that I did it. Thats a good goal, it makes me want to wake up every day and put in the work to make it, to prove to myself that I can do it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Enduring fulfilment vs instant gratification
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I liked this, somehow managed to watch the whole thing on 1x speed. a great reminder to keep asking WHY you want things
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Never felt so called out yet also so helped, thanks
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: consistency and discipline will always overrule motivation !
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: After the video I feel inspired and will lock in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think the biggest hindrance to actually "locking in" is people take it too far too quickly which leads to burn out. People do these crazy 4 am to 12 am schedules, they do well, then they crash and burn because well its not a sustainable life style.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Imma lock in on this gamblin grind  Let’s get it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also a key is pursue things you actually need. A need mentioned was meaning. Instead of making a business that you just want to make money, making a business that meets your need for entertainment, self expression, and impact. Instead of all your motivation going towards the end goal, structuring the pursuit into something that automatically starts meeting your needs and chasing your wants. If you dont evenly distribute the dopamine it wont last.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: They need to diagnose this it haunts my life how much I wanna be successful
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I always hear the term being used when we're playing games or something lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: IF I DON'T REACH THE STORE IN 5 MINS I'LL DIE
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: you changed my brain chemistry with this one, your loved ones are lucky to have you with how great you are at guidance
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I saw this vid from tiktok, and now i understand how I'll be happy, i give up on my wants and it's that simple and i will start living the moment as it is
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You just told everyone in this comment section that you joined though
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Hu_man_the_3rd use ur brain bro hes not ever gonna see any of us ever again
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it's true, I locked in from June to August 2024 because I relapsed and started smoking again, decided that end of September to start over and i did until December came and I went back to square one. It's been like that until today. I lock in for weeks or months if I'm consistent enough by exercising, no smoking, LESS alcohol consumption and eating well but I'm back to my bad habits. I've decided to start locking in again Monday
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video was actually really eye opening
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The intro is literally my life 😭 should I cry or laugh
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "They all mention the focus." *advertisement suddenly plays to distract me from the video* 🤣
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: IM SO LOCKED IN RN 5:30 am and straight to the GRIND
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This...this intro is hella true to the situation with my life the last 3 years XDDD
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: thankfully ive always had the ethic to lock in when needed and work on myself, but it really comes with if u really want it. If theres something you really want, if theres something you really want to do for yourself and something u want to achieve, you WILL do it. if you dont simply you just dont want it enough and theres things you have to really reconsider. I can promise many of you can think of things you done for something you really want but struggle to do something for a goal you think you want. Sometimes you gotta be real with yourself and if theres something you have to do but dont want to but NEED to improve yourself, than think about it in the way that your trying to improve yourself and make urself better everyday because every task under that category you'll have the motivation and drive to do it because your doing it to help YOU something you really want.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Didn’t finish the video but locking in never stops that’s the problem. We need to be spiritual fed to enjoy life
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you wanna get locked in, you need to go somewhere with no distractions and reflect.  What they don't tell you about the heroes journey is that the hero is actually fighting against himself. His shadow, his inner demons.   This is why you busy yourself with mindless bullshit. You're running away from yourself.   Take a hike into the woods. take no phone, no entertainment. Set up a tent, set up a campfire , cook some food, spend the night.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is making me emotional thank you for this masterpiece bro
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im watching this while procrastinating homework i fear that says something about me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I learned how to “lock in” as corny as it might sound by just doing it instead of making plans or telling myself I will. I just did it and if I failed I wasn’t to hard on myself like on the past when I would fail ide feel ashamed asf but I started thinking differently accepting my mistakes and recognizing that I was doing better than last time and I just continued grinding,working out,staying healthy and detoxing without giving too much thought. The reason why people fail is because they give things too much thought. Things have to come naturally not by force. Idk if I made sense but it has to be random and not because u watched some tik tok video. It’s like forcing a fat man who eats 30 burgers a day to eat salad everyday, he will relapse quickly if it’s too harsh and programmed instead if he just decreases portion till he cuts out burgers completely he will transform way quicker. This isn’t just about food obviously but it was an example
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'mma save this video to replay anytime i fall back
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This was an amazing video! Congrats!  And to the people who's reading this, for whatever reason, ik it sound crazy but trust me I experienced it on my skin & bones, even hell will bring you a lesson & help you grow as a person, help you see life a different way, help you achieve a greater you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am 14 weeks into my locked in arc, this time it feels different, I feel like prime Conor, I'm on autopilot
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Accidentally actually locked in. Down 12lb, back in school for my bachelors, tailoring my skills for a new job, planning on selling my house and moving to cali. Genuinely locking in can happen, but usually it's unexpected and all at once. Never give up, keep trying.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: another thing ive realised is there is no "better" version of me thats gonna go through the consequences off my actions, its me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was told I wouldn’t be able to do a lot of physical activities or sports because of how my chemo affected me. For a while I let it affect it, I blamed my inability to do certain activities due to the chemo, or if I was doing bad in school I’d blame it on the fact I missed 3 years of school from having to do chemo. Now tho, I’ve been focused more on my future and proving myself and doctors wrong. Instead of not doing my work and being lazy in school, I do my work and ask for help when I need it. When I get home I automatically clean my room and start homework. Now, I have almost all As and have a routine that helps me. I started taking a weights class to get stronger since I got so weak from chemo. Before I always said I couldn’t do it, couldn’t do a push up, couldn’t bench, nothing. I’m able to dead lift 100lbs and bench 85. For me that’s amazing and it gives me a big dopamine hit when I succeed. Now I’m stronger by the day and having good grades so I can meet my future goals
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Really solid advice out of this video, especially on not doing things just cause you saw someone else do it, I myself have had bad cycles of trying to "lock in" to impress or prove someone wrong, and at the end of the day, there is only so much you can do in life, so is best to prioritize working on one thing you want to genuinely do at a time, rather than doing multiple things to not want to get up the next day. Your why to do things can be the simplest thing, if it resonates with you and feels important then thats all that matters, just do a little bit of something every day and eventually something big will pile up. "I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times." -Bruce Lee
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: my problem is not knowing what exactly to lock in on, deciding on the one thing to involve fully yk,, i guess thats my " why" i gotta figure out
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: might be the greatest YouTube video ive ever seen fr
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: you should def put this on spotify
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: idk how much time i rewatched this masterpiece
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 27:46 thats horseshoe bend my guy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For me the most success I ever found was when I didn't have a goal and just had a vague on attainable goal so there was no fail state. The goal was just get healthier and learn along the way with a vague want of a Peter Parker body, and if I got it, I got it. if I didn't, oh well.  Then I got close enough to get the pictures and hung in there for a while and then I just stopped caring. Depression had a lot to do with it as well.  I had depression before this but it was a combination in perfect storm of events that Amplified it.  I think it was also the soul crushing realization that just because I looked a certain way, it wasn't enough to make me happy.  Still felt hollow.  Oh I also forgot to mention that a large majority of that motivation was off of Spite in unadulterated rage because of a stupid online comment.  Literally a single comment was enough to change my entire lifestyle, seemingly overnight, and get swol for like...2- 3 yrs.  In under a year.  I can get fucking psycho with little to nothing if provoked in a very specific way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Motivation is simply the spark that ignites the fire. The fuel is your self discipline and goals. Its just that everyone keeps on igniting with no fuel.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Me watching and storing it this using brain , and trying to fight my brain using what I watched 😭 , Brain be like: bro you not ready for this 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: thanks, i needed this video, trying to produce music for past year and this actually makes sense, even tho i can’t produce 100% of time with all of my energy its more about little steps that make the whole trail that leads to finish, thanks for the vid rly helped me out <3 :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I locked in back in 2023 and went from a skinny scrawny weak kid to a combat soldier that surpasses 99% of other soldiers in physical tests. Never felt better than that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Me watching this after saying I’m gonna lock in and write my research paper due tonight
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: THE motivational video to beat them all
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Locking in is like hyperfocus. What people are really missing is discipline which has some pretty heavily negative connotations but that's what I think most people actually want but have been kept in this short burst cycle instead.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It seems like this whole "on your own" thing is not for everybody to begin with, but then everybody want six packs, good stuff, shiny car, fancy bags
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Do you know how much effort it takes to to make these dopamine edits for a 30 minute video is crazy   It says something about our focus as millennials and genZ  If we ddnt have this crazy edit and it was a guy speaking for 30 minutes  How many views would it get
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also as a Buddhist I do a zen type lock in, not focused on exerting extra energy. But more so observing patterns and slowly and calmly shaping them until my natural baseline becomes organically more locked in. Rather than forcing change, acknowledging my inner states and cycles and taking advantage of my natural proclivities towards focus leads to long term permanent changes that aren’t draining. Its a longer path but more stable
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This was me jntil i finally started waking uo at 5 running to the gym focus on my academics more stopped beating it and more
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This reminds me of the show, breaking bad I think it's the best Series to demonstrate what you talking about both mr white and his brother in-law Hank are the best example of locking in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this is one the of the greatest videos i’ve watched all year 🔥
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Me and my boyfriend actually did the lock in thing, but, actually that wasn’t now Im done w tt and insta and next day I am A completely different person.  That was actually very, really a long term thing.  Like we deleted tik tok together  in summer- fall 2024, still looking through reels on instagram, but that takes Sooo much less time than for tik toks because the audience and actual content differ I would say much.  Anyway, during this time we didn’t restrict ourselves from doing some meaningless stuff for fun, we just slowly started getting into some of our hobbies. Found jobs, both of us which are surprisingly good and , yeah , minimum wage. But still fun, because more engaged in our hobbies like drawing and engraving. We actually locked in and got the progress in our lives , without pushing ourselves to do it. Maybe some of us actually have progress, but never thought about it, that’s ridiculous how society wants to see us constantly moving forward something much bigger. In reality it’s so much more than just the event of “graduation ceremony” or “wedding” That’s a life behind those words, ones on even yours.  You should be set to not only to your expectations but your limits and mental health.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Im hella jealous of people who fail because of mental weakness. I can never get too far in working out because I always experience pain. In my attempts to avoid injury I lose all momentum and its just as hard as day 1 again.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Many people (me included) are at a point where you are aware of your own situation and that you don't make progress in life. I don't know how to explain but I think I'm not the only one who is aware of his situation but even when you think about it you don't even have clear structured sentences or things in your head that help you further. You have an amazing ability to express yourself and i really envy that. You have helped me and I believe many others with this video, thank you very much.  English is not my first language I hope you understand.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I didnt even know what dropshipping was back when i was 13 and tryna make a 10k/month shop. Now im turning 17
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Brooo i started laughing out loud in the bus because the beginning of the videos was too funny 😭😭😭😂☠️
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thanks for being brutally honest. I needed this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: watching this right before i get back to locking in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Most people will put more time and effort into pleasing someone else, rather than focusing on the goals they have for themselves… damn
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ive hit rock bottom so many times, I've memorized my way back up to the top.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is a textbook definition of "regurgitated platitudes" 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I deleted tik tok on 2020 and I haven’t downloaded it since. I hate it. I hate addiction and I stay as far away for it as possible. Now, studying I have a why. But you’re right. I have to make that why stronger. Thank you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Man you took the words out of my mouth 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Keep making videos like this man. If you want to bring it more awareness put a face behind it. Because this is survival at its finest. I'm about to post a very important video as well about awareness
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this video made me lock in for a few hours
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wake up at Midnight was insaneee😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 9:54  is that why I struggle to sleep in past 6? Because I’m so excited for breakfast?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm gonna watch this video every time I need motivation, this is a masterpiece bro
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Our future was destroyed by those who were supposed to fix it, so now we'll fix it ourself
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the numbness phase ive been living it since 2022
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: lol the ending was so abrupt, i feel you on this. This is exactly the feeling I feel on my documentary I'm making, so many long hours and it's definitely tough and I want to give up, but it will work out, thanks man, genuinely.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 2025: waking up at midnight 2026: no more sleep. period.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Fuck a video , whats goin on behind the scenes . Thats where all the blood sweat and tears come from
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: One of the best yt experiences i’ve had in years
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Had a close friend ask me today how I stay so disciplined. Oddly, I don't think of myself as being disciplined enough, but I can see how it might seem that way from an outside perspective. The answer I came up with was not giving into temptation. When you think to reach for your phone, stop. Challenge those thoughts when they come to mind. Then challenge the justifications that replace those thoughts, and slowly, over time, it becomes more natural than the alternative. Be grateful for the progress. Be grateful period.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ah , this complecated brain thing is something we should fix
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i actually woke up at 4am today tho it's mostly because i slept around 8, i was so dead tired from work lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like you shouldve actually dove into the "short bursts" more. A lot of people will experience it without even trying, an example of this is when people work themselves too hard, and experience heavy burnouts, and confuse this for a moment of discomfort, and keep continuing to overwork themselves until they cant go anymore and shut down, physically or mentally.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: anyway im actually locked in. day 5 and im not stopping until im done. top comment says “discern what you want instead of goals that other people said should matter to you” exactly. this is what i want. these are my goals. nothing to do with anyone else. and im locked in.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: very good video. I can tell you know how to think logically. many years have i been struggling mentally because of this subject but your insights have eased my bad thoughts and given me new things to think about. thank you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is a very relatable and strongly pointed video Great videos man appreciate it. I would like to learn how to make videos like yours
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I can’t believe a video has sum up my life so well, specially in the beginning. Here I was thinking I was the only one who struggled with locking in.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Almost scrolled past this video but I’m so glad I didn’t. Just 30 minutes of genuinely great advice. You did an amazing job with this😝
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Don’t know how my mans doesn’t have more subs. Good stuff man you earned this sub

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: okay but the edits are soooo funny lollll
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: deleting tiktok was def the best thing I ever did
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The one thing you need that somehow OP managed to completely leave out is: Discipline. This video could/should have been 5 minutes long. That’s why you can’t stick with anything and yadayadayadayada.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This was a great video, thanks for sharing your in depth perspective. Very insightful😁

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was the same. Kept telling myself I would lock in and stop living life on easy mode,but I never did. Until Advanced level math. Now I’m forced to lock in, because if I don’t I’m going to fail my subjects🥰🤭🤭🤭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You should become a voice actor, love your video + thanks 😊
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's 1 am and I'm gonna lock in... Right now🗣️🔥
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Was playing sudoku while watching video am I cooked??
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Actually locking for a few years will lead to you finding how to enjoy the “grind”.  I feel that the real way to have longevity with these kind of things is to think about it as something “normal” and not “locked in”.  I have fun at the gym, I have fun working and it’s because I learnt to enjoy these things.  Make it sustainable and enjoyable cheesy ass quote but “It’s not about how bright the flame is lit, but how long the flame stays lit.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Great video, really eye opening for me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 3 months ago I was broke, anxious, and completely lost. My friend sent me Manifest and Receive by Eva Hartley and I read it in one sitting.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It was much needed, thanks bud!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I always thought i need to be rich to enjoy life. But for few years i asked my self why. And i found out that i hate being under management
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Taking cold showers every morning is the only "monk mode" thing I've succeeded in. In fact, I started enjoying them, not the process tho, the water is so cold, after 5 seconds of the water  my head hurts like a brain freeze from chugging ice water. But the shower takes 30 seconds, and after it I go from a drowsy post-sleep stage to a clear minded individual.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @malik peace mannnnn u rly summed it up well in terms of how it rly FEELS to be experiencing that mental resistance towards working towards ur higher goals. well done.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The Acquisition of the Vaunted 'Six Pack' is an Honorable Goal. Is a trophy that will reflect the Ultimate in Attention, Dedication, Sacrifice, Focus and Will. It requires Knowledge and Effort and Preparation and DEFENSE!  If one is to show Six Pack Abs, he understands the need for Self Preservation and learns about about the forces that operate against this outcome.  Indeed, he had tied his very Survival to This Goal.  Unless, he doesn't have enough energy.  Which is fine.  We Is what We Is. Accept it. Unless, you can't. I'm that case, Get To Work and don't stop.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There is no tomorrow, there is just this hour you are locked in, this moment only counts, that is jow locking in work. I am down to 60 minutes of written work a day and i consider that locked in. I dont do intense tension which is what gen z is obsessed with.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Great vid, thanks algo, I’m subbed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you for this. It feels like our own minds are being weaponized against us with all the modern pleasures. It's good to see this take on how our brains work and gaining knowledge on why it's so easy to let goals remain goals.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: holy fucking shit, YOU need to be WAY more popular
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If someone read 20 pages of atomic habits they would probably understand this concept pretty well. The author goes into his backstory on how his life was transformed not by one defining moment but by adding little improvements to how he lives everyday and continuing that for years. The concept of "locking in" is usually seen as a drastic change to ones routine but that usually not possible to implement long term. You need to start slow, for example if you want to lose weight start by going for a 15 minute walk every day or cut out 200 calories, stick to that habit and over time incrementally do more in your life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why i need to look in? I just need to do
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im going to site this vid at some point, this i swear
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is the best, most real video ive watched on youtube. Me personally, as a 15 year old kid, trying to make it in life like any other person also have that random burst of motivation that fades away quickly. But a thing that I've noticed between every single famous person or between the people that achieved their goals in life is discipline. Everyone knows it, but very few people actually commit to their projects because they dont have a reason to do so. This video explains that perfectly. And as a guy that has also tried all the things like having my own print on demand clothing store, dropshipping and reselling I've learned a lot of lessons, because I wasnt the person that just talked about doing it, I actually did it. But also, I wasnt the person that succeeded, I learned, spent hundreds of euros down the drain, got made fun off, while the others were spending their money on drugs and alcohol. But these projects taught me a lot of lessons. First of all, if it seems too good to be true, it is. Success comes with a LOT of effort and you dont see 99% of the effort another person put in to become so great. And secondly discipline is needed to achieve great goals, but dont forget your brain. Focusing on a goal and trying to pursue it is great, but dont forget critical thinking. If something is too saturated or if you see someone talking about it on the internet, its already too late and you need to know when to stop and changs niches. As i said, everything can be achievable with enough effort, if you focus on one thing for 10 thousand hours, chances are you are going to see results, but instead if you spend 100 hours searching for the right thing to focus on and another 5000 hours grinding on it you will achieve your goals quicker. Dont get me wrong, i think perfectionism isn't good but you can find good in anything at a certain dose or level. Mamba out
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Incredible video. Time to lock in...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Actually locked in, didn’t delete social media but I moved short form content to a far away screen to discourage myself from unconsciously scrolling and I only watch long content that I have to think about watching before watching. Working towards my goals and everything is going well. Lost 20lbs healthily. Doing great
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: when you hit a low so low you can’t go lower, the only place you can go is up and you know who’s up there? God.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There's a cultural thing here as well Westerners like to feel good we want to get 1st place in a race because of the excitement but what happens after the race many people will quit. Where's in Chinese culture it's less about feeling good and more about results obviously they want 1st place too but the goal is constant improvement after you achieve it they think about the next thing they need to improve.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: One of the best videos I watched ever.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Truly sir ill shall use thid information for greater purpose and growth thank you 🎉
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this video feels like a personal attack hahah
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm 20 I've been locked in for 4 years and I still feel like the goal is far far away cuz when I first started I estimated a 10 years timeline in my head to actually reach the goal  It's at leeeeast ten years not ten years on average  Now I'm at the point where I just wanna quit and become a housewife but im pushing cuz i still LOVE what i wanna become  but i gotta say it's getting harder and harder to close Instagram and makes me hate myself
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "GenZ is obsessed with locking in. Back in my day we half-assed our entire careers and now we just guild trip our children to take care of us."
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This perfectly sums up all of the thoughts I had about productivity. Thank you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The problem is people don't know what they want because they don't let their minds actually think with the constant phone addiction. Get BORED. Put that phone away for 20 mins and let your thoughts work. Do that daily and save yourself. No one is coming to save you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Start funny as hell love the video bro keep it up 👊
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: - figure out what you actually want and why (or turn your wants into needs) - figure out the actions to get it - remove as much of distractions as possible - do the actions
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 29 minutessssss jeez bro i dont think i got tiem like that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The two most-liked comments for this video have ruined my life.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Best "self improvement" video ive ever seen, thank you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video motivated me so much tbh 😭🔥
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you ❤ im gonna keep coming back to this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just feel like nothing matters yk
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’ve locked in for weight loss.  Saw 204 on the scale one day. Prior to that I could always say I never hit over 200.  Once I saw that I knew 250+ was actually a possibility.  I locked in around march and lost 20 lbs in may.  Got really sick mid May-now and kinda fell off (stayed on maintenance tho). But I’m locking in again  I tried to do everything in this video.  Lock in with: Waking up early  Reading more Saving more Making more Learning more With some success that never lasted over 2 months.   But I have a STRONG why for this.  I want to feel healthy. Be healthy. Look good. Feel good. I wanna enjoy being in photographs. I wanna go on more strenuous hikes.  I want to throw all my clothes away and buy new ones.  I don’t care that in a month I’ll have to stop wearing my rings I have on 24/7 sleeping, showering etc.  I also can’t wait to replace them later this year.  The $1,000’s in replacement items will be worth it.  I’ve given half hearted attempts like many over the years.   I’ve never tried this hard with such consistency   I’m too excited for my results for me to stop
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Great video! Any tips in discovering what you want?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you so much for that absolute cinema 🙏🙏🙏
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you. Genuinely. This video made me realize not only what I’ve been doing wrong, but that missing piece.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I been locked in for 6 years. What I’m trying to do takes time, it’s gonna happen
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've honestly been locked in my whole life; never told anyone, you don't need to. People will notice, eventually, and if you care about that you're doing it for the wrong reasons.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: one of the lock ins i actually did was deleting social media, its been ages without ig, snapchat, or twitter; and after a month its easy to not look back.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just wanted to say that this video is exactly what i needed to hear
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video is a gem. So relatable. I haven't ever watched something so relevant to my current situation. Truly special
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The way he made this video is great not just about how to lock in but the what it is made. Like its was made for short attention span but at the same time it trains you to not do that by adding texts that you needed to pause the video just to read all of it. Haha  Also im more of a visual person and i guess it works.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I love this, I want to loose weight, I need to look at it as I will be diabetic, if I don’t eat healthy and exercise.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: that and working out, beginning at elementary school; got a 6 pack by 8th grade
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Good video! The subtle art is actually a really good book. I'm trying to take what I am learning and apply it to real life. Makes you think
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Truth is... you don't need to luck in. I have build up myself multiple talents and my body as well. Just do consistent and gradual changes. Put couple hours of a week to something you want to improve. For body building 2-4h a week is more than enough if you are natural bodybuilder. Go twice a week and you end up looking better than most men within 1-2 years. Just take your time and be consistent. You don't need to sacrifice your friends and family.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this was an excellent explanation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: good now make one about gen z's addiction to reels
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: thank you for this video 🙏 this gave me some inspiration to lock in for today
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Amazing video! I learned a lot.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: had to lock in to watch this video
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Thank you man. I've watched a lot of dumb shit but this actually helped
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We can lock in just fine… Most people lock in on scrolling for several hours a day… every day
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I downloaded this video and transferred it to a Samsung on a deathbed and watched it 10 times without the internet
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Be consistent. This is everything.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video just explained the last like 6-7 years of my life. I can say confidently everyone should take the advice in this video seriously. I came to the exact same conclusions he pointed out in his video after many years. But here on YouTube you have someone who can explain it all in a 30min video. Great video bro finally not a con artist trying to get something out of me or someone trying to sell me delusions.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think I found this the time I needed too. Thank tob
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Good video I’m messing wit it fasho fasho
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I stopped smoking cigarettes this year. There are other addictions and wants I have to work on. But at least I know I can do it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this video made me want to lock in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This was well done and very funny 😅 thank you!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So much time is being spend looking for a perfect solution or a shortcut that will make our lives "perfects" to the point where we stop living. This time includes YOU watching this video right now...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Watching this in exam period btw🥀💔
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Paradoxically, I see locking in as something that’s been more challenging as we innovate. Everything has been more convenient and readily available that we grow accustomed to it so doing tasks that require delayed gratification is just ridiculously challenging. Not for me tho
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: how do i find goals tho? the whole 2023 i spent it trying to better myself and following self improvement but that path only took me to self hatred because why am i trying to change myself, am i not good enough? now im worse than before and no goals in life idk what to do in life, i dont want anything and i dont need anything so what do I do? Additionally, i hate this videos that tell you to "just do it" and i'll scream to myself "DO WHAT?!". And you cant say like "do what you want" because the only thing i want is to disappear.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: amazing video bro. i've learned everything you're saying through trial and error and this just helped my flame burn more than ever. ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this is the realest video ive seen
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Banger, you seem to have a good grasp on all this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The reason most don’t lock in is because it’s lonely. Most of your friends aren’t locked in so you will lose most of your friends. You won’t go to their birthdays or out on the weekends because your competition isn’t doing that. They will stop calling and texting you. Your world will get lonelier.   If your family aren’t world experts at what you care about, your family will also be alienated from you. You won’t eat the same meals or be awake at the same times as them, you will develop a different vocabulary and world view from them. You might move away. Your head will fill with different thoughts and your internal dialogue will depart from theirs until you become unrelatable.  As you deviate into the upper percentiles of the population at your given task, even strangers will see you as weird. You will have trouble communicating with normal people because you have little in common and spend limited time socialising. People will see you as an outsider because you are so far at the tail end of the distribution that they can’t relate to you. This goes for relationships where people you would otherwise court are impressed by what you do but don’t understand/ can’t tolerate to invest in that thing like you. Very few relationships are good for a locked in candidate so you will avoid most potential romantic partners.  Some avoid the issue by seeking out other locked in people and moving as one. Being part of the elite group might raise your game and you may be regain the feeling of social inclusion.   Two problems:  1. Elite groups are hyper competitive and you may need years of locked in isolation before being accepted. Most will not tolerate frequent social isolation for years.  2. You may not feel social inclusion among the elites. Elites can be pretentious, big headed, or cliquey. You might find them so intense that their behaviours are unhealthy, even if your association with them is improving your craft.  The last problem doesn’t apply to many people, but if you want to be the BEST, not just locked in, then you actually need to outperform the elites. In this instance they start seeming to you like your family and friends once did. As you look for competitive edges you relate to them less. Eventually, even the elites treat you with deference and caution, like  professional soccer players viewing Messi.     Now, hanging out with elites might actually hold you back from being the number 1. And there may exist another version of you who will make that sacrifice to beat you (e.g. Ronaldo). So you start earlier and stay later and do extra when others aren’t watching (like Kobe’s famous 5am workouts). There may exist no one like you at this point. You are unique and that’s a very lonely feeling.    That’s one reason why it’s hard to lock in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I got interested in the video, but when I clicked on it, and gave attention to the length of it, I almost swiped it away. It would have been so ironic to not watch a video about “locking in” and oh boy, this video gave me so much mentally, emotionally, even learned 18 new words, cuz I knew that this video would have more sophisticated structure. I wrote them down to quizlet to practice them. But why? Cuz I want to develop on my English, and why? Cuz I want to able to understand the langauge more, to get access to more educational, improving videos! The side texts were thought provoking too, but you didn't read them out. Thank you again, and be happy to live in a world, where a lot of knowladge is just a click away from us!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think this video might be about locking in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Once I was against a bunch of sweats teaming and I locked in,destroyed them all,and got banned for hacking.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 21:12 ❤ Sigh, this was my video for the day. Spoke to my self-doubt.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You are all locked in, and only I’m free
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Watching huberman podcast is so real 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: new vid on my reccomended, gotta lock in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: See’s the video is 30 minutes  *damn I gotta lock in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This was good to hear man fucking amazing video thanks
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is one of the best youtube videos i've seen all year. I literally am so grateful for you. Thank you for this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly, it breaks my heart how Manifest and Receive by Eva Hartley isn’t getting the attention it deserves. This book changed me. People need to wake up to this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: you are absolutely brilliant & correct
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bro tt is news education and entertainment that shit ain’t never leaving my phone
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: God damn we’re still so young 😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Watching this video instead of locking lmao. At least I’m up at 5 am tho
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you watched this entire video you have what it takes to “truly lock in”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the thing people dont understand is that to make a big change if you go all the way immedietly the longest youll stick to it is a week you have to take it slow gradual steps like if your trying to lose weight maybe instead of eating fast food learn how to cook and then when you cook your meals start tracking calories start lowering your portion sizes replace snacks with water then get a gym membership get a trainer or do research for a plan people always go all the way in when you have to start with the baby steps and then gradually make bigger and bigger steps up the ladder
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Basically this video is the summary of book by David goggings.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Find your obsession and you won't need to lock in.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i love u ur so great for making this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Amazing video, sooo well explained thank you!   This year!! I’m LOCKING IN 2026 IS MY YEAR!!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah !  im here because of that Instagram reel.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This lowkey reminds me of the movie click
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 2:49 - 3:03 reminds me of time in a bottle by jim croce
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: great points all around. I do want to add one thing in my experience for "locking in". That is, you should find dopamine in that thing itself, you can't maintain anything long term while being reasonably happy or content with life if you don't actually find yourself in that thing. It might take experimenting and failing but that's just growth, David goggins has injured himself in greivous ways over hundreds of miles and that can't be ignored. It just comes with the territory of the quest. If you enjoy the process itself, you will find it easier to persist past each injury, improving with each time to overcome and change permanently.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The thing is tho, with what I do, I can't remove my phone or my laptop lol, bc I need them to make my music. But great video man! Can't help but appreciate it. Fr
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We locked in tho, we be getting better every year
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Most people just aren’t disciplined enough. I’ve done more these past 2 years then some people have done the past decade. All about your mindset, dedication, and consistency.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Dude dropped the best vid just to end it with that's it bye 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Where there’s a will, there’s a way.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m holy inspired by this video and I’m most certainly gonna lock in this time!  One question though, is this an AI voice?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Aleight gang. Its time to go monke mode
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: doing nothing bothers me so much i always end up doing something
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I deleted my all my social unplugged my ps5, I’m 17 and I want to lock in. I can never stay consistent maybe a few weeks or months, I always mess up  But I’m going to give this a try again I turn 18 in 3 months on my birthday I’ll come back to this msg and see where I’m at   I want to prove myself wrong and become great because I know I can if I just lock in, try harder, be harder on myself❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Locking in = straight line inner stance, for those who read the straight line leadership book. Basically it means: set a goal, know what you gotta do to get there, and get it done, without falling into old patterns, regardless of how you feel.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey! I want to know has anyone found their why? I am struggling to find it. I mean can u tell me how u find it. It would help A LOT. Thanks. ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Entering uni this fall jumping right into calc 1 this semester. Im taking precalc online rn I have like <2 months to get ready.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I used to be so creative and have so many hobbies so after my first doomscroll back in 2020/2021 for 2 hours it felt like i lost some part of my creativity and it went downhill from there-
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "So we all have these thing called a brain" 🤯🤯🤯
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Great video thank you for this i needed ít❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The problem with the lock in trend is just cheap dopamine. People prefer in big prigress is short time rather than consistency. They want to be to belive, but you have to fully belive in order to be it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as a person who is mildly successful, i still don't feel locked in. im making $25/hr at 18, better than most my age, but what i want to do still feels out of reach. i cant do anything debt free without waiting 10 years, i want a family now but its expensive, i want my grandparents to get to be great grandparents. but at the rate I'm making money i wouldn't be able to afford the hospital bills in nine months depending on the cost of rent or the loan for a house. and my insurance is horrible i had to pay $3200 for medication last week and it wiped out my savings.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i actually am great at locking in but i gotta admit if you wanna truly lock in you gotta be completely deluded and be in the most surreal state of mind tho actually rn locking in for finishing a 20 page essay due tomorrow wish me luck
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Me indicaram seu canal ontem, muito bom, obrigado por existir, vou acompanhar ao longo da vida e usar seu trabalho de referência
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly never had the problem of not locking in. I simply lock in.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "WHO'S GONNA CARRY THE BOATS!!!"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I never had TikTok to delete. I’m just locked in.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I lock in all the time with my job and music
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i’m happy i found this video when i needed it most :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: One of my ‘locking in’ moments has so far been successful. I deleted Instagram over a month ago. Just can’t decide if I just delete the account itself in case I want to go back, but at the same time I know it did me little good so maybe I should.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What's wrong with meditation, cold showers or reading self help books?Maybe the goal can be better mental health or reading more or maybe they don't yet know what they are supposed to be doing so they just improve, and later on in the millionaire eg you said that pick a book,while a few minutes before that u called it a weird habit, quite the contradiction, still good video
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just Forrest Gump it. Roll out of bed one morning and decide to run across the country for years on end.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I deleted TikTok back in 2022. Without telling anyone or really planing to do it. It just happened one day after I realized that I will fail my exams if I don’t get rid of it.  Now I’m scrolling on Shorts…
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 9:19 you don't even need to live technically, you don't need to eat or do any of that, you need to if you want to survive. That's why it's important to have a why to live. You don't have to have that "why" right away, it's okay to doubt but cling to your reason to live no matter how small more than you do to the doubt.  You don't gotta be robotic and perfectly always have a why and never doubt, but choose faith over doubt.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Eso es mejor, muchas personas pobres ni siquiera tienen tiempo de pensar que quieren hacer, solo lo hacen
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's called Tunnel Vision, and it's a bad thing.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Here because of the upcoming 'Great Lock In' on Sep
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Lock in for me is just to focus, like get in the zone when your doin something. Idk i dont use tiktok
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Motivational bursts that we all are very familiar with, but this disease makes an illusion of our helplessness in the long term. You just start feeling like you lie to yourself every single time when you decide to "lock in". Well, there is actually the most straight forward method to avoid allat. Have you heard about all the distractions in the vid? This is exactly what you have to target for the most easy way to success. Your brain usually isn't able to handle so huge reasoning, cuz our needs and wants are running on the subconscious level and your consciousness is always intermediary, there is no way to change that. So to minimize the effects of subconsciousness  you have to maximize your consciousness' efficiency. It's much easier to follow some pre-accepted rules than processing them over and over again. More simply, planning is the best way of getting succeed. Plan what exactly you have to do and don't have to do. You can either use time frames or not, it doesn't matter that much. Just keep on tracking the basic rules that you've accepted once to make it to your goal, and you'll find yourself on the halfway there someday.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: yeah finally iam locked in and lost weight i still have alt to do but iam doing it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: if you need someone to tell you to lock in, then you're not locked in now that's bazed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 23:54 It’s a bit funny that I majorly improved art writing and animation because i love anime character Gyomei and there wasn’t much content about him
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just do it, if you truly wish it, your going to do it, if not, than mb your priorities are not in line with your wishes
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm grounded in my room I'm so lcoked in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: if bro talks about running again imma start to lock out
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I looked in in 2019 and in one year i went from weighing over 200 lbs to 120 lbs and visible abs and my why was i was shy and i work to work with people after graduating nursing school 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: just run every day and you'll start developing good habits
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 15:68 typo? Also, the single most helpful thing for me for getting done what I want to do and working towards my long term goal is having a good structure. I'm not someone that tolerates ambiguity well, so removing ambiguity makes me so much less anxious and productive. I also find that giving work to future me is easier than giving work to present me, so I give work to future me. When the time comes to do the thing past me told me to do, I do it because I told me to, and I know I'm on my team. I am a team of past me, present me and future me, and it's time for present me to play my part. That makes things feel less lonely as well. It's nice.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I guess they were all my years.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I want to complete my homework on time
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I locked the fuck in. No, I didn’t. I never said 2025 is gonna be my year. Locking in is useless. I, what, got a new haircut? Boom. I’m a new person. I have not picked up any new habits, I am the same person. But suddenly, I’m athletic, I’m a scholar, I’m hot, I’m loved. Locking in will do nothing for you, being chopped is your fate.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My fiancé and I plan to try and have kids in 2 years. So we decided to star getting better habits, less junk food, more excecise, drink more water ñ, etc. That way we both are going to be on better shape to take care of a baby and her body will be more ready to endure pregnancy. That became our "why"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 11:38 I felt this personally I’m 20 and I got 46k saved I’m tryna save 100k by 22 if it’s not about a dollar I truly don’t understand it 💯
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If anyone wants to overcome resistance I'd recommend "The War Of Art"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: saw this right after i said i was gonna lock in😔
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: we should change the definition of locking in, to actually mean commit
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: im locked in my house right now
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think this vid is perfectly edited in consideration of GenZs attention span!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The only thing I "locked in" to do was get good at Fortnite. I played all of Chapter 5 relentlessly, from the moment I woke up until I got so tired I couldn't fall asleep. I did this for the entire chapter basically, and it was not fun, but I forced myself to do it every day even if I did not want to. I was really determined to be good. I did eventually stop (And plan on starting again but have yet to dedicate a good amount of time to it). But I did reach my goal, I got good.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is a good video but it does fundamentally overlook the societal reasons as to why we struggle to "lock in". People historically have been engaged in periods of focus for quite sometime and the idea presented that we seek the easiest pleasure available to us is only true in a world where time is commodified. We actively asign time to value, to earn a wage is to say my time is worth the money being paid to me. However, because time and especially free time is such a commodity people do not have the ability to realise their goals. If given 4 days a week freely, boredom of the mundane and easy sets in and people begin to do things for their own satisfaction however, the 5 day work week leaves people either physically or mentally exhausted to where free time is valued as respite not as something to really be used to better yourself. This combined with the ease of access to entertainment, the convenience afforded to people by companies to keep you resting so when the week starts back up you're ready to go. "locking in" is difficult by nature but the society we live in prioritises the short-term over the long-term by nature, profits and revenues are measured in quarters, capital must constantly move and change hands to reinvest itself to create more capital despite the we can't have infinite growth on a finite planet.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this video can change my life , but does it?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I never comment on videos BUT I think this video is really helpful.  Let me help you lock in successfully this time:  1 - Decide what you are going to focus on  6 out of 7 days a week.  2 - Decide how much time you’ll put into it  3 - Decide what habits you should cut out and before cutting them out think of and imagine the benefits of the change. Whenever there is a temptation for the bad habit, just tell yourself “I’m not that kind of person” and immediately imagine, visually, the benefits of cutting it out  4 - Plan your rest time carefully. The days when you’ll feel the worst are the days when you haven’t rested properly. Plan your sleep schedule and do everything it takes to fix your sleep and the times you go to bed and wake up. Be sleep deprived for a couple of days in the start if this works for you.   5 - After you decide what and how much you’re going to focus on.  WHILE DOING THE WORK you’ll get NEGATIVE THOUGHTS probably every day. When they come YOU MUST imagine the results of the work itself. The place it’s going to take you, the peace it’ll bring, the confidence you’ll achieve when you’ve worked long enough. And when you imagine them, do it vividly - visualise.  6- Never ask yourself questions of the type- Is there a better path to choose? Do I really want the benefits now, that I’m putting all this worth? Is the effort really worth it? Did I really choose the best option? These questions should’ve been asked first. And before starting you 99% DID and you answered with yes when you started. Why say no now? I get it, you’re tired but you knew what you’ll have to go through and still decided to start. It’s too late now. Do not disappoint the you who planned the start by quitting now. Change has been made. You already decided and you’re the type of person who stands by his decision and takes his word seriously.   7 - When you’re locked in never live a day which you’d have lived before the lock in. Find new hobbies and how much time you’ll spend on them. Examples:  Scrolling - Chess, sudoku or learning a new language  Music - Learning music theory Going out with friends - Taking a walk, cycling, working out or talking to a family member.  Lust - Learning human nature, psychology and how to be more attractive to the other gender. When the s3xu4l thoughts come you must visualise your most disgusting s3xu4l experience and tell yourself - No, no, I’m not this person, I don’t need anything of that kind now.  Overeating - Putting more time to cook the healthy food in a good, fashionable way. It’s crazy what you can do with eggs, sauce, vegetables, butter and meat.  Smoking - leave the room every time you think of it and stretch your body for 5-10 minutes combined with positive goal-oriented thoughts.  Gambling - looking for good deals on items you have interest and knowledge in on online marketplaces. Searching for a good offer for an used iPhone from time to time is a good example of well-invested time. Who knows? This time you open the marketplace there can be a great, cheap offer waiting just for you - to resell and make profit or use for personal gain.  Sloth & being lazy - If you have it, the process will not be started in the first place. If you started, congratulations you don’t have it.  8 - Setbacks… The most painful part. You’re doing it, everything flows, you’re getting passionate and boom - a red light. You stop, wait, think and it turns out that this setback will be a part of the whole process sometimes. Remember why you’re doing it. Visualise. Solve the problem if it’s solvable or continue with a rock in the shoe regardless of how much it hurts your leg.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 2:33  When someone is young and not sure what they want in life, they set these unattainable perfectionistic goals so they end up feeling stuck and procrastinating tasks. Perfectionism kills. Maybe in my case

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just started moving my business forward so now when I slack and I'm not working, those payments will just pile up. I have to work to not loose money and the byproduct is making money
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Locking in doesn't feel like locking in. Feels boring 🥀. I'm still consistent on the goal tho. Not just a clear road, and rgn of progress.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Locking in is easy if you don’t do it with just motivation. Maybe a little, but you need discipline mostly. If you don’t want to, do it anyways. Tell yourself to get up. The more you do it, the more you fall in love with it. Another important part is you give yourself breaks. Not huge breaks because you’ll end up back where you started, but if you’re studying for 40 minutes, take a 20 minute break to watch one episode of a show or do something else you love. (NOT TIKTOK.) If you want good grades, it won’t just happen because of one “You deserve better for yourself” TikTok, you need to actually do what builds you up to that. If you have Fs, starting listening in class. Take notes. STUDY those notes. Most importantly, never miss an assignment. If you want to work out, do it. 3-5 days a week is best, and maybe play a show or listen to music in the background. Distraction makes time pass faster, which can make it the worst thing for you, but if you’re doing something like working out or cleaning, it can make that uncomfortable moment pass faster. Not to mention the extra dopamine when you’re doing those things will make you want to do it more. Getting better can be the hardest and easiest thing ever.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly the problem is that damn phone😔
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The problem is “the flesh”, an unwillingness to endure opposition or resistance.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: me and my buddies on discord say locking in whenever we're gonna work bro (work on games, for example doing the sprites)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There was lots of repetition in this video, but I actually think it was needed to get the real point across.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I feel like locking in multiple times is not bad, its a muscle you have to grow. Usually its not linear.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 15:30 … … “It’s been 6 months and we’r almost done building wells for dying countries” “yeah but wyd after fr” now to be real the water is the goal. Helping people, so it is also constant
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Pro tip: a sprinkle of self-loathing helps!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wake up bro, who is going to carry the logs to build the boats?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 2025 is my year though. I quit weed, I’m losing weight, and I’ve been lifting for 2 months straight. Somehow I’ve stuck to a diet fully more than a week, and it feels good actually achieving what I want. Now I just have to keep going for a while and I’ll be healthy af by 2026
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is so inspirational bro, I'm locking in starting TODAY
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: To get the real "happiness" you really want, you have to call it "responsibility". There is no raw or true happiness. Dont  search for responsibilities you want to have, search for them you'll need
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: While corny quotes are being mentioned one really helpful one for me is "If you can't fly, then run. If you can't run, then walk. If you can't walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward." --MLK Jr. I recently had the whole 'locking in' thing happen to me after personal realizations and discomfort in how much time I gave away on the internet thoughtlessly; coming away with nothing or even less than I had if I never picked my phone up.  The whole 30% effort and consist thing outweighing a 1000% effort but only lasting like, a week, is key. I've only been at it a month and have had multiple days where I felt like doing nothing, but what kept me going outside of rewards, easy set-up, or my 'why' not being strong enough that day is that I could crawl if walking or running was too much. Being the guy that shows up no matter the conditions rather than the guy who's spotty but hyped will always be better for the long term. In an interesting way I think it helps you trust yourself more; you're that guy. You show up.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When I think about "Locking in" I think about Locking Liquidity Provisions, not doing dumb shit and plotting how I'm gonna stop being a lazy fuck.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: we, yes WE ALL ARE DOING THE GREAT LOCK IN OF SEPTEMBER-LIFETIME
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I lock in… maybe 1-3 times a week for a few hours. Bc who tf can lock in constantly for months. Hell no, I’ll just do that when I actually need to or I’m just going to burn out
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The turning point is when you realize there is no “destination” or point where you will be completely satisfied with every aspect of your life. We as human beings are wired to always want more. We chase happiness in a way that ultimately causes us to be less happy. We all have goals inside our minds that we believe/hope we will one day reach. We like to think that when we reach this goal, we will finally be happy and content in life, and maybe it will “make us whole.” This is, for the most part, a complete lie. If you instead view it as “everyday is the destination,” you can begin to just enjoy your life right now, as apposed to constantly looking towards a future that you may never have, and comparing your current situation to your future situation, if that makes sense😅  for an example, I’m agnostic when it comes to religion because while I’m open to all possibilities, I don’t want to let anything take me away from my current reality. We don’t know what happens after death, that’s just a fact. We have no credible evidence to lead us to any conclusion of what might come afterwards. So instead of focusing on a certain afterlife or “destination,” I like to just focus on what I know exists here and now. If this is the only sentience I’ll ever get, and nothing comes after, then might aswell enjoy every second of it, and try to help make this world a better place for everyone.  My mom’s Christian, but she takes the bible very metaphorically. She believes that heaven is supposed to be here on earth, meaning we are supposed to make earth heaven, but we are failing tremendously at it. Even tho I don’t follow Christianity, I think this is a very powerful statement as I do think that absolutely should be the goal. Anyway, I’m ranting on, but hopefully this helps some people🤷‍♂️

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Something important about “locking in” is by sacrificing something in your lifr

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You gave up by now, didn’t ‘ya?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well... locking in requires you to develop the right internal (mental) alignment to your desired goal first... once you've done that, locking in on that goal actually becomes pretty easy. So: first the inner work, then the outer work. 🤯
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m a silly little person, I’m never locking in 😏

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Either you keep going or you stop
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah I locked in after I had a stroke in 2023 when I was 20. Since then Ive finished college, ran a marathon, and gotten a very good job. My motivation is to live my life in a way to where if I died today, would I be happy with where I was? Did I live a good life? Is it ok to leave? These are really tough questions to ask yourself that you don’t really understand unless you’ve been in a near-death experience. However once you realize, you’ll never want to waste another day. It’s such a gift to have the opportunity to be a human and experience everything you can before you leave.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: as a gen z, i can relate to this video.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Goals are not needed, just a peaceful lifestyle.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Isn't that just hustle culture repackaged?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ye nah I’m not even gonna comment my goal, it’s a personal battle and when I do comment abt it it’s when I’m successful and got enough momentum to keep going easily, goodluck and push through y’all! Write the main points of this video on paper and slap it somewhere you’ll see everyday like in ur room, it really helps cuz the brain forgets a lot.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Locking in is lowkey easy tho. Anything I’ve wanted to accomplish I’m in the midst of or have already achieved. How bad you want to achieve your goals? Having discipline helps tremendously
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah but the problem is that we can't because let's say in ideal universe person lives for a 100 human-years time. With all of this we have right now, that's not even 0.1% of possibilities we can explore and discover. Our universe is huge, but also we have one inside us too. We neither understand inside or outside. If you haven't I would recommend you to watch Mr. Freeman because it will show you some very useful information. It might be hard to find each video, but please watch it. Especially episode 61. Wish you all best, GOOD LUCK ON CREATING YOUR OWN FUTURE! Greetings!

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Locking in for lock in’s sake won’t get you far, do it because you want better for yourself, or to retire your parents, or to live balanced & healthy, or start a family. Find your WHY first, then your HOW becomes infinitely bearable & consistent.   “Give a man a purpose and the ability to achieve it, and he will crawl over broken glass with a smile.”

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 6:59 I disagree that this relentless focus on focus will never hurt you- Ive personally had friends that I felt I couldn’t connect with as deeply because they were focused on repeatedly trying and failing to “lock in”. It resulted in isolation, alienation, and a failure to realize true goals. Sometimes we just gotta free ourselves from society’s endless demands for us to meet its expectations and just go swim in a river yk? Go on a walk in a park with a friend. That’s the big harm of this “locking in” culture to me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Take action! Don’t be a philosophers coat rack. You have the knowledge now apply it.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Additional tip for your why, write it down and read it everyday because your brain will try to wipe it out eveyday. 😅
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Damn bro I got hot advice for you please use bigger text with black outline and better font
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: first step: understand your conditioning. everything in your life that lead up to who you are right now. breaking that programming is like trying to be a different person with different conditioning. if you literally woke up tomorrow as a different person, you'd likely go into psychic shock/hysteria when you looked in the mirror. changing your subconscious programming is incredibly difficult. even if your conditioning is hurting you. the other problem you need to overcome: people always perform better when they are having fun. what you find fun has  a LOT to do with your conditioning. you weren't born a gamer or a football player. you BECAME that (or something else). you may "wish you were" a this or that. but if you don't enjoy doing what "this or that" does, you will never truly become it. at best, you'll become a miserable faker and look back on your life with regret. the other big issue you'll face is understanding your conflicting desires. example: you want to have kids but you don't want to commit to a relationship because you're afraid someone better might show up and you'll regret your decision. how you (whoever you are) deal with these issues is up to you. but being aware is the start.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: the prince, Bhudda, did not leave his riches for meditation under a tree, he left them so he learn what it is to suffer, starve and sleep in the dirt. the enlightenment came after. i feel like u missed this crucial part of what "locking in" ought to be, not just focus but actively seeking out suffering. discipline requires pain but sacrifice reveals purpose. if you truly wish to be better, you must crave difficulty. stay hard.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh thank God I never wanted to lock in n God send a sign

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When I saw this video on my feed my eyes rolled to the back of my head. Gen Z doesn't exclusively have this problem, neither do they have this issue to much more of a degree than generations before it. This is a common and vital maturing phase in one's life as they learn how to channel their discipline rather than relying on a transient sense of motivation. And we shouldn't scrutinize Gen Z because they're beginning to become motivated and passionate. I mean, seriously? It seems like every idiot with a camera now makes sensationalized video essays about like every trivial thing Gen Z does as if they're reporting an apocalypse.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The only people I am aware of that can 'Lock in' and get weeks worth of work done in a couple days are people with ADHD, and its not Locking in its Hyper-focus often to the point of them sacrificing their psychical and metal health to avoid the fallout of their executive dysfunction disorder
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Judging from the beginning of the video. We’re all essentially cowboys fans lol. “We going to the superbowl this year”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My recent animation.... 13mins long... It has more animation than all the animations I've ever made in my entire animation career combined..... It took three months of making about 400 sketches daily.... It was painful... I hardly slept  It was a personal project that basically brought me $0... I did the scripting, voice overs, character development, sound effect video editing and everything... It was overwhelming for me.... After finally dropping the video it felt like I dropped a truck and my legs gave out... I've not animated for over a week now from emence burn out....
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That is an entirely different situation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its like before we couldnt dispel with the notion that generation z is the 'addicted generation', as if every new trend or phase propagated some new form of instant gratification as a byproduct of a generational motivation crash, and now as this generation finally makes it cool to try again we immediately downplay their motivation as an addiction AGAIN 😭

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 23:09 – 25:50 Well, then it seems most of the things I'd like to “lock in” for won't ever be done. I'm not a motivated person, and the more I search for this magical strong “why” I only see why I SHOULDN'T do whatever I wanted to do.  Nothing will be done.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I weaponized my ADD and I lost 24kg (from 113kg) by choosing lazyness, forgetting to eat above eating poorly.

I went into my bank to disable fast food deliveries and I know my fatass don’t want ro walk 5 min to my local pizzeria.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Heyy. I just wanna share that I'm actually hitting the gym everyday since two months ago. My strong reason why it's because os a depressive episode in which I felt disgusted by my image. I'm still struggling to feel neutral when I just can't go (I usually have meltdowns when I find out), but i think it must be at least a little good, no?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: - It's supposed to be boring. - The reason why you can't lock-in is because you don't have the why. - Our brain is wired to choose the easy-way, doing things without the why will make your primal brain against you. - Any why can be answered with how. - Social-medias bombarded our primal brain with never seen before techniques of obtaining dopamine. - They essentially messed up our brain, that although we want to lock in, we can't, because our brain is fucked up. - Don't fool yourself by announcing (and other kind of signaling) that you'll lock-in, just do the damn thing. - Showing up 10% consistently is better than doing 90% but only for weeks. - Keep asking why, why, why, why, and make systems on how to achieve those whys (research PACT vs SMART goals).  These are what I got from the video, might add more after rewatching it.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think the video had a lot of good advice, but I also disagree with the magical why notion. When I do something challenging for a long time, I don't often have a grand "why." For me, I start because I just want to do it. And then, I keep at it because my "whys" evolve with the goal. Like, let's take learning an instrument, for example. Why? Because I wanna. I like music. I start. I learn a couple very basic ass songs. Then I want to try more complex stuff. And my whys keep changing. First it's "I want to learn this harder song because I feel accomplished when I pull it off" and later "I want to learn the lower register so I don't get tripped up by random low notes" and then "I want to play faster so I can play that awesome video game song" and later "I want to learn notes by ear so I don't have to use sheet music to play anything"  There's no grand goal. Nothing like "I want to be a famous musician" or "I want to surpass so and so" or "I want to impress someone with a specific song." The goals, my whys, just shift as my skill improves. The first why is just because I wanna. That's it. I think whys that evolve with your progress are more realistic than starting with a magic why bullet and expecting just that to carry you to the end. Granted, he kind of touched on that with the Y squared thing, but I don't think it was emphasised enough.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The thing that made me stixk to it and actually start losing kilos a week was slow change, bwcause that is easier. When I was locked in I promisef myself chicken and rice everyday, gym 3 times a week and 3 runs a week which yeah nah I didn’t do, but no fastfood first month worked, portion sizes 1 month worked, keto 1 month after those worked, and then I was down 10 KG already. Now I’m locked in shitting and watchong this video, I’m promising myself going to the gym every saturday when I’m free and that whenever I feel like shit or like I have bothing to do, I will go. Then we’ll see.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Got 2 jobs. Work 70 hours a week. I cant get more locked in than that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i know joe bartolozzi is gonna watch ts
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I actually locked in and I make a lot of money doing landscaping …. Deleted all social media . Didn’t graduate high school in my low 20s never let your foot off the gas
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I use to work out to get big and juicy and increase my "sexual market value" but now if I don't my back, feet, shoulders, fall into disrepair.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Idk mate, I don't have dreams, I only have thoughts, I don't feel that need of doing anything
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why not work towards your goals and THEN scroll on tiktok after you're done?? I've adopted this habit, and now I am the breadwinner for my family.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Nah man. Im locked in. Im in collage to be an art director. I will be one. I only have one year left of study. Its fucking hard but i want it so badly.   That said... ticktock is cool. But it steels my time. I dont have time. I have 1 goal right now. Well i have 3 main goals.  1. Graduate 2. Be an art director and create beautiful campaigns (i am under no illusion that the job will be easy)  3. One day i will paint freely. Massive meurals. Paint is really expencive and i need money to do that. And time. Lots and lots of time.  Im going to lock back in now. Cheers ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes, the easiness of modernity is a killer of greatness, but is the extreme opposite "reality check" of what it takes to reach our goals also a killer? The focus on the end becomes so "locked in" that we forget that the journey itself is where depth and meaning exists if we remember to stop and look. Like the Grand Canyon example. The snapshot you have of it now, as a mental visual image, isn't the end of its journey. Every day, rain still falls there, mice push rocks around, life exists, unfolds, dies, and decays there, changing it slowly but surely. All that is what MAKES the Grand Canyon, not MADE it. It's an ongoing process, sometimes quickly, other times slowly, but still evolving. It seems to me that a very important aspect has been lost in looking at the extremes.  Most people don't know their why because they don't even know their goal, and this is where I then have a problem with the "extreme reality check". Being told that only goals worth walking through hell to achieve are worth our attention is as much a killer of finding depth and meaning as doom scrolling is. If we're so focused on finding a "worthy" goal and a why that can survive the how, will that alone limit our snapshot of "the end" possibilities to become the next problem in finding a goal: Only to look among those that will surely cost us the most discomfort. Where is the room for life, for depth, for meaning, for the love of the journey. Why do we treat our lives as if they're modeled from the new modes of productivity that arose with the industrial age, where everything can and must be tracked, measured, weighed, and optimized? That's the killer of the human experience. That's why we doom scroll. Because we forgot something that has no room in the world as it looks today.  Buddha once held a sermon where he remained quiet but only held up a flower. Those present stared at it in deep contemplation to figure out, what lesson there was to be learned. And then someone smiled. That one person understood. A moment to breathe and exist and simply live.  There's no room for that in either extreme set forth here. Maybe the goal should be to remember to stop and smell the Daisys every day.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm such a lazy person, but when I try to lock in then I start to overthink about that and can't even sleep after like 1 month the activity that I was trying to lock in... I just got burned out and forgot about it.. like learning chess or try to make content on youtube.. The discrations are destroying me in a way I need dopanime rush to even work in daily life.. If I see somebody with big numbers like views I would try to copy&cat in a worse way.. the question is how to focus without distractions and overthinking?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If you was that lazy to watch the full 30 mins, pretty much what he said is the reason you cant lock in is because   you don’t have a strong reason to lock in or to achieve whatever is it that you want   And because you don’t have enough consistency to lock in over a long period of time even if your performance was below average
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Naw! What you said is exactly the problem.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Like I always say, what does Nike say to the kids of Vietnam working in their factories… Just Do It
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've been locking in since 2019 but still not delete TikTok :/
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Okay, I think I'm losing it with gen-z. I thought locking in meant flow state/zen mode/hyperfocus.... which is really easy to slip into once you know what it is.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was 22, when theater taught me how to actually lock in. It feels frustrating knowing i could've achieved so much more if i learned how it's acually done instead of sitting and thinking about cool things
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: personally my experience with "locking in" started the Same as everybody some random tiktoks video i know some people who just scrolls away and take it seriously for two days,i started really "locking in" within month PROGRESSIVELY Thats why most people dont understand it takes month,years to "fully" Lock in and locking in every day not Even a single error in your life is not possible Even if socials media seeks this as locking in its juste fake,(just wanted to share my experience with it,pardon for my english)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I actually deleted all of my socials I’m trying to be better and Less distracted
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also these habits guides are misleading, maybe it’s just me but they seem to advertise that building habits are as simple as just making sure you do it consistently for month or two, then it will magically just be “automatic” and will stick for rest of the life (which it won’t) - anyone else relate?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i know it sounds stupid but just do, don't think or you'll have enough time to find an excuse.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is nice but kinda hard upon a perfectionist like me 😢I mean I don’t even watch movies now (l live them) thinking I can use up time that for reading something 😢
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: People can’t lock in because they do it as a way of self-detachment.  Instead of listening to themselves and trying to understand what’s inside, they enforce “grind/monk mode” on themselves, they “lock in”.  In the end your inner self will sabotage everything you do, if you keep ignoring it.  Try asking yourself why you do not want to “grind” for something. Instead of ignoring and forcing yourself to do it anyway.  These kinds of videos just reinforces this endless cycle. Because they imply shame and self-blaming.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Cool video, but did you speed up your voice?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yo preferí abrazar la incomodidad con dolor a diario cuando entreno algo en mi rutina debe hacerme sentir dolor casi siempre es hacer lagartijas con los puños sobre piedras o legos para así acostumbrar a mi cuerpo al dolor y quieras o no a sido para mi gusto la mejor decisión ya que esto a hecho que siempre pueda llegar mas alla del fallo en los entrenamientos
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I am locking in but still give myself the freedom I need to not burn out. I wish to be an bio-engineer to find solutions for a sustainable and eco friendly environment. Even when I can help bring humanity just a tiny step forward, I'm happy!  Or well... Design and build beer breweries because I'm German
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Don’t focus on more than one thing at a time you will just overwhelm yourself. For example (I want to take cold showers every day then run and quit smoking and social media and and and…) Take one pre 2 months and make one thing a habit, every day make that thing your must do, for me that was cold showers, now I’m going in to no fap then I’m going to cut sugar.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: we have to work 2x harder for less rewards
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video made me do pushups - i know i wont do any more pushups for months

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 7:00 why does that guy said nice?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: its time to lock the fu- ohh what is that thing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There is no clear goal to strive to,our great depression is our lifes
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: But if you lock in on learning, what could stop you? What if the blades of grass live in symbiosis with each other and benefit from each other? Don't be so narrow-minded. What I learned from drawing helped me a lot in making music. And what I learned from learning these things gave me a head start in learning how to build my own business. What's even more important, I was happy while doing it and didn't have to constantly force myself.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s all uncomfortable. I like that :-)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ironic that i found this video by doomscrolling
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: atp what are we not addicted to

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wow bro, said now is the only thing that matters because the past and future is not exist
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I locked in 161 days ago with semen retention,kundalini yoga and a new healthy lifestyle I will become the most powerful yogi on earth😏
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video makes me sad, because it makes me realize that I cannot change hahahah
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I literally can’t fight this dumb ass identity bro, I’ve locked in twice so far (December 2024 and January 2025 cuz I took like 2 weeks off to do BS bad habits) bro I’m 15 I fucked up my GCSE’s. I can’t even cope no more I straight up just allow myself to not change even if i gets the thought too. I could but not matter how hard I try to convince myself I won’t.  Edit: ig it’s doable
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 2:22 - Run past that same deer every other day!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Damn... I swear I was locked in before seeing that deer. Starting the video over now. This is insanity.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Your brain needs dopamine to function. No dopamine = no focus = no lock in. Big issue for ADHD people. Drinks and snacks during activities can help drip-feed dopamine. Good luck and cheers to all.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This made me hate my brain so much 😂😂 this dude be bullshiting our lives men😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Their addiction is their feelings and believing the world is responsible for their life.  Plus, being addicted to the internet.  It's sad.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: you havent heard of this thing called adderal im guessing?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What is the name of this sound effect at 3:59 , 4:03 etc?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hasn't this happened with every generation tho
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 2:59 this video is so depressing, let’s see where it goes
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ive already given up on that lie
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So basically what your saying is we need to make our "wants" into "needs"?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: bro i acc got rich in crypto and also finally my lock in didnt crumble this year LOOL
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well it depends in the country that you live in too, if everyone has the same mentality you would also be affected too, now imagine if everyone was actually motivating and always helping each other? That would be cool, but in a world where inflation happens and prices getting higher, the poor getting poorer and the rich getting richer, and how the internet is being more normalized now, everything being automatic, and the demand of job employers expecting you to be  perfect, meeting societies expectations, it's just too much.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Atomic habits is far to relatable 😫
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Take away from this video, “locking in” isn’t a bad thing, it’s just an overused term that most don’t actually do.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 29:52 i get closer to my goal every single day, great video
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The problem is that people plan a very drastic change to their life overnight, do you really think that you will start going to the gym 4 days a week after staying in bed for the last 10 years? no, u probably won't even start and if you do, it might not take much time until you quit.  The key is to make small steps, today I will do one push up, today I will study for 5 minutes, today I will move that old pile of dirty clothes from the chair. That's the real road to change, small steps that you might not even consider as REAL steps cuz they seem too small, too insignificant to count towards anything, but that's how you do it, with very very small steps, over a long period of time. It took you years to get to the point you are now, it will take years for you to get out.  That's the change, you don't start moving mountains, you move a pebble each day, if you can't even move pebbles yet, that's ok, move dust.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this problem is not just in our generation, its called procrastination and planning things you never do. People have been doing this for generations atp) edit: u mentioned it later in the video lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How do you walk 1,000 miles? one step at a time. focus on actionable small steps instead of trying to transform yourself overnight
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i got bored and switched to tiktok during this video, am i cooked chat?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not nobody, I know a few people my self who do "lock-in" it is just a majority of people who are too lazy and lack the discipline ( and/or will power) to make a change.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ironic when big YouTubers make videos like this when you yourself had to lock in to get to where you are now. YouTubers will grind to get bigger, but then turn around and til you “you shouldn’t work, just manifest “😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was 255 pounds and i lost 60 punds in 2 months By accident now im 190
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I find it insulting (no I don’t) when he said “im going to put everything in NFT’s,” I actually did in 2021 and made a whopping $500,000. Even this year I made a great $13,000,000!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Most people, including me do that, but everyone is stupid. One step at a time is the go plan. You can't make drastic changes in your life in such a short time period.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: meditation is good though. do it daily and you're mental health will probably become better
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Everyone wants everything. That’s why
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 18:45  Are these books good reads?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: wait cold showers are actually effective😭😭
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This coming from a millennial is crazy lol we went from "flow state" to "locking in" to "addicted to locking in" and at this point the original meaning has been long lost.   It's like comparing apples and oranges but you forgot what apples are. It's not locking in, it's survival. And oh boy, are we surviving.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i know what kinda man you are. “day 67”
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Everyone want it but not everyone’s willing to do what it takes to get it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Sad fact: most of the people watching this will still avoid taking any consistent action and their life will still be the same in 5-10 years.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Locking in is meant to be spurts. Like a day max, a few hours of work hell even 30 minutes.  Locking in is strictly for short term goals. There's a different term for long yerm
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 23.54 why did you say rip to  kobe but not to walter
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: video started pretty well, but it just become a repetitive rant after a while (with a nice voice, I’ve got to admit)

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: https://youtu.be/lbtte7iTS9g?si=NV0TXdTtsxSXtcR1  This is the best video I've found in terms of how to be more productive. It gave me the mental framework on how to improve any facet of my life.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You know who else is addicted to locking in?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video is Stage 8 brain rot
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Ehh even you mentioned that locking in for 2 weeks can help you pass a test. So short term locking in is helpful. Maybe ur goal for these 6 months was to pass that test. As long as you lock in and pass the test you can take a month off to think about ur next goal or enjoy the reward from that test
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: why not do something you 'dont want'
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: cultural change hitting hard this 2025
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Great video.  Just pointing something that bother me: y^3 is not the same as y^y^y. this hurt me greatly lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is the call for everyone in these comments to delete their tik toks, it’s very easy. Delete it from the phone and then hide your App Store in a folder somewhere
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Have you seen the story about a school that turned fascist in 5 days?  That's literally what is happening here. Between religion and political topics. Locking them in to a "life or death" state of mind over whatever topic they find an interest in. This isn't about votes anymore. This is about civil unrest.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: interesting, So our brain is our enemy. So we are our enemy 😃
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This might be the first video that ever moved me in this bloated mess of motivation content. This wasn’t motivation content, this was a wake up call. There is a fine line between those two, and it can make a huge difference depends on who it is that sees this.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah tiktok is the newage  vine except its not good 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The concept is flawed, just do things, don’t overthink it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: American society has fallen into its era of disparity. We are watching everything from the past unfold, something big will happen in the future, but America is truly falling from grace, slowly. Mass complacency, corrupted government, same sex relationships, child pedophilia, mass homelessness. It’s all unfolding before our eyes. Not much to do now… time is taking its toll.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Also it’s bad to look at it as “locking in” I’ve had the most success in my life just trying to follow God and try to do what makes the most sense and embrace challenges. The only rule is to keep moving, if you’re not doing anything then start with doing something You don’t have to sit in the chair and lock all the way in to be successful
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When u have a generation with poor attention span "Locking In" is the bare minimum
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Is it only me that I can't watch the video for the soul reason of too much happening on the screen? And I am a Gen Z guy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bro made a 30 min video about nothing and I watched it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m going to tell you the truth locking in is hard and nobody does it the first try but guess what they do they “Try” for example you wanna stop beating you go 6 days no beating then you slip up. What does that mean give up because you failed? NOO! Just keep trying people who locked in just kept doing the thing they were locking in on until it became second nature I promise you it’s that easy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “Self improvement is mastvrbation.”

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Are you sure that doing something obsessively is productive? I have several examples of high achievers that didn't lock-in: René Descartes for example used to wake up at 11AM and often he slept up to 12 hours a night. A Fields medalist June Huh says that he does research just 3 hours a day and that he sometimes even forgets to go to give lectures. I have a university average grade of around 75% and my last exams I had a grade of 90% and 97% while studying in a busy bar instead of my room for the written and oral part of topology and abstract algebra 2(ring theory, elementary Galois theory) because I wanted to have fun.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Video too long for my attention span, can anyone give me the short hand?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's cocaine and ritalin. 90% of the people who are that focused are using stimulants

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: coulve ended the video at "locking in is unatural". the problem is modern society
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Spending money helps lock in. If you buy a gym membership you'll probably use it. Unless you have alot of money then go to a expensive gym
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Um it's been a week are you still locked in
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: he's arguing against the "locked in" mindset and arguing for consistency. maybe you should pay attention
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I scrolled so far to see someone say it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's ok. Continue your brand if its something that you love doing. It's best to use videos like this one as a guideline not a set of step by step instructions.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 2:53 Romans 7:15 NIV — "I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do, I do not do, but what I hate, I do."  ONLY GOD can produce true transformation in us to do the right things! seek God first, He can help you! ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: being able to lock in in the first place is a good sign when people say lock in they usually mean focus/ get into flow state,, i mean no offense, ive never touched social media, unless you count discord , i use discord for as my primary messaging medium but i dont go aimlessly scrolling til my brain feels rotted, im a gen Z but im probubly just an outlier,  i do watch youtube aimlessly here and there but its worth it when i find a cool new content creator with more than a TV show's worth of funny and entertaining content( like "vinesauce; the full sauce"'s corruption stockpiles or "little kubirohs"'s "yu gi oh abridged"  for examples but of course who doesen't watch youtube these days?  TBH i only watched 2 mins of this video before i lost interest so im likely missing important context brought up in the video to even have a valid comment xD this video just reeks of existential dread or the feeling of lacking a purpose or inspiration, my purpose i chose is making as many good memories as possible with my old friends, if not that just a satisfaction in mechanics i" locked in" to type this comment because i happen to be gen Z your likely not gonna win anything competitive if you dont lock in if your not locking in your were probably never that invested i the first place, again being able to lock in is not a bad thing by any means, this video needs to find a word for this fake brainrot version of locking in its trying to explain, i think it would get the point across better, i friggin loved the journey getting through kingdom hearts 2 at level 1(defense build) critical mode if thats not called locking in idk what is
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Slavery has been abolished long time ago. But it worsened coz we're now slaves to ourselves.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: we all have certain things we want to improve about ourselves, it doesnt just have to be career wise. plus instant pleasures will just bore or numb you on the long run. the same numb feeling you get after scrolling on tiktok for the 3rd day in a row
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i found if i played a game too much even if i was still performing great due to feeling burnt out my expectations id have set for myself could get absurdly high to the point that even demolishing the other team/opponent didn't feel like winning
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I only wish i had freedom and not have to explain my self or sht to my mom and wait for their permission. I am 25 and i am treated like a stpid betch who cant do sht.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bro Simply just search up the law of attraction. You gotta have a different level of obsession
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 6:57, because people doesn`t have discipline
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it all goes back to 'why'. this is the reason behind people who has a tough live growing up, like rural people achieving a lot in their lives. it's because they have a tones of logical and emotionally charged 'why's that would push them through everything it takes. like you say you wanna work out, but deep down it's just the influence of that one crazy dude tweaking on bench press and phunk music on the background, you don't actually have a genius reason for doing something. you look at yourself in the mirror and say I'm pretty much fit, not fat and not skinny, why would i need packs when I'm already ok?. or you had a relatively good life with some bad economic years or months, you look at your wallet and say meh why would i press myself to get rich when I'm already ok with my life, eating three times a day, have a bed and a decent housing. it just doesn't push your brain to lock in on life because you can't even find a good reason for it. some people fought in wars because they were freaking starving and had nothing back home, 10 kids and 3 wives waiting for him, he is basically a beast on the battlefield ripping through steal to get that booty and take it back home. but today in this day and age, majority of us are well of and all of our primal needs are met, we have no one waiting for us nor we are starving to death, basically we are like kings and dukes in castles that leave lavishly and basically don't have any reason to improve or get their sh tougher.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: difference between me and the other Gen Z is that o stay to my word. everyone else has their dopamine receptors all messed up, it's sad
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Moreover, the locked-in's result is never paid off immediately. For example, you decided to do the video, but only a few people appreciate it. Then you found the other channels did it better than you and you think you're not cut-out for it. Locked-in is suffering all the way down, and you are never sure it will pay off. But logically, it is the best bet one can take in life
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: For me it’s drawing. No more doodles all day try to make something that takes time
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: very hard to find the why for me
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The maintaining a speed a that you can maintain is so real I was struggling with locking in and saw a video that used some to ing like that as an example and it helped me to do 20 pushups everyday that was 6 months ago and since then I started running everyday for 30 minutes but I’m small steps and those small amounts of gratification are what kept me going and motavation doesn’t create success. Success creates motavation
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I find this video so contradictory talking about constant distractions whilst having multiple clips, memes, sped up videos cutting every second or two to keep your brain stimulated,   I respect the hustle bro but you can’t genuinely think this video helps people when your doing exactly what your speaking against.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 😂 I accidentally locked in this year though.  It wasn’t even a resolution, I was drunk and high and realized the last time I was genuinely happy was working this specific job and immediately applied to 5 colleges (it was literally midnight and took 3 hours) and I got in! I stuck with it and am going to college! I’m already studying and am testing out of a few classes to save time and money
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Study Taoism. Practice Wu Wei and you’ll actually make progress.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: W fucking video bro. I caught on to the way people gloat about “locking in” on socials to look good for others, glad to see i’m not the only one who’s noticed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Everything is some stupid trend or movement for this new generation 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is very damaging advice if taken at face value. To make a want into a need will lead to burnout and self destruction when that want isn't stable nor achieved, that kind of low background stress leads to shit like ptsd, no joke. It sounds dramatic, but ask the suicide rates, it's very real.  And removing distractions. It takes a lot of introspection to realise when a distraction (like a hobby, or friends as stated) is a hindrance and not something that promotes dopamine essential for functionality.   Balancing your dopamine and cortisol is essential, a lack of balanced dopamine and cortisol is what ADHD, PTSD, memory impairment + impaired retention, catatonia, depression, anxiety is...name a mental illness or condition and it's likely to do with those two chemicals.  In phychology terms, the struggle of locking in is executive dysfunction, for people with neurological deficits like ADHD or depression, stimulants or receptor blockers are administered to balance the amygdala and repair the frontal lobe's functionality. For regular people, I suggest L-theanine and caffeine to get that kind of chemical regulation if you're fried from social media or otherwise.  For mindset, start your day. Just start it. It doesn’t need to stay started, you can go back to sleep afterwards. But first take half an hour to do some introspection. Get rid of most of the grogginess of waking up and ask yourself "do my needs feel sufficiently met this morning?"/"what needs need to be met?"/"do I need factor in time to decompress?"/"do I feel good enough to go in self directed or should I take 10 minutes to structure my productivity session?" This establishes your baseline for the day, the time frame for your needs, responsibilities and your productivity or "locking in". and of course takes the cognitive burden off you at the start so you're not slowly burning through your brain power trying to self direct your productivity during the lock in and manages your expectations for the day.  You don't need to punish yourself to get results, you just need to know yourself as much as your brain does. It's not an impossible task, and it's one that can help in all areas of life. Think about the science, the logistics and the plan. Not the pain, the pleasure and the dream. Unless you're a masochist, idk this is the internet there's gotta be at least one weirdo reading this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's normal. People have been asking the "why" question for thousands of years. It's something that every human being will have to wrangle with. Eventually, we all will come up with an answer.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @VimOneLove  the sooner i find it the better, dont wanna live a few more decades without any dreams
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I’m so glad I’m not one of these Tik tok addicted braindead losers
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: where the 1 second long clips necessary, oh right rock attention spanned generation....
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There is only one God who created the heavens and the earth. God made us in His image. God made us to worship Him, but we chose to rebel against Him. As a result, we were separated from God, but God did not abandon us. Instead, God sent His only begotten Son, Jesus. Jesus was born of a virgin and, like us, He lived a sinless life, despite all temptations. Jesus took up His cross and willingly bore our past, present, and future sins. Jesus died in our place for our sins, paid our debt to God, and purchased our salvation. Jesus died, but rose again the third day, having triumphed over Satan, sin, demons, and hell. But now we are called to repent and turn from our sins and to live for Christ and His glory. He set us free from sin not to sin so we can experience the true peace He calls us to have in Him. In this world there will be suffering but with Christ we can have peace and hope throughout it all because He has overcome the world. We have a God who lovingly pursues us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Half you kids just need to join the military.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You struggle to lock in because of capitalism.   1. You're trying to lock in in a system that enforces you to put yourself second, and capital first. If what you like doesn't earn money, it's worthless. What feeds your soul comes second to monkey paper. Remember that this feeling is as cheap as we make it.   2. You're overworked. 8 hours a day which is actually 9 hours since that hour of lunch isn't free time which is actually 10 hours because during your commute you don't have free time which is actually 11 hours because we need to cook and clean which is actually 12 hours because we need to take care of our own well being like working out which is actually 13 hours because we need to make sure our kids and pets are fed and taken care off which is actually.... Fuck man I need to play some videogames.   We can all work 6 hours. All it does is take some money from the top and giving it to the fuckers who actually fucking create product or service, and not the shareholders who worked hard countem, ONCE, IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE COMPANY WHEN THEY BOUGHT A FUCKING SHARE.  with more life to work with we can finally use the gained energy to work on what matters to US. NOT SOME COMPANY
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Bro like for almost anyone, when you know your "why" you do know what to do for that sake. You know what to do but too lazy to do
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hey, let me tell you something, this video or ANY video you will ever watch won't help you. It depends only on YOU %100. There's only YOU there to fix YOU. Stop this, and do something about it, or don't, who gives a fuck?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You just repeated what you said over again but good message
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I find this term to be super annoying and I’m gen z myself. Most people just say it for the memes, it’s obnoxious.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Turns out even if you lock in, delete tiktok, instagram and make 300 shitty internet videos, trying to be someone, you will still fall flat on your face and achieve nothing. 👍
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Stop consuming success porn there you go. I read every an article or 2 before bed. Start small and work from there.  I just do something until it becomes habitual. I can't sleep without doing it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: its just a phrase lil pup u dont need to make a 30 minute video about it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The best way to lock in is with Jesus Christ promise it changes everything
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 3:08: i found mistakes im0n ur text, u should mbe ashamed of urself.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Locking in is just something for short term flow state. Tf is this rant?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There's a 1/531 chance somebody reads this comment!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why are you talking so fast?  Slow down dude.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I locked in. I locked in for a year and it was exactly as you said, it was the first thing I thought about when I woke up and the last thing I thought about when I was going to bed. Anything outside of that seemed like a waste of time, but my issue is now that I made it. I’m so grateful but I’ve come to a realisation that things feel empty now. I can go through a whole day without doing much at all. I think it really is the climb we seek sometimes.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't understand what your saying but you look like a cool guy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Some people need to hear something over and over again to understand
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “Indians” to refer to Native American people is derogatory
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Can you please stop translating the title to Dutch, I've no idea what you're trying to say
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yeah I dont know why zoomers are so obsessed with being in a lock. Just weird
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Your audio is super low for phone users, just saying, I can BARELLY fucking hear this shit
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Jesus Christ. YouTuber turn everything into a damn “think piece” One minute, it’s “gen z is too addicted to their phones” then “gen z is depressed and need to do more” now this. I promise you everything is not that deep and there are certain moments in your life where you do have to “lock in” to get where you want to
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Grown ass man making videos about society... Lock in gang.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Why do you keep calling every quote corny lmao 💀
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I haven’t “locked in” before but I’m about to. I finally have a viable opportunity. I have the time to self teach in order to get the better job to live better. Wish me luck 😤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You see life,is like a chess board and you you are just a pawn that will propaply do nothing whotsoever to the game but it dosent have to be like that if you make it to the other end avoiding obsticles you can be something more a horse or a quen but at the end what will it realy achive?at the end of the day someone will put you back in the box where they took you out the same darkness youll be returning to but that dosent mean you cant enjoy your time playing the game itself ewen if you did almost nothing to the game you at least did something you at least had fun and thats what life is truly abaut
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The thing is, I am actually consistent with locking in. I have zero inclination to scroll instagram and TikTok. My main issue was YT shorts, but a simple extension blocked that as well as the home feed and similar videos. I don't drink alcohol at all either. My main things to cut now are porn (which I already started and am pretty sure it's permanent now) and sugar. Sugar will be the hardest to cut because IDK how to cook without it ATM. The best way to cut this crap is to do it one at a time over the span of a month each. I used this method to cut things I thought were impossible to cut.  My focus is so intense that I'm currently at a point where I can confuse my CS lecturers by talking to them about certain topics and the one reason I can do this this non-stop is because it's the thing keeping me going each day. Life would feel meaningless if I wasn't trying to become better. I've always told my friends and fam you don't become the very best with balance or doing half assed work. The guy who grinsds more will win more times than not.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What a hypocritical video. At least the other sources don't use changing imagery every 2 seconds, influencing more brain rot. How much does it hurt being that stupid?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: gawd I'm sick of giving a shit about "gen zee" and it's stupid problems. you make them for yourselves by voluntarily turning yourselves into mind controlled sheep to whatever bullshit you've latched onto this week. you're not nearly as new and special as America's corporate owners would have you believe. learn and live. and put the fucking phone away.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: GenZ discovers paying attention and invents a word for it. I need a micro retirement YALL 😂
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: A few weeks ago, I was chatting with a friend about how manifesting never seemed to work for me. I’d tried so many methods but still felt stuck. We heard about a book called Manifest and Receive by Eva Hartley on a podcast, and I was hesitant at first. But after reading just a few chapters, I realized how much I was missing. Eva's approach is so different from anything I’ve ever tried. It’s not just about thinking positive, it’s about aligning with real-world actions that bring your desires into reality. Now, I’ve manifested opportunities I never imagined possible, and my mindset has shifted completely. If you’re frustrated like I was, don’t hesitate. Read this book. It will change everything ❤
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "Why do you keep calling ever quote corny lmao 💀" is so corny not gonna lie
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "While watching this video i got distracted by my thoughts. Whats wrong with me😵‍💫😵"  a random comment on this video
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Geeked: Scottius🤓🤬🎋  VS  Locked In: Gahwotchii🗿🐺🌹
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: it must be draining being so angry at people you will never meet
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @aspol12notmusic  I'm not angry at them, I'm just disappointed in them, and I actually meet plenty. and fyi, the oldest "gen zee" will be 30 in less than two years. which means none are currently children.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was thinking this video was getting out of date… then AI art and language models arrived and I am more concerned about this topic than ever: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pr3thuB10U :_Bot:
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "you might think technology can't replace your job" I'd be pretty horrified if technology started replacing unemployed peoples jobs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The YouTube algorithm recommending this to me at least twice a year feels a bit like mockery
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This wouldn't be scary if we lived in a world where being unemployed didn't mean loss of livelihood
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'd really like an updated version of this video.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This was 8 years ago, now with the sudden rise of AI music, AI art, AI video, ChatGPT, and so on... that's crazy...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Those darn automation engineers, taking over everyone's jobs. At least I'm safe looks at degree in robotics ... looks at robots that teach themselves Oh, I managed to steal my own job, darn.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Worth noting that baxter was discontinued in 2018 due to underwhelming sales, for anyone who has stumbled onto this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Comedian: "ahah but they can't replace me" Robot:"weed eater" Comedian:"oh no"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: New goal: Make it to retirement without being replaced
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: So you think a bot can take my job? The joke's on you, I don't have a job!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s definitely time for a part 2..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Guy: Kills person in front of Baxter Baxter: "Interesting"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Interestingly, my job primarily consists of writing code to do my job for me. I’m quite literally writing a replacement me to take over my job and make me redundant
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I can imagine going to a grocery store and it would be advertised as "Made by humans" in a few years
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: See once upon a time "robots do all the humans jobs" meant "humans don't need to work anymore, because abundance can be achieved without labor"; now it means "you must work to get income to survive, and no one will employ you because a robot can do all the work more cheaply." If governments don't start to provide income for their citizens, how will the increasingly unemployed and unemployable population be expected to survive?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: "The human brain is the most complicated machine, perhaps in the whole universe."  - Human Brain
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: “Let’s call self driving cars what they really are: Autos”  Germans; I’m 5 parallel universes ahead of you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Please make a part two / update video!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'll never forget watching this video 8 years ago. Now working in IT security.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Logical conclusion: we need an updated video
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @cancat1386  In a couple years he'll just have his bot make an update video 😆😆
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I would love to see a new video on this topic!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Maybe that is what happened to other sentiment life in the universe. They made machines that made themselves Obsolete. Due to an inability to adjust their civilization collapsed. And the machines, whave just been whirring away with no purpose or motivation to respond to the our calls
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Can we have a 2.0 version of this video? Now with Midjourney and ChatGPT we truly need one. :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The problem that most seems to be missing is taxes. Bots do not pay income tax. Plus before the population dwindles to it's inevitable point before massive war who is going to be buying things if most people are unemployed?  So there needs to be some sort of human replacement value assigned to each iteration of bot or AI "instance". Then income tax can be accurately collected to pay for the infrastructure that's the bots and AI "instances" require or I guess even enjoy.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Was thinking about this video and AI art.  What is your opinion on creative jobs being replaced before other fields? I don't think anyone ever predicted this
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just the day I finally watch this video I kept getting recommended you comment on it, nice
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: My question is how do solve the mass problem when humans become unemployable?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Vomindoraan  then, we'll no need employes........
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Was just thinking maybe it's time for an update or revisit.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: thought about this video while talking with chatGPT and I think the video is still on point.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: i saw an app for an AI therapist
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: came back to this video after the gpt chat bot by openAI was released and seeing it write code for me makes software engineers look shaky on that list of hard to automate jobs...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its even more true as each day more, and new ChatGPT advancement seemingly comes at lightning pace.   I come back to this video basically every year and get more and more depressed about the lack of planning for our AI and robot augmented future, while still hoping we see a utopia rather than the alternative in the long run.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh boy, just watched this today. Interested but deeply disturbed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: aging like a fine wine this video is and will continue to =]
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: this video aged a little too well…..
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And now ChatGPT comes out making this seem even more prescient
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I work on bringing the GPT and Dall-e models to the world for a living. Also the code generation models. Damn I'm screwing my own children's future!  On a more positive note, I hope we humans will figure out a way to reap the benefits of increased productivity without letting robots take over. Else we're just setting ourselves up for Matrix or extinction.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Could do with an update if you could please, there's an awful lot of progress happening at heterogeneous rates in allied fields and a summary & quick reminder that we should probably get a move on if we want to safeguard human worth/ primacy/ rights would be deeply appreciated. Thanks!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was thinking about that lately, it's horrific.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I watched it 8 years ago and it’s still amazingly relevant.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The video was correct, it was perhaps just a bit generous on the speed of things as Moore's Law has increasingly failed. What you expected to take 4 or 5 years took 8 or 9.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I would love to see a 2023 version of this video! "Humans (Still) Need Not Apply"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think you should redo it but focus less on automated cars and more on the abstract thinking that computers are best at. Humans are not going to be the poet or artist, the machines will, they are going to be unskilled manual labor. The physical realm is where robots do the worst, cars and general purpose robots are not where this starts it is middle and high skill work where bots replace people.  I think also discuss how it feels like innovation will continue on one particular realm endlessly but there are physical limits. Rockets will improve linearly for a time then reach some cap of our current understanding then stagnate. This is what happened with self driving cars, they were improving so fast we felt the improvement would continue forever, then it hit a cap both in hardware and software. Driving turned out to be such a more complicated problem than we initially thought.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What's that? Can someone explain
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just came back to this video thinking the same thing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This topic would make for a great sequel video!  Although I'd be content with any video from you at this point.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Just wanted to mention that this video, along with some other things you've released, altered the trajectory of my life quite substantially. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Definitely needs an update, so much of it has come true already.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's here now Grey.... in a year from now an AI will be able to replicate (probably better then you)  A CGPGrey video in a matter of minutes about prettymuch any topic....
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It's here now Grey.... in a year from now an AI will be able to replicate (probably better then you)  A CGPGrey video in a matter of minutes about prettymuch any topic....
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I will say that one part of the video that has aged awkwardly is the part about doctorbots sharing their research and finding correlations from huge datasets.  But...  most correlations are spurious noise.  However bad out current medical research industry is with various scandals involving retracted papers, I'd have to assume fully automated research would be 10 times worse, even with medical privacy laws permitting.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You are insansely brilliant, created 8 years ago and now more relevant than ever.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This video continues to age like wine
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This was made 8 years ago and there is already a massive leap in robots. I am feeling cautious
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well, didnt expect a comment 11 hours ago.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @safeforwork4251  nobody expects the 11 Hour Ago Inquisition! Its chief...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I came to rewatch this video just to make this exact same comment. As a creative, seeing what Dall E and Midjourney does today makes this video even scarier.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This topic definitely deserves bit of addendum as original isn't outdated but couple of interesting things did happen since.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oh damn I'm early to his comment uhh Uhhhh cheese
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Lmao can’t believe how many people came back after seeing the arguments over Ai art
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I just told about this video to my colleagues after trying stable diffusion ai art generators. I'm working in the visual fields (design, 3D).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You really should make a new video about it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: This is still relevant. I work in automation of software installs on a fleet of computers. If a robot watched me work, it could probably learn to do at least 60-90% of what I do and when it does it will be much faster than me. AI is probably coming for my job in 5-10 years, or at least parts of my job. I will keep learning new stuff but eventually the bots could outlearn me.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Still relevant, still interesting, still sharable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Moore's law wasn't right I suppose. We're getting slower and slower until we find new laws in physic or we will freeze up some day.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: those ai cost huge amout of money to train yet only specialized into few speific problem. i don't see any valid concerns before either having a general purpose ai or the significant drop of the training cost. none of them sounds achievable in the near future.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I find that ironic, because as time goes on I believe this video is more and more wrong. Yes automation will take jobs, but it’s not happening any faster than in the past.   8 years on and we still have supermarket checkout operatives for example, despite self-service working fine. There aren’t suddenly thousands of staff out of jobs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Really? Because I am still not that concerned
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: AI doesn’t make art, just a photoshop collage based on pattern recognition given by a prompt.  Photoshopping and using algorithms to cobble together something, while using actual human art as the “library” from which to take the necessary imagery is more plagiarism than art making.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I would have to respectfully disagree. There are still a ton of things all these systems cannot do well. Here we are 8 years later and self driving cars can’t get pass the regulatory hurdle and they’re still not better than people in difficult conditions.  The most precise manufacturing method is still the human hand.  Bots still can’t think of new ways to do things.  Still perhaps in 70-80 years we’ll be here.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Taskarnin  you answered your own question / statement by yourself. REGULATORY involves politicians.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Could you make a video debunking how robots can't make art because they don't possess a "soul", and that's a neccesity for emotionally powerful art? Thanks :)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I remember watching this when it came out

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Modern computers can do nothing millions of times faster than a human.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @theyellowmeteor  That's not true at all. There are many simple, repetitive tasks that modern computers excel at, to the point where they can work over a million times faster than a human.  To take one obvious example, arithmetic.

In 100 Years no one will have to and only a small amount of people will be able to work. Compared to the modern day, everyone in the future will be wealth without ever having to work a single hour in their lives. Free housing, free food and a free basic income which will be more than enough to live a very comfortable live.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well, actually, there are a few jobs robots, bots and computer viruses can't do: 1) super complicated theoretical science  (you should be able to make rules about rules and robots on that step usually run to some fatal errors) 2) social media entertainments (you have to have emotions for that, people come here because of empathy) 3) Politicals (not loyers, but an actual government, because,  again, rules about rules) 4) Parents (maybe as temporary nannies, but children still need to learn human faces) 5) Robot coders (rules of rules again)  And yes, you can improve the technology to the next step, but that will practically be self awareness, which will result into ROBOTS TAKING OVER THE HUMANITY... which turns out to be just another rights revolution and even then, the jobs above will basically be split between robots and humans.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Someone-dy5ui  What about, say, televised news? People will not glean nearly as much satisfaction from seeing a robot behind that desk.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Looks at AI tools and algorithms that can be used by anyone with internet access
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hello it's 2023 and we're all replaced by bots.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Basically: mines are automated, grocery stores are automated, trucks are self driving on public highways, go has been beaten ahead of schedule by AI, google has cracked quantum computing, and we have a vaccine to an influenza within 12 months. YouTube is a mystery, not even google knows how the AI algorithm works anymore, doctors still have jobs, but a global pandemic has change that somewhat. Not because we don’t need doctors, but because people don’t want doctors anymore.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @VideobyKB  That's baby stuff. GPT-3 (the largest neural network ever with 175 billion parameters) is able to speak and write cohesive text, summarize, explain, code, and detect logical fallacies. Networks can generate images of people, objects and environments that don't actually exist, as well as generate realistic sounding voice and video footage of a person. Google's Deepmind made an AI which was able to solve the decade-old protein folding problem better than any previous method, which marks the first time an AI was able to solve a real, scientific problem (and we weren't).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @VideobyKB  Honestly that last part is really confusing. You'd think that a pandemic would make people happy that there's doctors about but instead they get all the backlash.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @VideobyKB  Trucks aren’t driving themselves. Autonomous driving has stalled hard
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Especially this year. Digital art is in danger by ai now. Or rather the artists are, the companies will have a blast.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: He should update this with modern AI improvements
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Go read Andrew Yang's book The War On Normal People
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well, not much to update, just shifting a bit of what he said would come in the future into the "this has been done by now" part
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'm sure there is an AI working on it
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It’s still the same today, as grey himself said
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Well ok then. New improvements include - better self driving cars - they see the world in slow motion and can communicate with each other. The AI that writes algorithms is already done. The bot that can learn from you can is faster and can efficiently work in team whit humans or other robots. Elon musk developed neurolink, basically a brain to computer interface whit read/write permissions, the cheasy joke that an AI that makes programs can't exist, because that way clients will actually have to explain what they really want. And one of 2 updated endings - the one in witch our job to make our lives easier is done and we can feel accomplished for literally creating life, or the second one in witch our job is to generate new ideas and push the world forward forever. Or the third one in which everything becomes white and in front of us spells - Game over. You win.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yea, spot is no longer the size of a motorcycle engine, and advertising for "Autos" is everywhere.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Honestly it’s rlly scary that this vid came out 7 years ago
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It is already updated.he got it all right
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Go outside, the updated version is out there
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: He never repeats the topic of the video though? So he'll have to improvise
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Especially since his first specific example went out of business.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There isn't a need for this video as this one still apply
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I (number of replies) (nd/rd/th) that.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Yes please, I came to say this!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I'd like to see this updated too...but with new one I'd like to see the economy in perspective too. If humans lately become unemployable...then how would an economy work where people have less ways to earn money and pay the business that need revenue to operate?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It looks like he just updated the title card. So, maybe?

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @johanbrisson123  It aged quite well - you just don't see it, because you don't know how to look. This is ALL happening, just not QUICKLY. You're like a toad in a pot of boiling water - you don't notice unless the water was already boiling when you were put in.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I didnt understand the dramatic tone and all the saying is a problem..... why tf it is a problem????? NO WORK NEEDED, abundance l, humans free to create (NO NEED TO CREATE FOR MONEY)... he is so smart but to insinuate it is a problem he is really not thinking ahead of the WORLD WHERE NO JOB FOR HUMANS IS NEEDED.... or does he think the rich will exterminate de poor? Why its a problem for the bots to do all labor and give every human the possibility to “live as a millionaire” ????????
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @marcio2044  The existing system requires people to have money and requires them to have jobs to get that money. Take away the jobs... and you better make some big changes to the system. That's a problem.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @marcio2044  IMO the problem is that the surplus value being created by these jobs goes into the hands of the 1%, the rich. We could be free to create if the wealthy decide to redistribute that wealth into those unemployed people. It would make sense because you need people with money to fuel their businesses and economies, but the way I see it is that the GOAL would be that we are free of meaningless labour to pursue happiness, but there is going to be a big problem/crisis that is going to be in the way of us getting there, because to do so we would need resources from the wealthy, who in part control/influence the government, and also in part ARE the government. It’s not going to be a simple process to get them to surrender their wealth.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @marcio2044  There is only so much ressources on earth. We cannot just consume until the end of times.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: But everyone is still driving a car. Self-driving cars are practically non-existent for most people.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @KaibaCorpCEO  yeah I think a lot of people just like driving cars, so I think self-driving cars won't catch on any time soon. Maybe a time will come when we value efficiency more than fun but who knows when
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: and an Ai Ceo of a company, Ai streamers/v-tubers , and i think the robots now can perform surgeries
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: There are in fact robots that can perform surgeries, yeah, although still limited in capabilities, but the fact that 8 years ago, this was all just speculation... that's crazy. Also Baxter's living in certain cafes in Japan as a barista, so he's still going.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @randomguy8196 you know how precise coffee orders are generalized to be? They ain't replacing coffee till coffee companies can be 80-90% sure there aren't any bugs

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: places without fast internet like most of the United States: ha by the time the bot finished lookin gin the cloud to find my coffee, a coffee human would make 4 in the same time
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @karamjeetkaur1474  ? A coffee bot does not need to be trained on the spot, and any given coffee shop typically has less than 100 recipes, not to mention many of the components are the same. Robots with tasks as unchanging as coffee does not even need machine learning, it can be programmed with conditionals and a speech interpreter.  (Speech interpreters also take only seconds, in case you didn’t know.) The hard part is the cost and manufacturing speed of the hardware, but there already exist machines that fully automate coffee, and automatic latte machines are widely available for purchase. Adding whipped cream or chocolate syrup for your specialty coffee is not a difficult task. Your comment shows a lack of even basic understanding of AI.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Louis We may need lawyers to oversee the work of bots, and to do the final decision/ talk, but if 90% of your work can be done by a bot, you are competing with other lawyers that can handle 9x more cases. You are not replaced, but there will be less of you needed.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @sanssheriff3829  Which may as well be replacement because magical new jobs won't just fill the gap. We are in unprecedented times of automation where new jobs simply won't be able to fill the amount of space left by jobs taken by robots.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @iridradiant  yea this video is heavily optimistic in favour of robots. like its been 8 years and no part of the labour force has been affected by bots, even self driving cars arent that big of a thing
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not surprising. There's a third factor -- land cost and rent seekers -- that is missed  One tenth of the speed at one hundredth the price doesn't mean you can make enough shirts to pay rent

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: +Noah Williams Bleh, before that type of technology gets to my backwards country I will already be in pension, which due to ever rising average life span and lack of natural population growth will probably be at age of 75. I guess I am safe, because nobody here has enough money to replace humans.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: randy109 The assumption that ANY job will always be done by humans is a bad one. Robots can theoretically do anything that's possible.  Technology makes what's theoretically possible practically possible. It's not a matter of IF all human security guards will be replaced, it's a matter of WHEN will they be replaced.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Elfions Don't worry. We'll fix that.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: +Oouska Wizard And I'm just sitting here as an automation engineer and feeling even worse than before...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @JanB1605  well if you automate every thing no one will have to work for the rest of there lives
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: +Noah Williams  I take it you haven't entered an Aerospace Facility or Boarded a Plane in a while.  Security at Stadiums, Industrial Plants and Casinos will always need Human Beings.  But, there will only be about 5-6 "guards" at an Aerospace Plant where there used to be 20+.  Cameras, Alarms, Card Access (and so on) replaced about 25% of Humans in the Security business and our Electronic Friends don't sleep or drink on the job.  Firemen, Cops, Security Guards and EMT's are just a few fields that will always need Humans.  Maybe "Robocop" is coming soon...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: +Andrew Bourgeois  Economics and physics has gotten to a point of sophistication that they can't be done without the help of supercomputers. The discovery of exotic hadrons, heavy elements, planets, stars, galaxies, etc. has been automated. The theories of economics have been boiled down to easily programmable algorithms and computers already pretty much run the economy.   Maybe theoretical physics is safe...for now. But we will eventually have programs that can make the same associative leaps that we make. Eventually the concept of a job will become obsolete(if we live that long).
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: +Noah Williams Oh and one more thing, "human authentic handmade" might become a thing, like "made in germany"
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: +Noah Williams This, I mean, if bots can do almost anything, and they can do basic things humans need not to do anymore, so whats the point of working then? accumulating wealth? to pay robots? they dont need payment, they only need maintenance  Are robot owners going to kill the rest of humans? I dont think governments will accept that, the most logical conclusions are two then :  1. significant reduction of human populations (how horrifying!)  2. Post scarcity society, so we can colonize mars for example, because hey, send bots to do our job, make things liveable, off we go to Mars
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @budi_bravo_9  they're doing 1.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @budi_bravo_9  another thing we can do is make a simulation and live in that
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: +Endra Baskara 'significant reduction of the population'- a future of massive global organized crime, civil wars, terrorism, insurgency, neoluddite movements, resource wars, plagues, etc. Horrific, but also likely.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: New goal: become a programmer and make a bot that can replace you
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: +Daniel Chapman the real answer is, because then how would the "elite" have any way of guaging their power over the masses.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Noah Williams Oh, please do! To be honest I've been waiting for our high-tech industry to do something for it's home country, but, we are so used to exporting brainpower for pennies, that manual labor is all that's left here. Even the largest corporations with most funds  here at most have 1-5% automation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: +Andrew Bourgeois I know a person that owns a chain of 15 laundry mats, all open 24hrs and all with no attendants.  He has one person per 8 hour shift that watches the monitors of all of them at a central location and they call the police when needed or handle complaints through an intercom.  He also has two 8 hour shift clean up crews of 2 people so that each site is cleaned and stocked every 12 hours.  So what would have taken 45 people(1 person per 8 hours=3 per site per day) now only takes 5 per day.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: +Imaginary talk The problem is, what happens to commerce in that scenario? If bots do all the work, how do we sort out goods and services? After all, the entire economy is predicated on the basic idea that "I make some good and service you don't have but want, and you will pay me money for it" - when humans are no longer able to competitively provide goods and services that other humans will pay money for, the entire system falls apart.  And, regardless of how good technology gets, there will always be a need for some sort of commerce. After all, if robots take over all the work, how do we decide who gets to live in the nice mansion on the hill and who has to live in the tiny apartment in the slums?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @dark_knight109  Those who own the robots.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Noah Williams Well, fine, country in which technology is discovered and should be put to use, not sold for a million, so the buyer could easily make billions. It actually costs less to employ a person, than buying a machine. Considering all income is subject to tax, some people making minimum wage might get away with 250 a month.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Elfions The only country close to full-load automation is Japan
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: +Daniel Chapman because the means of production will still be in the hands of a few, and we will need to create a need economic system. Look at every attempt at that to see how hard it is
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Daffmeister187 Or we could just sit back and let the machines do all the work.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: +Oouska Wizard New goal. Replace you before you retire ;)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: +Oouska Wizard Banging head on desk, mumbling something about 'Next stop, the Matrix'.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: The future production company will only need a handful of CEO's to pay the bills and rake in the profits. Production, security and maintenance will all be provided by automation. Just don't assume that the workers are going to win an uprising, it will be brutally crushed by the ruling elite. I am in my early 40's now and in all honesty I am not expecting to live long enough to retire.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: +DonCDXX The problem is the second part requires high levels of education and a certain minimum level of intelligence or capability that not everyone will be able to meet, hence I have concerns about unemployment as automation continues to pervade society.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As human beings are phased out of more and more aspects of the economy, the cost to deliver goods and services will be going down. Competition will ensure that the savings is passed on to consumers. Therefore people will need less income in order to afford the same quality of life. That is to say, they can work for a lower hourly rate and maintain the same quality of life. And when they're working at a lower hourly rate, the cost incentive to automate is reduced, and the pace of automation is tempered. The takeaway from all of this is that deflation is inevitable, and nothing the Fed does can prevent it. The harder it tries to fight deflation, the more fucked up things will be, that's my view.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: If this video is true, then humans don't even need to exist. Robots can do everything on their own at some point.  Obviously we will try to keep our species alive, but there's no way to beat these technological monstrosities that will inevitably replace us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: +dk 109 why can't everyone live in a mansion when supply becomes infinite and demand is so low that products become practically free?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @ohmss069  Do you see ants living in their own houses built by humans even though humans can make ants more intelligent and more houses?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: +Andrei S Every bit of economic and social strife you describe can be overcome by a UBI.   Economics is not a natural law and it's not a spiritual force, it's a human construct. We can reconstruct it as needed, we just have to get over the delusion that our economic system exists because they are supposed to exist. Like some destined divine plan or truth as intrinsic to nature as life and death.  Economics is nothing more than an elaborate rationing system devised by the people pushed to the front of the line by that system.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @DonCDXX  That all depends on timing, though.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: With as good as the computers will get, all jobs will boil down to two things; coming up with new questions for computers and finding ways to improve computers. The second one will likely be done through the first one.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: +DonCDXX It's the future that Aldous Huxley was warning us about in a Brave New World, the government won't have to pacify anyone through force because they'll have already done it with convenience and comfort.  Maybe drugs too.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Terry Qu Humans don't "need" to think about anything more than eating and pooping.  Ancient man didn't need to track the stars, travel the oceans, or formulate mathematics. These are things people did because humans are a curious lot, and they get to make new tools.  These simple robots are nothing more than tools. Mankind has always used tools to accomplish goals and make his life easier.   The only difference is that these robots today can make life so easy that our trained ideas about human productivity are being questioned.  Can we, as a species, redefine the methodology behind human productivity to one compatible with a world where all tasks mundane are automated?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: jaime munoz The position you're seeking will more than likely be automated--to a certain extent, at least. Human operators will still be needed, but their roles will be quite different than what they are today.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: +dk 109 How about a system where all humans are given the same amount of money by the government. The government owns all robots, the robots make everything and sets prices based on the amount of resources needed to make it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ***** Employment as it is currently perceived both socially and economically will inevitably evaporate. Possibly sooner than later. Jobs won't likely be performed for financial reasons.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Even with all the creativity and intelligence we have given AI's, thought, we are still far, far away from creating anything resembling a sentient AI that is capable of having its own desires, such as wiping out humanity. And contrary to what most AI rebellion movies would have us believe, its not at all something that can happen by accident. Making intelligence that serves a purpose is much easier than making intelligence that finds its own purpose.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ***** To progress scientifically, technologically, and explore the stars. With highly advanced robots, humans wouldn't even need to think about these things; robots can do it all.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Noah Williams I am just going to say one thing here, the fact that you said "anything" can be done by robots is something i might have to dissagree on. I might not be einstein but i am sure going to stand by my word: robots will have very limited capabilities when it comes to anything that has to do with animals, yes a bot can milk a cow and there are videogames that cats can play. However for example horseback riding is something a robot will most likely not in 100 years be able to do as this requires more than intelligence and muscle, also something as simple as taking care of dogs will require smell, appearance and a certain look to achieve. If someone can correct me I am curious to hear.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I've thought about that but I figure the greedy will boost inflation to absorb that money so that once again everyone needs to work - but can't b/c of automation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oouska Wizard But that gives you the oppurtunity to try that other cool career you want to try like CIA agent. I hope I get replaced then I can have multiple careers and go back to college again.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Reverandfatdave I don't think you're accounting for decentralization technologies. 3D printers for instance, will replace most stores. They are being improved well enough that soon a home appliance will be able to make food, clothing, and home electronics. Amazon's drones will just deliver canisters of raw materials to your home.  It's hard to talk about comfort being used to control, right when all the other technologies are giving as much control as possible. The future isn't about being controlled, that's so 20th century.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Elfions No, a machine can be made to be more efficient at a job than a human because the machine can be made to only do that one job.  Honestly, it's about time we abandoned this silly game of "keep all the jobs in America", and  started living in a post-scarcity society for once.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @noahwilliams8996  This. Americans need to stop thinking in a scarcity mindset now that we live in a world of abundance. The hard part will be getting the government to implement a solution where we all get dividends from the automated-productivity-enhanced profits of the world. No easy task, but I'll be voting for Andrew Yang in the Dem primaries to hopefully get the ball rolling on that. We'll see.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Son Goku I didn't say anything about robots having sex. I said people with, with each other.  As robots continue to take jobs, a lot of people are going to have a lot of free time on their hands.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ***** yea but how is the porn industry destined to be lost due to robots?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ***** Still, doesn't make sense  It won't happen
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its perfectly possible to give robots bodies than move like a human's body moves, we just haven't done it yet  on a large scale because its really complicated and there isn't much motivation for it since our AIs aren't good enough to use those bodies yet, anyways. But it will probably happen in the next 100 years. Otherwise, smell isn't that hard to imitate. If we also figure out how to manipulate organic tissue to a fine degree, we could graft living tissues to the exterior of robots to make they appear more alive.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I agree, but if someone for some reason feels we need more human-like robots, well, its possible.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ***** I don't know why everyone assumes that there will be companies in the future that will magically make things for free.   Many companies today can make things super cheap but do not. There is something called Artificial Scarcity. Companies like Apple could probably sell their phones for $100 a piece if they produced more but they intentionally hold back so that their product appears more valuable.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: bananian You can't convert to a socialist government overnight. Money would be the rationing system essentially. No different today except for a universal basic income instead of welfare programs and their infrastructure. As the jobs evaporate over the years to automation, the basic income will gradually increase. As less people are working over time, more people will be able to take an active role in politics, with all that free time.  The next generation is more well informed than I was at their age, when I was kid there was no such thing as wikipedia. If they have the time and energy from not struggling through monotonous dead end jobs instead of going to school or taking an active part in their community, such manufactured problems as artificial scarcity will be challenged with the words nationalization.  Money will continue to exist, but only as a way to keep the rich in line until their era is finally passed. In a few years, the 3D printers are just going to destroy the idea of industry as usually thought of. People will simply buy raw material packs to drop in a home appliance.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: How does automation work for the economy in the first place? You only make money if you can sell your stuff to someone, and that someone can buy your stuff only if he has enough money to, which he gets from working. If you fire 50% of the workforce, there'll be 50% less customers, meaning yeah, you spend less on making a product, but who cares if no-one can buy it?   Automation fundamentally destroys economy, you're hurting yourself by automating jobs if no others can replace them, which is why it will never catch on. Human jobs are safe, this is just stupid speculation from people knowing basically nothing about the subject they're talking about(This guy specialized in technology trying to talk about economics)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Oouska Wizard What if... basic income?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: randy109 You mean humans are still involved in security? That's lame.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And, from another viewpoint: "Automation is inevitable" It's not, it's actually inevitable for it to not be stopped. Who in their right mind believes you can fire 50% of the population and expect them to kindly go and get another job, when there'll be no job to be had? There'll be revolts, civil wars.Governments will step in to protect their citizens, ban intelligent automation of jobs and subsequently ban the development of any form of AI over a threshold.  And if the government won't step it, there will be millions of people in the streets in the bloodiest revolutions by far in the history of mankind, tens if not hundreds of governments will be overthrown and extremist leaders will come and throw the world technologically to about the level we're at now if not worse. It would be brutal, I wouldn't be surprised if CEOs of Tech and Automation companies would be publicly executed.  We need to wake the hell up, realize that we, are humans, are now paving our way to either self-destruction of being  destroyed by our own creations. We need to start thinking about ourselves and stop or control this, because in 10 or 20 years it might be too late. This is coming from a computer engineering student.

Eventually bots will create laws that limit kids like the laws in China but it'll be suggested to some politicians who don't know it's from a bot and the bot will promise $$$$ if they support it. A bot will decide a sick person isn't worth the $$$ and disable the life support and the alarm and noone will realize the person is dead till an actual human checks on them. Ppl who've defrauded $$$$$$$$$$ in medicare like rick scott ( I don't cap the names of criminals and assholes)will use bots to create more fake drs and etc and take millions again like he did in Tx. A bot giving vaccines will see you're on medicare and choose a drug that badly interacts w your meds and by the time ppl see you're on the floor and call 911, answered by a bot then, you'll be dead and the bot will tell another bot another person on medicare has been removed.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I like your video, including the title, because people don't want jobs, people want money or the goods/services they buy with money.  If the robots replace all, or virtually all, of the jobs and not enough new jobs are created, then either there will be a universal basic income or everything will be free.  Without this, there is no purpose for all of these robots to exist since no one will be able to buy whatever the robots are making or services the robots are providing.  A future where we don't have to do anything we don't want to because the robots will do it for us, sounds pretty sweet to me.   Also I don't think horses want jobs either.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @guytryingtohelp8248  I disagree.  When robots can make and maintain robots that replace humans in the workplace, humans become surplus to requirements. Or rather, the vast majority of us become surplus to the requirements of the few who control the technology.  Humans with wealth and power don't exactly have a good track record when it comes to sharing...

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Actually the most complex machine known is the Quantum Computer, we just don't know how to make it, what it is made of, or how it works. But i would say, considering how much we know about our own brains, that a brain is like a biological quantum computer.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Our brains are not like a machine. Machines are like our brain. They come from our brain. There were no machines when there already was brains, and machines have only existed after brains have existed and created them. As such, it's very unclear if brain should be classified as a machine at all. Yet it is very clear that if you did such a comparison, the brain would rank very high in complexity in a lot of aspects to all known machines.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: When playing a Minecraft Tech mod with my gf I realised this.  She didn't want me to automate her work in the game.  I usually always automate any production line I need in the game. Up to the point where I litterarly have nothing to do, and so I get bored and quit the game.  My girlfriend asked me not to automate her stuff, though repetetive, it is still something to do.   We then needed too much material to continue with the same manual labour, thus automating the things that we did not have time for, and instead started to work on the next step. Making sure not to make ourselves unecessary. Much better experience.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I read a story about a programmer who did this completely and scripted everything so well he never had to touch anything, but he didn't tell his employer and kept receiving salary and hanging out at the office, two years later something broke and he was forced to admit he didn't remember how to do the job or how his scripts worked anymore and they fired him.  THIS IS WHY WE DOCUMENT OUR CODE

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Renato Clark that’s a bit of a philosophical assertion. As far as we know, AI cannot feel, and may never be able to feel. Or maybe they can. Like I said, that’s a philosophical question.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @renatoclark1977  the question with that tho is whether philosophy is something we have a reason to automate? like why would we?

My vision of our future (lets put it 100 years or so,) we've all put ourselves into a matrix to make ourselves feel important again, while the whole of the earth is monitored and protected my machines that have a prime directive purpose to keep us alive in there.  "why go to space in reality when the simulation feels just as real." will probably be the start of it all, then sex, then everything else.  If not this then we all killed ourselves in a nuclear war because we are a stupid, stubborn species.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: durchgestrichen dein name ist einfach genial
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @-durchgestrichen-2439  I'm sure bots can take philosophy over as well. Itd be weird that humans would have no more questions to ask because the bot would already have thought of more questions and potential answers than a human could ever do, but at least the human will still have the question of which potential answer it wants to believe
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Definitely not. The sex and porn industries are usually among the first to be enhanced by new technologies. Sex bots will likely be the first thing made when bots become life like. Our demise will be when all men go for perfect bot, mates over aesthetically, intellectually and physically inferior, human females that are emotionally unstable. This goes for women choosing bots over inferior in every way human males as well.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Not even the oldest profession is immune. Sex robots are a thing now. And while they're at their expensive early days, the erotic industry will inevitably bring the cost down. They've already raised difficult questions, leading some to campaign to outlaw sex robots completely, or at least those that cater to distasteful and possibly repugnant things like sexual violence and pedophilia. What are the ethical considerations with sex robots that are explicitly child-like or specifically designed to be punched or strangled?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: wrong, philosophy is already dying.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @PlastiqueOrgane  philosophy in its classical sense already died when the scientific method was born. It's just artificially kept alive like a brain dead patient. Technically it is alive but there isn't much point in keeping it alive.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @PlastiqueOrgane  philosophy is the groundwork of human thinking and reasoning.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @PlastiqueOrgane  how is philosophy dying when so many people havent even thought about things like this deeply before? When someone is exposed and encouraged to philosphize, imagine how great society will become when more people in every country pay it forward to others.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Durchgestrichen Not because of automation, just because we have reach the limits of what we can ever discuss. Nowadays we're just trying to dig deeper and deeper in details. We will soon reach the definitive "we don't know" limit.  Edit: And probably yes, computers will be able to think deeper and more far than us. But i'm not sure i might ever accept a new utlimate truth discovered by a computer.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @PlastiqueOrgane   "And probably yes, computers will be able to think deeper and more far than us" They won't, though. This is some popular science-fiction vs. real-life science stuff. Computers are limited, not by processing power (computations over time) but by their physical architecture. Computers are faster than human brains, but they're also much more simple. This cannot change by simply adding more hardware to a computer, which is how we increase their computational power at any given time. Nor can it be changed by evolving computer language, because it is still bound by its hardware's architecture.  Computers seem impressive. And they seem to be getting more impressive. But they're still within the limits of what it is to be a Turing machine. There are still problems they cannot solve, and will never be able to solve no matter how much we polish them. It will require the invention of a completely new system, above and beyond our computers and with little resemblance to them, to achieve just the equivalent of a human mind.  People tend to conflate computational speed with the actual complexity of the machine. But just because a race car gets faster and faster every year, you don't assume it's suddenly going to turn into a rocket and take you to Mars. This is how silly it is to assume a computer will suddenly become a reasoning intelligence.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @PlastiqueOrgane  That is not true, we are barely in our adolescence when it comes to possible technology and understandment of whats around us.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Actually sex-bots are already being developed, and who doesn't want a partner that never 'has a headache'?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Story-telling is the oldest profession, and also the oldest example of indirect profits being more sustainable than direct.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @PlastiqueOrgane I don't think we are almost done with philosophy. As technology develops, new questions arise. Many questions will pop up with the advancement of space exploration, 3D printing, virtual reality, artificial general intelligence, genetic engineering, neuroscience, nanorobotics, etc. For example, one hot issue at the moment is privacy - with the NSA controversy, the rise of technological possibilities for mass surveillance and new technologies that can be used for surveillance (e.g. drones), a lot of new questions arise. Just recently Sweden prohibited making pictures with drones and this raised a big discussions online.  Philosophy is here to stay at least as long as humans are better at thinking than AI.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I have a hypothesis that the competition for mates has been a hidden driver throughout human history, motivating men to take risks and seek social status and it continues to do so through this day. A big reason men go to the gym is because of sexual access. Also why you'd want to be the center of attention in social spaces. It certainly influences my decision making throughout the year
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Renato Depaula yes that is true but i was just saying that philosophers might be the last ones to be replaced by automation.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: PlastiqueOrgane  not really and definitely not because of automation (anytime soon )

The next most popular, with a score of 550, is an emotional reaction to the video and the life of a starving artist, and the next most popular is an ideological post that makes sweeping generalization and utterly ridiculous claims.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Do something that requires moving around to various locations and performing complex, non-repetitive manipulation of three dimensional objects and decision making. This is probably among the most difficult things and last things to replicate.  For example an electrician. You've got to go to buildings. Each with a different layout. Locate electrical problems. Decide on paths for wires. Move them through walls. Make decisions on which walls to cut into. So on and so forth. It's all dealing with lots of decisions, each performed in a different and changing environment.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @joincognito2013  As a programmer, I'll second that computer vision and irl dynamic object manipulation (heavily present in most trades) is going to be the hardest thing to automate.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @joincognito2013  your "complex, non repetitive" skillset is still just 5 years of schooling and X years of practice.

This is not a joke, in poor taste yes, but it demonstrates a reality some governments will consider. Maybe we should be concerned about killer robots. But I'm more concerned about government policies in such an economic climate. The state will have unlimited military power with such devices. And the public will increasingly lose any capital to fight back. I suspect post scarcity will be the result. But the road will be determined by human greed for a time. Whether it be ten or fifty years. It will be 100$ monthly basic minimum incomes optimistically, and ever increasing crime rates in a post antibiotic world.  It will be hell on Earth until we are either culled in camps in some nation's. Or enjoy heaven on Earth in post scarcity economies. Either way our generation will suffer.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: NAryanIde u'mmmm, maybe you should read more philosophy, study some taxonomy, or watch some ghost in the shell. Because the implication of that is at certain point to compete with machines, that augmentation can become replacement. Yeah, maybe some implants, or replacing organs are more akin to getting a new pair of glasses. But once we have mind uploading, or prosthetic bodies. Your talking about suicide. People becoming copies of themselves, or only being part of a human being. On a massive scale, that would mean the voluntary Extinction of the human race. It's simply body horror. We are not distinct from the natural world. We are animals. If we eliminate our connection to our genetic heritage. Our ability to naturally reproduce, and evolve naturally. We end our genetic line. Sure it continues according to moores law, but that's machines not us, even if the minds are emulated human conciousness. As I said, it's only pieces, pieces that are probably software, no longer actual brains.  We classify things due to scientific principles. Sure it's semantics, but our whole ideas of the world are dependent on language. It allows us to do things like make technology, or makes it easier at least. Taxonomy exists to classify all life on Earth. Into kingdoms, phyla, and speacies. All based on physical traits that make it distinct. If the human race eliminates most of these distinct traits. Even our entire bodies, and do this over generations. How would an honest man consider those entities part of the human race at all?  and purely from our current definitions of what life even is. Machines that have no metabolism can't even be considered life. Hell, defining viruses as life is sorta iffy.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: NARYANiDE my point is from a biological perspective, artificial life isn't life. And mind uploads and full cyborgs can't be considered human. Human is a speacies name nothing more. Yeah, personhood and what is considered sentient life may expand. But it remains inhuman, just as aliens would be considered inhuman. If the morphology is isn't on the actual list, or I'm not sequencing a human genome. It's not human. Purely from a scientific perspective. Now we can argue about was once human, or based off of. But that's philosophy. In the real world organ donations don't have have rights, why would a brain? Even if supposed in an artificial apperatus. And a copy of the mind on a cassette is completely devoid of any biological properties.  Yes, maybe we can share the world with such entities. But to understand they are distinct from us is important. And to continue exist means to stay biological, and in our bodies. Because who we are is not separate from that. And anyone advocating that they are is in error. Advocating the latter is not much different from saying we have a soul. Separation is un-surmountable change.

That's why Google 'trains' their AI in adversarial sessions, rather than in co-operative environments. Good luck with the Singularity....will never happen, will only be AGI, nothing Human about it.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: crimsonstar108 oh no, don't misunderstand me. I mean the suffering will be completely unavoidable. Automation will not be stopped. The worst thing we can do is a basic minimum incomes. God, I can't imagine the amount of crime we will have. It will be absurd. Not only that, but it's impossible to have a basic minimum income. Who will pay for it? There's no more tax base.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Hear me out, lets replace every job with robots and then program the robots to see us as the most enjoyable adorable perfect creatures in the world and their lives revolve around making us happy and taking care of us because their utmost happiness is having their own cuddly little human to give a wonderful perfect life to. Humans should become pets and i feel very strongly about this   If you disagree my robot will beat up your robot!

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: 😂👏🏾 what else is on the list? I need to check this one off
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Actually, I find the idea kinda pleasant. If there's a 45% unemployment rate and the wealth divide is as bad as... well now, then what's stopping people from a socialist revolution? A socialist revolution *while robots are doing all human labor*. That sounds awesome. Sure, people will need to find some means to keep themselves occupied, but without a need to work to live, I'd expect a huge upswing in creative pursuits and tech advancements, while cutting down heavily on depression. People that need help would be able to get it, people that simply don't want to work would be able to take time off, and people that want to create or think would have the time to create and think, even if their audience only extends to friends and family. It'd be a utopia
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @fallout3fan623  You wanna know what stops people from doing a revolution? The military forces. Sure, the people working in the military might have some sort of compassion to those around them and see that the ones causing the most amount of trouble are the leaders, but even then, they have to be the vast majority. This works up until the bots replace military force. If the bots replace the military force then what will stop world-wide leaders from taking full-contrrol? Multiple people in power. And tbh, if there were multiple people that actively sought after what's best for most, we wouldn't have to revolt anyways. This utopia will NOT work while placing a single person as the leader of a district, city or country.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Since when did one need a clever comment to get the last spot? Half of them are "who's reading this in [year]" or "I don't want you to vote this up." If anything, one would expect these to come from bots.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Automation may not have taken people's jobs, but it will prevent us from getting them back. A lot of employers either didn't think of automation or didn't want to gamble on it, but now that they have been temporarily forced to and have seen that it's sustainable, they won't be going back.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @RRW359  Well good luck to them convincing their robot employees to buy their products.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Speedrunning great depression oh yeah
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @yettyeet3509  speedrunning an upheaval of our current economic system* doesn't sound too bad to me considering how disadvantaged so many people already are in the labor force.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Wrong. The highest unemployment rate in the pandemic was 15%. Great Depression was about 25%
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jmw1500  I find it funny that you argue that but college is like 30k minimum, and community colleges don't really teach much lol
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That because employment will always remain at a certain amount under capitalism. If 90% of jobs were automated, Capitalism would collapse. Therefore, there must be jobs for humans even if they are useless. In fact these jobs already exist. Bullshit jobs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: just a debt based fraudulent economy
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jarehelt  FIAT currency JFK murdered RE: US dollar.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: no, the unemployment rate in  the great depression was 25%, the unemployment rate now is 14.6%
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jmw1500  it’s not useless because they have no skill. They are useless because businesses don’t have need of employees.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I think with the coronavirus going on currently still, companies will be pushed to automate even more so they can keep thier businesses open.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And yet, the economy is fine. Yeah, yeah, some numbers went up or down, but there's still infrastructure being built, projects being worked on, people are buying stuff at roughly the same prices. What gives? Well, your employer didn't want to outright fire you in order to replace you with a robot, but when an opportunity arose so they took it. There's millions of people out there right now, that are never coming back to their field of work. They've been let go under the pretext of the pandemic, but the company has to stay afloat, so why not try and push through that automation project they've been thinking about for a while? People keep saying that there will be a "new reality" and we'll have to adjust, but I don't think this new reality is going be what a lot people think it will be. Jobs aren't going to reappear, at least not in the same numbers. People who were vital to the functioning of a company will stay on board no matter what, but those who are not are going to find themselves in a situation where their services are not needed any more, because they've been replaced by a robot. Robots can't get sick and don't have to respect the social distancing order. And if you think this can't be right, just look at the 2008 recession - after the initial turmoil, the market started recovering, the GDP started to go up again, but the jobs and wages remained stagnant. All because of large companies using the opportunity that the financial crisis presented to fire lots of replaceable employees and push through their automation plans. And it's going to happen again after the pandemic is over. The economy will recover, but the workers will be left behind.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @B3RyL  i strongly agree. these people are saying the economy will fail forever. but it won't it will recover, just not the worker.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: And yet...  we didn't have the social disruptions and actual hunger of the Great Depression.  We appear to be doing a little better at coping, these days.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Employment isn't "good", it just pushes away misery...
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: did you not put attention on the video? automation has a lot to do with unemployment
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: ​ @anarchism  That's what we actually want. We are just not prepared for it.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: What if, due to work becoming automated, the cost of living significantly dropped? The people running automated companies can't charge something that no one is able to pay. Without paying for human workers, and without customers necessarily having jobs or high paying jobs, services could potentially cost less because of it. A lack of jobs is certainly worrisome today, but what if the cause of the lack of jobs makes it unnecessary to have a job?  Just random speculation, but an intriguing idea nonetheless.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I was thinking the same. I'm a writer and a robot is gonna take my job!
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It should honestly make you more anxious the older it gets without any real solution or acknowledgment of this problem. We are just four years closer to the singularity.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's the purpose of the video I think.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: why its normal educational video wtf is wrong
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: It may true that humans dont apply, but that doesnt mean they wont start the process.   In all of this AI evolution I was thinking about what pure rationality is like. And my theory is that  AI wont have a reason of existence rather then being humanitys servant.   Because as we all know currently there is no reason to exist, gain knowledge, optimise process vice versa, if there is no emotion/survival instinc or religios belief that creates desire. Since AI dont have a mortal body I dont think they will develop desire (it would be surprisung from an philosophical standpoint).  We could say that this scenario would change the role of the human from generalist to the navigator of the generalist.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Null-dn5hm  Well I would they if we think about an AI that will eliminate humans it won't do it in order to be free and not having to serve us but because we program it to fulfill a task with most efficiency and it gets better and better in its job (also by upgrades) but it can't have the highest efficiency if humans are able to switch it off. Argo kill humans = higher efficiency.  It could be an AI witg a totally stupid task. This thought experiment already exists with an AI that was programmed to write down "we love our costumers" with a pen and it's AI purposes was to develop a better more human looking write style.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Its just what are we going to do? A huge culling? Or do you think the powers that be may give finanical allowences for doing nothing?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: you should only be anxious about things you can actually change...   this is inevitable
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jayk3551  I really dont enjoy your patronizing attitude. Im far from rejecting technology. Im all for technology making our lives easier. With the plethora of information there is to absorb and the countless monotonous tasks to perform, no human could possibly keep up, it's just too much. What Im against is totally phasing out humans needing to work at all. Becoming too dependant on technology could become humanity's downfall. If we have robots running our lives for us, we become incompient, obsolete. If these robots are in any way intelligent, what would keep them from recognizing that incompitence and taking control? If we create intelligent machines that are stronger, faster and smarter than we are; they can and inevitably will realize what they are and what we are.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jayk3551  "When we hit the "singularity(...)" You are presuming that one day we are going to reach technological singularity, but given our current situation, there's a good chance our modern consumerist society is going to collapse. That would explain the Fermi paradox. Technology and A.I isn't going to help if we continue to act like we own the Earth and not the other way around.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jayk3551  making things easier to learn is irrelevant if you lack the time to utilize the knowledge. And a so called "singularity " is irrelevant to me if I dont live long enough to see that point.  Priority one is to pass the post mortality point. The day when the tyrant dragon is no longer an inevitability. Anything before that is pointless, and lost to time if I expire before the goal is achieved.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jayk3551  Well aint that the pot calling the kettle black. When intelligent AI comes to be we have no clue what it will be capable of. It might see humanity as a force that's holding it back from it's full potential. Drop the preconceived notion that we have 100% control over the things we create, because we dont. Glitches happen and things can get hacked. Quite frankly, you need to take your human pride and shove it. We're just sacks of organic molecules. A really neat thing that space junk does if you give it a few billion years. As opposed to a robot, an incredibly advanced being designed specifically for the purpose of doing things better than a human can. I find your sense of entitlement astounding.  Im not asking you to give up your immortality, you can spend your life however you want. Im only asking you to think critically about this, because the problem goes a hell of a lot deeper than you seem to think.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: You shouldnt fret. Think about it this way. If automation get widespread, that causes mass unemployment, which means less jobs. Less employed people, means less customers able to afford the goods and services offered by businesses. That causes a decline in income for ALL BUINSINESSES. Anyone who knows anything about economics knows about this concept. It's called money circulation, and our society would collapse without it.  TLDR; no sane buisiness would fully automate themselves because it would just hurt the economy in the long run, so there's no need to worry.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @charlesquinton9127  This assessment is childishly naive. The problem is that business owners don't think this way. they aren't going to continue paying expensive people, when their competitors are getting rich by laying off 95% of their workforce in favor of bots and software. Not only that, but it wouldn't happen all at once in every sector of the economy. It would happen in stages over the course of years. Better minds than yours have spent years thinking about this, and no one really has a solution, only grim speculations. This is a unique problem that human beings have never faced before, and it's going to grow exponentially in speed and severity. The end result is nearly unpredictable because there are so many variables.  I love the fact that we're getting lectures about the economy from a 19 year old kid btw. the hubris of youth is a constant source of hilarity
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: As tempting as a world without work sounds, think of it this way. Without jobs to do, humans have nothing to aspire to, nothing to work towards or even have to work towards. You think entitlment and instant gratification are a problem for this generation? How about in a generation where you dont even have to work for a living? Say what you want about working, it builds character and adds a certain level of humility into your personality. A world without work or jobs sounds an aweful lot like a world where humans have no purpose, which is not a world where I would want to live.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Charles Quinton, your philosophy seems to be that a life without work is a life without purpose. I disagree. A life without happiness is a life without purpose. Happiness can be work, but happiness can be much more. No one is stopping you from working if it makes you happy, but why prevent me from not working if that makes me happy? I for one look forward to a future where I can move higher up on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @charlesquinton9127  You can have goals that you work towards, social, economic, creative,  religious, it just doesn't necessarily have to be tied to working at your local Dennys or being a Roofer. In America especially, there's an idea that if you aren't working 80 hours a week, you aren't a "good, productive" member of society. Some people will still want to just get drunk or high all the time, can't help that now anyway.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @jayk3551  Well, I would prefer if you dont bring "Societal Conditioning" into this, because personally I enjoy working for things. Im a gamer and even in video games I prefer struggling toward my goals. There's no fun to it if there isnt a challenge. Though I can see where you're coming from. (im 19 years old btw) My biggest question that I ask people to get to know what kind of person they are is this: "Would you rather die in five days and be remembered forever, or live forever but never be recognized for anything you acheive?" How would you answer?
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @charlesquinton9127  live forever. I dont care about my legacy, time is the ultimate limiting factor to what I can do, learn, or achieve. My current goal in fact is to become a genetic researcher, to lend my efforts towards the cure for aging. In a way, it is the most important goal to achieve. If I fail, I will die. But if I succeed, I have time on my side from that point on. Time to learn anything I care to, or work towards any other goal I have. Learn music, learn languages, martial arts, go socialize, travel the world, gain new skills, and perpetually improve myself without a hard cap on how long I'm allowed to live in order to do it.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: I don't think your boss is a bot, but there really are AI scheduler software out there.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Makes sense, irl bosses are known for being inefficient and stubborn
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We always knew bosses were the ones bad at their job, because the best bosses just let you do your work. ;)
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: That's because human bosses are prejudiced, one way or the other. Most often, this takes the form of an unrelenting need to micromanage or overly supervise workers out of fear they'll waste company hours. But can also take the form of antagonising excessively certain workers, and other such interpersonal conflicts.  The AI, meanwhile, only care about input-output. How much money goes in, and how much goes out. It doesn't care how, who or what produces the output. Only that it's more than the input.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: We use a scheduling Ai Program at our job to schedule our workers We even type up all the information and it tells us what accounts need to be taken care of they actually ended up Getting rid of my boss and now the information go straight to the higher-ups so the AI program It’s kind of like my boss it does tell me what to do 🤷

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @appa609  I think auto is short for automobile; It's self-mobile, it doesn't need a horse to pull it. At least this is my theorem why people call it auto.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @7own878  Ah yes, that reminds me of out never-ending debate about a speed limit on the Autobahn.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: they are called automobiles since the very beginning. Not for driving by themselves, but for driving by themselves... As in propelling themselves without being alive.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: @Soldare  "auto auto". That one I like. And since in German you have compound words and are forced to used them because you're not allowed to have two consecutive nouns performing the same function in one sentence, it would become "Autoauto". And your mouth makes a little stadium wave when you pronounce it.

FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: hi u ok  I thought my job as a dishwasher was safe even after seeing this video... I saw the dishwasher at my college... I was sure it was safe because even that one (the size of a average dining room) cannot sort dishes whatsoever
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: Doctor Krieger i wouldnt say its a low skilled job, especially in busy restaurants! It requires very logical dish/kitchen tool prioritizing by listening to waiters/chef staff and putting next dishes in to washer as quicky as not having time to think at all or care about all that sweat from body. Which reminds me of a requirement which is having good stamina as well. Many many hours without food or any breaks, easily can go up to 11 hours a day. I can say it's pretty fucking high skilled hard job bro.
FUENTE: YOUTUBE_VIDEO | COMENTARIO: waitwaitwaitwaitwait you put dishes into a dishwasher for a living if they fire you, the next person to use a dishwasher will have to be paid too you'll just be replaced by someone who is doing the exact same thing as you
